ok one quote from robin williams,"         I hate the concept of news jacking which is what I'm about to do here.  We all grew up on Robin Williams so this is very sad. I know he did a ton of movies, etc but the real thing that stands out for someone my age is Mork &amp; Mindy.  All my friends knew how great that show was. We'd all quote it on the school bus the next day. None of us knew or even understood the insane amount of talent that went into that show.  I only learned yesterday that although almost all sitcoms are shot using three cameras, they actually hired a fourth camera to just follow Robin Williams around to capture all of his improvised moments.  Then they would leave entire blank pages in the script for Robin Williams so he could do his improvising.  I don't think that ever had been done before. I wish I knew then to study all the subleties of what he was doing on that show.  So many mentors leave us and only then do I wish I had learned more, studied more, appreciated even more the gifts they effortlessly shared, often without the real rewards they deserved.   Comedian Jim Norton  said it well yesterday, There is no way Robin Williams could have seen himself the way everyone else saw him. What terribly sad and frustrating news.  A few months ago,  Kamal Ravikant  and I were comparing notes. He told me he was going to take my advice before a talk and listen to standup comedy before speaking at an event.  Before an event I'll mix it up a bit. Before the last event I spoke at I listened to Louis CK (for the observational humor), Andy Samberg's Harvard speech (for aburdist), Amy Schumer, Marina Franklin (they are great at connecting with the audience), and Bo Burnham (totally aburdist), JImmy Fallon (for his energy).  I would psycho listen to all of them and then repeat starting about 36 hours before the speech I had to give.  The idea is that the mirror neurons in the brain would make me a better speaker by closely following not only their style of humor but also their body language, their ways of connecting to the audience, their pauses, the inflections in their voices, their mannerisms that took years or even decades to develop and get just right.  Kamal told me he was going to follow my advice but before his talks he was going to listen to Robin Williams standup shows from the 70s.  I thought about that. Should I listen to Williams also before a talk? The frenetic way Robin Williams would go from character to character, how he would just jump through the audience and improvise based on everything he saw.  I considered listening to Williams also before giving a talk but decided not to. It felt like almost too much energy for me.  How could you bottle that energy up for a talk? Maybe it would be too un-caged. I wouldn't know what to do with all the energy. So I stuck with the list above.  But two quotes from Williams I totally related to when he describes his own process:  1) You're only given a little spark of madness. You mustn't lose it.   Hmm, I had another quote but maybe that one is good enough.  And next time, Kamal, I'm going to follow your advice.     "
10 unusual things i didnt know about steve jobs,"    I was standing right next to Steve Jobs in 1989 and it was the closest thing I ever felt to being gay. The guy was incredibly wealthy, good looking enough to get any girl, a nerd super-rockstar who had just convinced my school to buy a bunch of NeXT machines (which, btw, were in fact the best machines to program on at the time) and I just wanted to be him. I wanted to be him ever since I had the Apple II+ as a kid. Ever since I shoplifted Ultima II, Castle Wolfenstein, and half a dozen other games that my friends and I would then rip from each other and pretend to be sick so we could stay home and play all day.  I don't care about Apple stock. (Well,  I do think it will be the first trillion dollar company ). Or about his business successes. That's boring. The only thing that matters to me is how Steve Jobs became the greatest artist that ever lived. You only get to be an artist like that by turning everything in your life upside down, by making horrible, ugly, mistakes, by doing things so differently that people will never be able to figure you out. By failing, cheating, lying, having everyone hate you, and coming out the other side with a little bit more wisdom than the rest.      So, 10 Unusual things I didn't know about Steve Jobs.    1)  Nature versus Nurture.  His sister is Mona Simpson but he didn't know it until he was an adult. Mona Simpson was one of my favorite novelists from the late 80s. Her first novel, Anywhere but Here , was about her relationship with her parents. Which, ironically, was Steve Jobs parents. But since Steve Jobs was adopted (see below) they didn't know they were brother-sister until the 90s when he tracked her down. It's proof (to an extent) of the nature versus nurture argument. Two kids, without knowing they were brother and sister, both having a unique sensibility of life on this planet to become among the best artists in the world in completely different endeavors. And, to me it was great that I was a fan of both without realizing (even before they realized) that they were related.     2)  His father's name is   Abdulfattah Jandali.  If you had to ask me what Steve Job's father's name was I never in one zillion years would've guessed that and that Steve Jobs biologically was half Syrian Muslim. For some reason I thought he was Jewish. Maybe its because I wanted to be him so I projected my own background onto him. His parents were two graduate students who I guess weren't sure if they were ready for a kid so put him up for adoption and then a few years later had another kid (see above). So I didn't know he was adopted. The one requirement his biological parents had was that he be adopted by two college educated people. But the couple that adopted him lied at first and turned out not to be college educated (the mom was not a high school graduate) so the deal almost fell through until they promised to send Steve to college. A promise they couldn't keep (see below). So despite many layers of lies and promises broken, it all worked out in the end. People can save a lot of hassle by not having such high expectations and overly ambitious worries in the first place.  3)  He made the game Breakout.  If there was one thing I loved almost as much as the games on the Apple II+ it was playing Breakout on my first-generation Atari (I can't remember, was that the Atari 2600?) And then breakout on every version of my Blackberry since 2000. If he had never done anything else in life and I had met him and he said, I'm the guy who made Breakout, I would've said, you are the greatest genius of the past 100 years. Funny how things turn out. He went on from Atari to form Apple. Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari, went to form the greatest restaurant chain in the history of mankind: Chuck E. Cheese.     4)  He denied paternity on his first child , claiming he was sterile. The other had to initially raise the kid using welfare checks. I have no judgment on this at all. Raising kids is hard. And when you have a kid you feel like this enormous energy and creativity you have for the world is going to get misdirected into a  little baby (Jobs' parents must've felt that way as well. Like father, like son). Heck,  I originally wanted my first kid to be aborted.  But people change, mature, grow up. Eventually Jobs became a good father. And that's what counts in the end. Much worse if it was the reverse. I didn't know this either: that the Lisa computer (the Apple III) was named after this first child.  5)  He's a pescetarian.  In other words, he eats fish but no other meat. And he eats anything else a vegetarian eats (including eggs and dairy). Turns out if you compare pescetarians with regular meat-eaters they have a 34% less chance of dying of heart disease. And if you compare vegetarians with meat eaters, they only have a 20% less chance of dying of heart disease. I think from now on I'm going to be a pescetarian, just because Steve Jobs is one. Except when I'm in Argentina. In Argentina you have to eat steak. Ted Danson and Mary Tyler Moore consider themselves pescetarians. Somehow, even the world pescetarian seems like it was invented in California.  6)  He doesn't give any money to charity . And when he became Apple's CEO he stopped all of their philanthropic programs. He said, wait until we are profitable. Now they are profitable, and sitting on $40bb cash, and still not corporate philanthropy. I actually think Jobs is probably the most charitable guy on the planet. Rather than focus on which mosquitoes to kill in Africa (Bill Gates is already focusing on that), Jobs has put his energy into massively improving quality of life with all of his inventions. People think that entrepreneurs have to some day give back. This is not true. They already gave at the office. Look at the entire ipod/Mac/iphone/Disney ecosystem and ask how many lives have benefited directly (because they've been hired) or indirectly (because they use the products to improve their quality of life). As far as I know, Jobs has never even commented about his thoughts on charity. Good for him. As one CEO of a (currently) Fortune 10 company once told me when I had my hand out for a charitable website, Screw charity!  7)  He lied to Steve Wozniak.  When they made Breakout for Atari, Wozniak and Jobs were going to split the pay 50-50. Atari gave Jobs $5000 to do the job. He told Wozniak he got $700 so Wozniak took home $350. Again, no judgment. Young people do things. Show me someone who says he's been honest from the day he was born and I'll show you a liar. Its by making mistakes, having fights, finding out where your real boundaries in life are, that allow you to truly know where the boundaries are.  8)  He's a Zen Buddhist.  He even thought about joining a monastery and becoming a monk. His guru, a Zen monk, married him and his wife. When I was going through some of my hardest times my only relief was sitting with a Zen group. Trying to quiet the mind to deal with the onrush of non-stop pain that was trying to invade there. The interesting thing about Jobs being a a Zen Buddhist is that most people would think that serious Buddhism and being one of the wealthiest people in the world come into conflict with each other. Isn't Buddhism about non-attachment? Didn't Buddha himself leave his riches and family behind?  But the answer is no. Its normal to pursue passions and outcomes, but just not to become overly attached to those outcomes. Being happy regardless of the outcome. A great story is the Zen master and his student walking by a river. A prostitute was there and needed to be carried over the river. The Zen master picked her up and carried her across the river and then put her down. Then the master and student kept walking. A few hours later the student was so agitated he finally had to ask, Master, how could you touch and help that prostitute! That's against what we believe in! And the Master said, I left her by the river. Why are you still carrying her?     9)  He didn't go to college . I actually didn't know this initially. Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg are the famous college dropouts that I knew about. But apparently Steve Jobs went to Reed College for one semester and then dropped out. I guess you don't need college to program computers, make computers, build businesses, make movies, manage people, etc. (Of course,  you can see all my other posts on why kids should not go to college)   10)  Psychedelics.  Steve Jobs used LSD at least once when he was younger. In fact, he said about the experience, it was one of the two or three most important things I have done in my life. Apple's slogan for many years was Think Different. Maybe using a drug which tore him from the normal frame of reference taught him how to look at problems from such a unique perspective. I don't think LSD is for everyone, but when you combine it with the innate genius the man had, plus the many ups and downs that he experienced, plus the Zen Buddhism and all of the other things above, its quite possible it all adds up to the many inventions he's been able to produce.     Steve Jobs' story is filled with nuance and ambiguity. People study Steve Jobs by looking at his straightforward business successes. Yes, he started Apple in a garage. Yes, he started Pixar and almost went broke with it. Yes, he started and sold Next and he was fired as CEO of Apple, and blah blah blah. But none of that will ever explain the man behind the genius. None of that will explain all the products he invented that we use today. None of that will tell us about the ipad, Toy Story, the Mac Air, the Apple II+, etc. A man's successes can be truly understood only if we can count his tears. And unfortunately in the case of Steve Jobs, that is one task that's impossible.  .   Follow me  on Twitter, for more.     "
the worst interview ever what i learned from it,"         I gave the worst interview of my life yesterday. I'm humiliated and feeling awkward and embarrassed.  But since I like to learn from my mistakes, Aaron and I listened to the interview and recorded a blow by blow during the interview of everything I did wrong. So you can listen to me interview Biz plus my analysis of what I was doing wrong.  It went up on itunes, stitcher (Android), and libsyn last Friday so people can listen.  Here's the link on itunes.   People will listen and think, Ewww, that was just awkward. Or even worse, Did James just say something racist?  This isn't the worst problem I could have in life. I've had a lot worse. But when you are trying to get good at something I just want it to be non-stop good.  But getting good implies by definition you are often bad. That's how we learn.  I felt so awkward in the interview but learning to be comfortable in awkwardness is a valuable skill to have.  Even the engineers after the interview said afterwards, what. the hell. was that?  Unfortunately, I was interviewing rap LEGEND Biz Markie, my hero. And I kind of wanted to be his best friend.  I've been obsessed with him for 25 years. He was a legend when I was a kid and I wanted to talk to a living legend.  People sometimes ask me, how can I start a podcast/business/whatever without your connections?  I have no connections. I had to reach out. A friend's lawyer's son is friends with Biz Markie's manager. They all reached out for me.  Then no less than 20 emails and phone calls later I got the news: he MIGHT call in at 2pm. So I waited and he called.  I've had plenty of times like this where the person didn't call and no interview happened.  I know his whole career inside out. I wanted to find out what happened. Was he a one-hit guy? Did he resent the hundreds of millions that rappers made later on? How did he reinvent himself to succeed in other careers.  I was so excited. I took a nap beforehand. I watched every interview I could find with him. I danced to all his videos. I even watched him on Men in Black and Sponge Bob Square Pants and I listened to his segments on various albums dating from 1985 to the Beastie Boys in the 90s.  Claudia kept saying, Can we please stop listening over and over to Just a Friend'? And I had an excuse, but I have to prepare.  When it happenedI felt like the most unprepared schoolboy trying to interview the President of the United States and saying things like did you always want to be President?  But I did learn some things that were fascinating.   A) HOW HARD YOU HAVE TO WORK. He told me he wanted to be a rapper in 1977 but no group would have him. I had to get good first.  I asked him what that meant. Practice. How much practice? Six to ten hours A DAY!  Six to ten hours a day of practice a day. A DAY. To be a good rapper.   B) HOW MANY YEARS DO YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE?   In 1977 he started. By 1983 I made the first dollar by rapping at a party but it wasn't until I had an album out a few years later I was making real money.  He then did some beatboxing on the interview to describe what it was. I wanted to know how much money he made when he said he made real wealth but he wouldn't tell me.  I said what was it like when everyone knew who he was after Just a Friend but he said he had big hits before that. I asked how he met the Beastie Boys, he said they were playing basketball together and it was a lot of laughs. He did three albums with the Beastie Boys.  He told me he invested in gold in 1990 and he still has it.   C) WHY DID YOU INVEST IN GOLD? Because it never goes down, he said. I said, but it went down from 1980 to 1990. He said, I bought in 1990. And that was that. Good investors hold forever.   D) HE CHOSE HIMSELF.   He ended up never really going in a group. His major hits were off of his solo albums. I wanted to be in control of my own career. I think this is the key thing for every artist. To always think how to get through the gatekeepers.  Too often artists and entrepreneurs feel the need to partner. To outsource the most important aspects of their life.  It relieves part of the burden. It makes it seem like things will be easier. This could be true. I've had many good partners. But ultimately, I view my full business as just me. And Me, inc. makes occasional partnerships with others but it's clearly specified and the ultimate focus for me is back to Me, Inc.  He didn't have all the methods of distribution that artists have today but he could still control his career. He told me he owns all the rights to Just a Friend so every time that song is played he makes money.  The other key thing he did to choose himself was by having multiple sources of income. He was a rapper, a DJ, an actor, a manager, a performer, a cartoon character, a show producer, and so on.   E) HOW DID YOU GO FROM RAPPING TO DJING TO ACTING TO MANAGING A BUSINESS?   He told me the key: Master only one thing at a time  And when you get bored with one (I was bored making albums) master the next thing you love doing. And that's how you keep young. If you look at his photos, he's 50 now but looks almost the same as when he was 20.  Biz Markie never made a huge amount of money. But that doesn't matter. Money is a side effect of doing what you love to do.  I always just have fun, he said. I never stopped having fun.  The other thing is, once you get good at mastering one thing (rapping, which took 7 or 8 years and 6-10 hours a day) it's easy to master the next things. You learn the language of mastery. Mastering a new thing was easy for me.   F) HOW TO LOSE 150 POUNDS. I lost 150 pounds in the past year, he told me. How did you do that? I drank a lot of water and didn't eat a lot of food, he said. And that was that. Paleo? I asked. Nah, he said, just drink a lot of water and don't eat a lot of food.  We talked about other stuff. I'm making the interview seem better than it was. I was feeling really awkward throughout. We never really connected.  I asked him if he had any regrets. Like switching out of rap right before the deals got into the tens or hundreds of millions. I never regret anything, he said. I'm blessed all the time.   G) KEEPING YOUNG. We talked about the battles that rappers have with each other. I asked him if he had battles when he was younger. I still do battles! he said.  Would you battle me? I said.  I'd battle you on a pogo stick right now if you want.  How about we play chess, I said. I had this fantasy that we could be friends. That we'd be playing games and laughing and talking about the good ol days.  And then he hung up and that was the end of the interview.     "
dont run over a baby in the middle of the street,"       The car started to skid and swerve and we couldn't stop. It was all my fault. I had sped up while going into a sharp curve. I was just fooling around. The entire road was ice. My 12 year old kid was sitting next to me.  Why did I do that? I don't know. Because I'm an idiot sometimes. I hope all people are idiots sometimes so I don't have to feel so bad but maybe it's just me.  When we couldn't stop the car from skidding Mollie started screaming. We went into a snow drift and kept going.  The snow was beautiful and white and we were over the top and sitting in a perfect white yard. I put it in reverse but the car was perched in the air above the snow bank. It wouldn't move forward or backward and the wheel just spun in the air.  It was getting cold and dark. I had no shovel and when I went outside to try to kick away the snow around the wheel it seemed almost infinite. I kept kicking but my feet got cold and then I got cold and went back in the car.  Mollie was disappointed in me. What are we going to do now? She said. She was angry. But I had no idea.  I could have been disappointed. Why me? Or I could have been regretful. Stupid me!  I could have also been scared. What if we are stuck all night? Or even worse, what if I don't stop by the pharmacy and run the errand I said I would run for Claudia!  This is a great example of what I call a difficult gratitude problem. Everyone says be grateful. It's easy to be grateful when things are going well. Grateful for kids, wife, home, food, blah blah.  Much harder to be grateful when you know you are an idiot and everything bad is your fault.  So here's what I am grateful for about crashing into the snow and being stuck in the night. I was totally irresponsible and foolish and it seemed like nothing good would come out of it.   A) I spent more time with Mollie.   She was disappointed in me at first. But then while we just sat there in the car doing nothing she showed me a game she was playing on her phone and we spent some time going back and forth, laughing, while she tried to explain her strategy for winning to me.   B) We live in an amazing service world.   I called Claudia, who called Honda, who called a towing service. It would take an hour but a towing service was on the way.  I didn't even have my phone. Mollie had her phone. Total cost: $0. We had some sort of insurance for an unlicensed irresponsible father crashing into snow banks on an icy road in the night.   C) It takes a village.   First one person passed and said, do you need help? Then another. Then another. One person helped me shovel. Another person got his own tow truck out. Another person kept finding more chains to link the two cars to help me. Strangers wanted to help. I felt good about that.   D) I learned about cars.   I said to the first guy: I think my car is broken now. He laughed. He didn't even know what that meant.  He said it just needed to be moved a little and it would be all right. He told me to cancel the towing service.  We figured I had front wheel drive. I didn't know what that was. He said, it means the front wheels drive. Not the back wheels.  And he showed me where the strap goes when a tow truck tows another car.   E) Rope beats Chain beats Nylon.   My car was really baked into the snow. It was like the candle in a cake. We couldn't drag it out. We tried a nylon strap. Then a metal chain. Both broke. Eventually a rope worked.   F) We had a party.   The reason I was outside was I just dropped off my kid to her sweet 16 sleepover with friends. Meanwhile, about 7 of us adults were outside in the cold trying to get my car out of the snow.  We were laughing this was our version of an adult sweet 16. I seldom go to parties for more than 30 minutes. This was about an hour of hanging out and talking to people.   G) I didn't finish the errand.   By the time the car was out, the pharmacy had closed. I never got the medication. And then it turned out Claudia didn't need it. Which is good because the side effects were bad.   H) Hot chocolate.   After the car was out, instead of going home, I took Mollie for hot chocolate.  While we were at hot chocolate I had us do an exercise: where does she see our relationship in five years (she's 12) and where do I see it?  We didn't finish the exercise but we talked about the importance of doing exercises like that.  I'm glad she still listens to me even though she knows her father definitely shows signs of severe stupidity.  She said, we had an adventure tonight! Adventures are good for little kids. Sometimes for adults also.   I) I got to listen to music.   For awhile I was sitting in the car alone while I was waiting. Mollie was in the house where the sweet 16 was with her older sister.  I hardly ever listen to music I like in the car. There was a top 40 from this week in 1984.  I will be honest: 1984 was the best year in history for music. I listened to John Lennon's Nobody Told Me There Would be Days Like These. Michael Jackson's Thriller and a song I forget the title to by Sheena Easton. Go 1984!   J) I felt happy.   When the towing finally worked with the rope strap, I felt Hurray!  I probably would not have felt that happy if I had just driven straight home. I got out of the car and shook everyone's hand. Everybody laughed. Everyone was happy even though this had taken up an hour of their time on a Saturday night. Maybe they felt glad they could help.  I also probably learned a lesson. Don't speed up on a curve on a road made of ice with snow all around at night. I say probably because who can predict? I make mistakes all the time.  Difficult gratitude problems are how you exercise the gratitude muscle. Don't waste it on easy gratitude problems.  Believe it or not, exercising the gratitude muscle helps solve digestive problems and makes it easier to sleep and even helps people with cancer and polio. I'm not kidding.  When we were having a hot chocolate later, Mollie told me something she was scared of in her life. Something that might happen in the future a year or two from now that she hopes doesn't happen.  I asked her to write down all the things she predicts in the future and see which ones come true. So she will know her success rate as a psychic. She laughed because she knew I was making fun of her.  I also told her there could be worse things. And she said, like what?  And I said, well, I could've run over a baby while driving the car just now. She laughed, why would there've been a baby crawling across the road in the middle of the night?  Well, I said, I don't know. But that would be worse.     "
the idea matrix what changed everyones life after choose yourself,"     90% of the feedback I got about Choose Yourself was about one thing: How to bridge harsh reality with the world of imagination: how to become an Idea Machine.  For my whole life I felt like a stray dog, dashing around until I could survive in the jungle. But I was lost and it took a long time.  And I get it. I was dead on the ground. I was broke. I was separated. I was fired. I was scared. Scared and lonely.    Everywhere I looked I couldn't believe people knew how to smile. They were faking it, I thought.  In Choose Yourself I describe the first tiny steps I took to get off the ground.  Well, actually, the second. Because the first was horribly embarrassing. I pretended to be a psychic on Craigslist just so I could make friends.  But ignore that. I was lonely and just needed to reach out into space.  Specifically, I tried to improve physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually each day. Just a little bit each day. The 1% rule. Improve 1% a day.  They are all equally important. If you sit on a four legged chair, you are firm on the ground. A three-legged chair, and a strong wind will blow you over. And below that, you fall easily.  But ideas are the currency of this economy. NOTHING else. Which drove me to my next book, The Choose Yourself Guide to Wealth I focus a lot more on ideas:   why ideas are the NEW CURRENCY of the 21st century, a century already defined by declining currencies and more volatile employment  why ideas are so closely linked to wealth.  how to create good ideas and sell them and negotiate the highest value for them.  how to avoid other people's bad ideas   This is not a self-help book. It's exactly what I did for myself. I know it worked for me. I had ideas first, wealth second. It ONLY worked in that direction.  At my worst moments, I had no ideas. All I could do was work on the ideas for others, even bad ideas, because I needed a paycheck.  Then I had bad ideas. But bad ideas come back at you with loan shark prices and you HAVE to pay.  Good ideas are a link between the real world and the world of myths and dreams.  I needed to survive, I needed to pay for my family. I was going through a divorce. I was dating people maybe not so good for me. I was miserable all the time and I was scared it was only going to get worse.  And often it did get worse. Often there is no bottom until you make the active effort to climb out of the hole which I did by keeping my health up and being only around people who loved me and who I loved.  But then I created the attached image. This is when I finally took the red pill instead of the blue pill: THE IDEA MATRIX (see the attached image).  And ever since, my life has 100% changed every six months. I can't even believe the ways in which it has changed. I can't say better or worse. But I'm not crying on the floor anymore, pretending to be a psychic.    The bottom axis starts off when you are working solely on the ideas of others.  This is not necessarily bad but it basically means you are an employee and you are an idea slave to someone else's whims.  You could get fired. Your boss could have bad ideas and go broke. There is no loyalty. You are not in control. You feel stuck all the time.  On the top right is when you are an idea machine: you are non-stop working on good ideas that help the lives of others. You mind dips into dreams and you make them reality or art or abundance.  Peter Thiel underlined this for me when he told me the story of Mark Zuckerberg turning down Yahoo's offer of $1 billion. Zuckerberg would've made $250 million. Peter wanted him to take, or at least consider, the idea.  Zuckerberg decided in ten minutes time: No.  As Peter put it: ideas were more valuable to Mark than money.  Not everyone is going to create Facebook. I never will. But everyone could create abundance in this upper right corner. Wealth is the side effect of being an idea machine.    I've been at the bottom left corner many times. When I was working a job where I'd keep my office door locked all day long. I had to write an instruction manual for some chip.  I was horrible at it. You see how many grammar mistakes I make in these posts? I was worse then.  My boss even called me into his office and yelled at me, don't you take any pride in your work?  I'd leave work at 4:45 on the dot every day so I could hitch hike home. I wrote horrible novels at night. I hung out with my friends. I lived with a woman I didn't love. Nothing was going well. I was an idea slave.  Many employees are at the bottom left. They get their paycheck, their hours are filled from 9-5 or more just working on the bad ideas of others.  This is not a natural state for human beings. We NEED to explore. We're curious. We want to adapt constantly to new environments and use the part of our brain that evolved specifically so we could create new works of art or production.  But we've been fooled into thinking by a century of corporatism that if we just pay our dues and climb the ladder then there is a pot of gold at the end.  This loyalty never existed and is now gone forever as people slowly adapt to a new world.    In the bottom right: where you have bad ideas but you are giving ideas to others.  Many professions exist here: lawyers and stockbrokers are the most common. Tons of ideas but they are usually bad.  This is not such a horrible thing for society. But it requires the customers to be aware of the hidden agendas of the lawyers and brokers (the fees, being charged by the hour, etc).  Not all lawyers and brokers are bad. But their job is to give you a ton of ideas and hope for the best.  Where Are The Customers Yachts? is a famous book about this corner.  When I've been a consultant for companies trying to figure out what to do with their websites I was mostly in this category. Lots of ideas, most of them bad, but I needed the client to say yes so I can charge for more websites.  Getting HBO to pay $75,000 for a three page website about Dennis Miller was my crowning achievement as a bottom-righter.    At the top left is when you are working on good ideas but based off of other people's ideas. Whoever created Gmail on top of Google is in this category.  Whoever buys a losing business and turns it around is here. There is money here, just not as much as the upper right.  I was in this category when I worked at HBO. I was initially hired to do some basic computer programming for them (idea slave) but then I started pitching them ideas that I could do for their website.  I was still under their umbrella but I was able to become an entre-ployee by working on good ideas within the umbrella idea of HBO.  I made more money this way, had some fun, got some promotions, but I was still an employee.    See in the middle where it says disobedience? I don't mean like a kid running away from home for the first time. Because the kid always comes back. I came back. Again and again.  This is where you break free from the system. Where you realize that everything is a stage set and now it's time to get to work.  This is where you say sorry instead of asking for permission.  This is where you wake up and everyone's attached to a tube and you pull the tube out and maybe then, just like in the movies, you learn karate and fall in love.    At the top right is the IDEA MACHINE.  Nothing can stop you.  This is where abundance is. This is where seeds are planted. This is where you dip into other dimensions not yet created.  A few months ago I wrote Amazon a list: 10 Ideas for Amazon to Improve their Self-publishing division. They liked the list.  They flew me out there, showed me all the different departments, showed me what they were working on, and it was a lot of fun.  I even took a photo of the very first Starbucks.  They didn't pay me but I got to meet everyone, I got to be at the center of the universe for publishing, and I planted a seed.  Who knows where those seeds can grow in the future and what abundance can be created. The top-righter idea machine plants lots of seeds. Builds many bridges into the world of dreams.  But we have to pay the bills.  I've also made a lot of money in this area. One time I had a set of ideas for a company. They invited me to go on their board where I ended up making a lot of money as they implemented my ideas. This has happened to me many many times.  Just yesterday I spoke to someone and gave him five ideas for how he could build a substantial business. I didn't mention my involvement at all. But if he does well, I'll do well. It always works out this way.  Every day I try to plant seeds.  What about big companies, like Facebook or Apple. Are they in this quadrant? Of course! Facebook is a great example: they set up the platform so that everyone can aggregate information about their identity into one place. They basically generate non-stop ideas for a billion different people around the world who want to communicate and share their online identities.  Despite all the complaints you read in the media, everyone I know uses Facebook, including the people making the complaints.    Claudia asked me about Marcus Lemonis, who stars in The Profit and I've been begging to get on my podcast. Where is he on this matrix?  Two places. He buys declining businesses and helps turn them around. This is in the top left: take an idea from someone else and start to throw good ideas at it.  But he's also in the top right. He's an idea machine.  He takes his simple concept of turning around companies, applies it to MANY companies and now he's making a TV show out of it. He gets 40,000 emails for help from business each week. What a way to guarantee he has non-stop opportunities!  Where are you on this matrix right now? Where can you be in six months?    When I was a kid I looked up to my dad. I thought he was an idea machine. No matter what the problem, he had a solution. If I argued back, he'd show me where I was wrong. And I was always wrong.  He built up a good business and went public. But then it went bankrupt, he went broke, he got depressed, and he let it stop him. I don't know if he ever had a good idea again.  At my worst moments I thought I was turning into him. I would cry to therapists that I was turning into him. Someone who would sit all day and do nothing until he died. They would assure me for $200/hr that I wasn't. But how could they know?  But the daily practice I describe everywhere gives me the energy to come up with ideas, and to come up with ideas for coming up with ideas. I write down ten ideas a day no matter what.  Being scared and lonely happens in a cycle. It effects all of us. Even a little bit each day. Watching the river go into the ocean sparks a little bit of that loneliness.  We're meant to often feel lonely and scared. It allows us to re-calibrate where we are and ask the important question: is this what I'm supposed to be doing right now?  When I am most fearful is EXACTLY the time when I want my idea muscle humming, when I MUST write those ten ideas a day down and become an idea machine.  It's when I'm most scared that I get out of bed and I know that today is the day I can do anything I want to.  It's not an affirmation. Or wishful thinking. Or the words of a song.  It's a box I check when I'm done writing my ideas down.  KA-BOOM!     "
its ok if you dont,"       I feel inadequate. And there's not much I can do about it. Or even want to do about it. I actually like the feeling.  I had a lunch today with a guy who worked in the mailroom at Hannah-Barbera which made all my cartoon favorites from the 70s: The Flintstones, Scooby-Doo, The Jetsons, and so on.  He used to pitch ideas every day to Joe Barbera. I was working in the mailroom but I kept coming up with ideas for cartoons. I would send them up to Joe Barbera and I had no idea if he would like them or not. Then eventually he pulled me over and I started helping on all the scripts.  I mentioned some of my favorite cartoons from the 70s. You know that one with Scooby Doo and the Harlem Globetrotters? I said. I wrote all of those, he said.  What about Space Ghost?  I wrote that.  What about the Jetsons? Wrote it.  And so on. Impressive guy. He killed himself at one thing for 30 years and wrote all these classics I grew up on.  I've met or interviewed so many people in the last year. In the last five years. In the last 25 years. People who have amazed me. I try to learn from them and sometimes I can learn a little bit.  When I meet someone I try to learn one thing that I will never forget. It adds up.  Like how someone got inspired by a pencil to build a hundred schools in third world countries (Adam Braun) or about someone who wrote lyrics every day while 97% of his friends were killed by the time his childhood was over and then he made the bestselling song of 1995 (Coolio).  Or the Congressman obsessed with meditation Or the other congressman who is now running for President. Or the 72 year old who runs the largest beer company in the country.  Or people who work 90 hours a week chasing their dreams.  I admit: I'm not really that driven. I like to read. I like to write. I like to tell my story.  You know what my basic story is? Fear.  I was desperately afraid I couldn't feed my family. I made a lot of money. I thought I would never have to worry forever. Then I fell in love with someone. Then I lost it all. Made it back. Lost. Made. Lost. Made.  What a roller coaster! I wasn't making dreams. I just wanted to feed my family.  I think I came up with a strategy to keep me balanced. To allow me to grow and flourish instead of just worry. But really, past that, I don't care.  I'm happy I feed my family now after such a roller coaster. I don't want to own a basketball team. Or end aging. Or go to the moon.  At some point I gave myself permission:   It's ok if you don't know what you want to do next.  It's ok if you're scared. Scared shitless.  It's ok to not write a bestselling novel.  It's ok to leave early.  It's ok to not be a billionaire.  It's ok to not start a charity that ends malaria.  It's ok to get fired or to fail. Or even worse, to lose someone's money. That happens sometimes.    I try hard at everything I love. When I love something I want to obsess on every part of it. This has caused me problems in relationships when I obsess.   It's ok to be in hard situations that you can't solve.  This is why I have to remind myself every day to focus on health. Be around good people. Be creative. Be grateful. Once a day I save my life by reminding myself of that.   That's ok that I have to remind myself of that or lose everything. Again.   It's ok if not everyone likes me. Sometimes it surprises me who doesn't like me. I think I get surprised like that at least once a day. I got surprised like that yesterday.   It's ok to be stuck sometimes. To know that you have talents but to have no idea how or when or why to apply them. Being stuck is a huge signal it's to time to change. That's not a bad thing. It's a good thing.   it's ok to take time ordering.  It's ok to not have opinions.  Whenever you argue, people are always ready with pointy sharp facts. If one person has the facts for X, then another has the facts for -X.   There's lots of intelligence tests out there. Like: Google asks these questions at interviews. How marbles would fit in all of outerspace? I look at those questions. I can't answer any of them. That's ok too.   Sometimes I forget to return an email. I really liked a person and they sent an email and then I forget to reply. I look back months later and see I made a draft but never hit send. Sometimes that's ok. But sometimes it prevents me from being friends with people I like.  I like beating my 13 year old daughter at tennis! But guess what? We played for the first time in months this past weekend and she was hitting stronger and faster.  Pretty soon she will beat me. I guess that's ok also. Children should get better than their parents.  A friend of mine is a super-genius. He stopped by yesterday to show me his latest invention. He came up with a new molecule to put into a vaping device (an electronic device that lets you smoke without the actual smoke.)  He made a special concoction so instead of smoking nicotine he's the first person to ever smoke vitamins. We loaded it up with vitamin B12 and each took about 10,000 times the recommended daily allowance.  He took his blood before and after. Sure enough, 10,000 times more b12 was in his blood than before.  He said, this goes right into the bloodstream. As opposed to taking it in pill form where none of it goes into the bloodstream. That whole $28 billion vitamin industry is a scam.  We vaped Vitamin B12 for about an hour and then I went to my cartoonist lunch and then over to do a podcast with Stephen Dubner who wrote Freakonomics.  I was thinking to myself, I'm the second person in history to smoke Vitamin B12. I'm like the Buzz Aldrin of that vitamin.  Claudia incidentally, was number three. We're vita-nauts.  Dubner and I were talking about what the saddest truth in life was. He said, as if it were obvious, you mean other than dying?.  I said dying to me sounded like the happiest truth about living. That being born was a pretty sad truth.  Once your born you have to excrete food for the rest of your life. That's like God's punishment for eating that apple. Once we were eating apples we had to shit them out.  I said I wouldn't mind if I died tomorrow. I'm not depressed or anything. But life has been pretty good to me so I don't really sweat dying.  It's ok if I want to die occasionally without being depressed. Who cares? We all have to die sometime.  Dubner and I did six straight podcasts in a row. We're probably going to release the podcasts in a month or so. I had a lot of fun. Not because of the podcasts but because we've been friends for 15 years almost. I'm vaguely ahead in a backgammon match that we started in 2003.  What are you up to next? he said when we were leaving the studio.  I said, I don't know. Probably go home and go to sleep. I'm pretty tired. It's ok if I go to sleep at 7pm if I'm tired.  And that's exactly what I did.  A day in the life.     "
july 4th is a scam,"     The last time I visited my congressman  (when I was 12 years old), he was both drunk and senile and I couldn't understand a word he said. His administrative assistant had to translate everything he said. And then he got re-elected four more times before finally dying. Did he really represent my interests?  I'm the most apolitical person I know. But I do like to think of things that can improve the country. Let's forget July 4 th  for a second, which was a war fought mainly between the values of the East India Company and the values of colonial tea smugglers that cost the lives of the children of 35,000 mothers. Note we tried to invade Canada twice to get them to help us but they would have none of it. Now they are our biggest supplier of oil. Go Canada!  Most importantly, lets not view the Constitution as gospel. Countries, people, systems, technology evolves. As they do, its important to see what from the past is good and what can be discarded.  I'm talking about the Legislative Branch in our system of checks and balances. It costs us billions a year, its fully corrupt, and is taking perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars out of our economy through inefficient allocations.   Time to Replace the Legislative Branch with Mass Internet Voting on the Issues         But don't we need it? Don't we need to Check the President? Of course! So lets YOU AND I do it!  I'm not going to rant. I hate blogger rants. So here it is:   1) The Founders, who were all male, white, landowners, didn't trust the servants.  Several were on record saying the servants (and certainly not women or slaves) should not vote since their votes would just go the way of the landowner. (Noted HBO star, John Adams said, menwho are wholly destitute of property, are also too little acquainted with public affairs to form a right judgment, and too dependent upon other men to have a will of their own.) So they wanted to set up a system where even if the masses were against an issue, the landowners could force it through. Hence, Congress, since it was almost certain that a landowner (at that time) would have the means, money, and wherewithal to be elected (it's still true).   2) Congress was needed because information was slow to travel.  Everyone had to be gathered in Washington DC to communicate with each other (there were no phones, telegraph, or Internet then) to get the information about laws that needed to be passed and then to vote . This is obviously no longer necessary since we now have the Internet.    3) It wasn't until 1919 that people were even allowed to vote for their Senators (Senators were selected by state legislatures) so half of the legislative branch was two levels removed from the masses until recently anyway, ,which again shows the original inclinations of the Founding Fathers.  So what should we do:  1)  Get rid of the whole thing . Shut down Capitol Hill and make it a museum. Get rid of Congress and replace it by a true democracy. In a democracy we each have a vote and get to vote on the issues important to us.  2)  Every single citizen should have the right to directly vote  on laws via the internet. Only 19% of Congress admitted reading the healthcare bill last year. Which is probably why the courts keep overturning parts of it and its hard to implement. So Congress is probably even less informed then the masses. Get all the information online. We'll vote directly from our homes, thank you. No help necessary by our Senators.  3)  How would laws get introduced?  Most major legislation is introduced by the President anyway in his State of the Union address and then is put together by whoever his stooges are in Congress. Now people can submit laws based on a Digg-like system and the laws that are voted to the top are the ones we'll vote on. Chances are the President's suggestions would still rise to the top but instead of being voted on by a basket of his friends, it would be voted on by We the People. In most cases, we don't really need new laws. The first law passed in 2011 was the Polar Bear Delisting Act that took polar bears off the endangered species list? Do you really need to spend billions of infrastructure to get that law on the table and passed.  4)  The President and Supreme Court are still there to provide checks and balances  on anything outrageous. But my guess is this would get millions of people more involved in the political system than are currently involved.  5)  The costs of lobbying would go up astronomically . You no longer can just buy dinner and a prostitute for your local congressman to corrupt him. Now you'd have to spend tens of billions on TV and newspaper advertising/manipulation to convince the masses of a law. Would probably save those industries from extinction.  6)  The House &amp; Senate costs tens of billions to maintain  and they can hardly be considered to represent us anymore in an information age where access to all information on laws and bills are at our fingertips anyway. The legislative branch should be made up of you and me, not the incumbents that get elected year after year automagically.  7)    No more earmarks.  No more deals for bridges to nowhere in exchange for highways to hell. This will save billions in inefficiently allocated capital.  How much fun would this be? We'd all get to really vote. We don't currently live in a democracy, by definition. We live in a republic where we chose others to represent us on important issues. Heck, we don't even directly elect the president (hence the Electoral College). We elect electors by state and then they elect the President.  Lets get rid of the electoral college and the state-by-state system.    Two reasons:   1)  Why can't we all just directly elect the President?  Why does it have to be state by state? There's only 4 states that aren't blue states or red states. So most people feel their vote is meaningless anyway because of the current system. Let's do away with it.  2)  Again, the electoral college was set up just in case the people went a little crazy . The electors could take charge and put someone in power more to their liking. Note that your elector doesn't have to vote for the person you think he has to vote for. He can vote for anyone he wants (example: in 1972, a Nixon elector voted for the Libertarian candidate).  On election day we can simply log into our web browsers. Go to vote.gov and cast our vote. Then add it all up (not by state, but by human) and see who wins? Easy!  Finally, lets get to July 4 th  and the reasons we fought for Independence. I put it in quotes because the majority of people still couldn't vote (so couldn't be considered independent) in the first 20 or so elections. (e.g. women, African-Americans). And after our Independence we genocided another 10 million Native Americans so I'm not sure what values make us so great but whatever.        It's just history:   A) We supposedly were upset about  taxation without representation.  But the Stamp Act, the Sugar Tax, and the Townshend Acts  were all repealed  before the war even started. So all the things you read about in grade school were just wrong.  B) Two things were happening: the East India Company was going bankrupt because prices on tea were being kept artificially high. So the Tea Act reduced the duties so that we would actually get  CHEAPER TEA.  But guess what: smugglers were already selling 900,000 lbs of tea (versus East India's 560,000 lbs) so they were pissed off! Hence they riled people up and organized the Boston Tea Party, which led to the Intolerable Acts, which led to every able-bodied 18 year old in the country invading Canada to get the British out. Canada promptly told us to get the hell out and the rest of the war was fought near our homes.  C) Well what about our values?  England got rid of slavery in all of its colonies in 1833  and allocated money to directly buy the slaves from slaveowners in every colony. 620,000 people died in the Civil War 30 years later. A war that would've been totally avoided if we had no Revolutionary War. And the only reason Lincoln freed the slaves was because we (the North) were losing that war and needed help. That war was also fought over economics: the South wanted to control their own tariffs on the enormous amount of cotton being shipped abroad. So they seceded so the wealthier North wouldn't get to play with that money. Again, Britain would've just freed the slaves 30 years earlier than they would've been if we were still a colony or, by then, a commonwealth. (I'm summarizing 50 history textbooks so I'm sure there's room to criticize me but I'm largely correct here).  D) Canada is still a commonwealth. Queen Eizabeth is their queen. Does it matter at all? Of course not! Canada avoided Iraq also. Politics is not only useless, it kills people.  Before people argue with me, this was not intended as a rant.  It's good to question the institutions we hold dear . That's real checks and balances in an evolving world. Things get better when technology and information exchange get better. The Constitution no longer reflects the new reality.  A)  These institutions are never as dear as we think.  The killing of 10 million Indians shows us that.     B)  With the Internet, information flows more freely.  We don't need to be in DC to get information. We don't need to have people represent us. Instead of  reading about Bristol Palin f or a few minutes we can read about the laws important to us and vote on them. TRUE DEMOCRACY. Checks and balances would still exist even more strongly and a corrupt system ruled by lobbyists would be dead. Important laws could be passed more quickly. And the public could get better informed.  C)  With no electoral college, solves the problems that most votes in a Presidential election now are meaningless  if you live in a solidly blue or red state.  D)  July 4 th  itself needs to be better understood.  (We actually voted for independence on July 2, for instance). It wasn't about being free. Nor was it really about taxation without representation. The main act of rebellion (the Boston tea party) was about smugglers versus the East India Company.  After meeting with my Congressman when I was 12 years old my dad and I took a walk around Capitol Hill. My dad said, boy he was crazy. Could you understand a word he said? And I said no. My dad voted for him another four times.  -   Related Posts:     Bristol Palin: Did She or Didn't She?

the ultimate guide to making a personal manifesto,"       Sometimes things are just simply horrible. There's no question  some days and moments are the worst. People say be positive. That means nothing. Positive got you here.  But you only get to know yourself when you see how you act in those moments.  This is not a fancy post. Nothing funny really. No stories of going broke or being scared or smashing coconuts or making fun of my kids. No stories of dying drunk in the streets and coming back.  A manifesto has nothing to do with money. Money is a byproduct.  It's not about success. Who knows what that means?  I highly recommend writing down your own manifesto.  Something to fall back on in the worst moments.  Something to strive for. And, in between falling and striving, a simple way to live your best life right now.  Living by your personal manifesto lets you touch people. Let's you celebrate living. Turns you into someone worth touching.       My Manifesto:    Do things that will make me laugh. Do things that will make others laugh. Laughter is the one key to long, quality life.   Treat everyone as if they are going to die tomorrow. My sweet baby.   Spend time with people who love me and who I love. Your family might change every day.   Give everything inside of you away. Else your life gets constipated.   Keep my word. That's the one thing you don't give away lightly. Keep it.   Spend time with people who I will learn things from (and hopefully vice-versa). They were sent to you for a reason. You're never going to know the reason.   Books are virtual mentors. Read a lot.   Move. Then move again.   It's ok to be average if you are a good person. In most things, I'm average or below average. I'm average at following this manifesto. It's hard to be average.   Follow your curiosity. That means something different for each person, and for each day. Today I was curious about underwear with pockets and how many albums Pink Floyd sold on Dark Side of the Moon. No reason.   I try to eat well. I see too many older people in pain because of poor eating decisions when they were younger.   It's none of my business what people think of me. Someone recently called me hateful and then lectured me on the benefits of polygamy. Hey man, we're all brothers. Life's too short to waste time not laughing at the joke.   I try not to need permission for anything. Once I ask, I just let someone else build my ceiling, blocking me from the stars.   One way to choose yourself is to help the person around you who needs the most help today. Do it without expectation and then you exceed all expectations.   When I depend on others to choose my path, I know that I won't be as happy as when I choose my path.   There are many layers to choosing yourself. So treat yourself gently when you think you messed up. I messed up on something recently. It feels bad. I have to wait it out and be gentle to myself.   Find new things to be grateful for.   Listen. You can't learn if you are talking.   Listen more if someone is in pain. Don't solve. Just listen.   Worrying doesn't solve tomorrow's problems and only takes away energy from today. And regret is a black hole of nothing.   Splitting an atom releases 1,000,0000x more energy than smashing a table. I try to celebrate always the smallest of successes. A kiss is a small success. And it splits an emotional atom.   For every night, there is a day   I take real delight in people who have stories to tell me. Particularly if the story has pictures.   Every day I try to get out of my comfort zone at least once. This helps me feel connected to people. I'm grateful for the people who teach me new ways to get out of my comfort zone.   I try to be creative. But selfishly. Because it makes my brain go on fire and have comic book powers.   Before, during, or after, I say, do, or think something, I try not to hurt anyone. After is just as important as Before and During.   When I am feeling low, rest. When I'm feeling high, do my best.   The best predictor of a good tomorrow, is a good today.   Honesty, Humor, Health, Help.  Ok. Enough. I don't want to seem preachy. This is a manifesto for me. For my dark moments.  This is what works for me. Others have different items that work for them.  And I don't always follow this. I just try.  Maybe this is corny or cliche. But I will tell you what  I wanted to write this today and I did.  Life is worth living only if it's worth loving.     "
what i learned from my first podcast guest in 1980 and what i learned from my last podcast guest yesterday,"       I had a tape recorder and I was trying to tape a phone conversation with US Senator Bill Bradley by having one phone off the hook in another room and having an old-fashioned tape recorder right next to it.  I faked being sick that day. (I threw up in my throat but swallowed it back down) so my parents let me stay home. It was 1980 and I was 12 years old.  Then I psycho-called Bill Bradley, the US Senator from New Jersey, formerly an NBA Hall of Fame basketball player, and much later a candidate for President.  He's in a meeting, the secretary always said. I said I was calling to interview him for a newspaper and that I would call back. So I called all day but they never put me through.  Then around 2pm, Bill Bradley called. The first thing he said was, Aren't you supposed to be in school?  And I told him they had given us the day off. So I started the interview off by lying to Bill Bradley. Then we spoke for a half hour or so.  I don't really remember it although I'm sure one of my questions was the brilliant and insightful Do you like being a senator? My interview style still hasn't changed much.  I did a lot of interviews that year. I called people all day long every day. I'm grateful to all the people who took the time to call a 12 year old with a tape recorder.      Bill Bradley didn't start off as a very good basketball player. In fact, he was big and clumsy and horrible at it but he loved it.  He said, I stayed behind to practice after my teammates left. I would make 15 baskets in a row from each of five spots on the floor. If he missed a shot, he would start over from the beginning.  He did this through college and all through his pro career. He didn't miss a day.  He was inspired by a quote he heard from his coach when he was in a summer basketball camp as a kid.  When you're not practicing, someone somewhere is. And when the two of you meet, assuming roughly equal ability, the other person will win.  This is true for everything you do: writing, business, games, fitness, coming up with ideas, any art, sport where there are millions every day around the world trying to achieve what you want to achieve.  I took that quote about Bill Bradley from a book by Jack Canfield called The Success Principles.  Just like I spoke to Bill in 1980, I spoke to Jack Canfield yesterday.  I asked Jack when he was at his lowest and how he survived it.  He told me after his divorce he was basically broke despite having sold hundreds of millions of copies of Chicken Soup for the Soul. I was in a depression, he said.  He then went and gathered as many quotes as he could from inspirational stories and he made a book about them (The Success Principles).  He gave talks about them, he trained others to teach these stories, he taught these principles at corporations, he worked every day at inspiring himself to inspire others.  This is what he loved. This, for him, was what basketball was for Bradley.  He was over 50 years old then and he came back from nothing and made millions by finding what he loved to do and doing it over and over. He made millions by helping others find what they love.  That's why I'm on your podcast, he said, and this is the third one I'm doing today and it's only 9am in the morning. He's 70 years old now.  Three things I get from this:    If you aren't practicing what you love, someone else is.     It's never too late. You stay truly alive as long as you love your life.     The best way to make your dream come true is to make other people's dreams come true.   21 years later I passed Bill Bradley in the street.  I was dead broke after having made a lot of money. I was depressed. Bill Bradley seemed huge to me, walking past me, smiling, larger than life.  He was walking into a building on 5th Avenue that was the home of an investment bank he was about to be made partner at.  I wanted to stop and say hello to him but I was too ashamed at my own misery. So many things separated him from me that I felt like a piece of dirt stuck in a crack on the sidewalk.  But right after that I started writing down ideas every day. I started being grateful for the people in my life. I started taking long walks every day to be healthy. I started sharing my ideas if I felt they could help someone.  And 14 years later, I still do it, I'm still grateful, I still try to be creative, no matter what is happening in my life. If I'm not practicing at living, then someone else is.  Thanks Bill Bradley, for being my first podcast guest in 1980. I don't know where that cassette tape is, but I'm glad I didn't strangle myself with it when it inevitably became tangled.     "
can you do one page a day,"     When I start to date a woman, I want her to love me IMMEDIATELY. That never happens. You're going too fast, and she ends it.    When I started a novel when I was younger, I wanted to finish it the next day. When I start a business, I want to sell it a day later. Count the riches.    When I started graduate school, I was already planning how I was going to be the fastest PhD in history.    Around the time that I had initially planned on receiving that Phd , I ended up getting thrown out. Lack of maturity, the letter said.    I don't believe life is short. Sometimes it feels very very long. Like I wish every day would be over already just so I can get to the next. And the next.    An imaginary tomorrow always seems to be better than today in my head.    Which makes me think of my hero, Gene Wolfe.    I know what you might be thinking.    Pringles.    Gene Wolfe was given the task of how do you take a baked potato, press it down, and slice it up in such a way that it can fit into a tennis ball can.    Well, my man did it. He invented Pringles. And I ate one this morning.    But that's not why he's my hero.    While many normal human beings, not as obsessed with status and creativity as Gene was, might say: Ok, I just did my life's achievement. I've achieved my PURPOSE. I've created an easily storable food based on a vegetable that, when doused with a ton of salt, will please children and adults for decades, maybe centuries.    I mean, what would you do at that point?    If I were Gene (and I almost hate using his first name, as if I knew him when it's only in my dreams I imagine having dinner with him and OH, the things we would talk about, the laughs we would have) I would've rested on my laurels, collected awards, imagined playing golf with friends, can of Pringles always in tow, maybe a little belly develops but hey, he deserved it. He EARNED it.    But Gene knew the magic secret. And it is only with his lifetime (and at 83 he's still going) that he is able to share that secret.    The secret: One page a day.    Gene has been an adult for almost 25,000 days.    He writes a page a day. A page is about 300 words. A paragraph or two. Can you do that? 25,000 pages. About 80 books worth of pages.    Gene ended up writing 50 published novels, including many bestsellers and award-winners.    He didn't get stereotyped and stuffed into that Pringles can. As dead as the chips he created.    He did what he loved to do. That's what keeps you alive every day. That's The Push.    Life is too long to reject the opportunities in front of you every day.    I was talking to James Manos, the creator of Dexter. He said, my definition of success is if you can't distinguish between work and pleasure.    It's ok if right now the two are separate for you. Today is a new day.    We repent what we want to change. We regret what we never changed.    This is my page today.      "
i want to die,"    One guy I worked closely with in the Internet boom killed himself about a year ago. His father had died recently and he was very close to his father. My friend had a heart condition plus various cancers that kept coming back. He had been fired from AOL in some sort of scandal, and the company we had worked together at back in 1999 had gone bankrupt. He was overweight, had no girlfriend, had a speech impediment, and he was constantly sweating due to his various illnesses.     I was talking about him at a dinner with friends. We were all saying what a great guy he was. Because he truly was a great guy. When you go through so much sorrow you know that it makes no sense to be mean or cruel to the people around you. Finally, though, it occurred to all of my friends that I was the only one at the table who didn't know he was dead. Wait a sec, said one of the people at dinner, you don't know?  Know what?  And the table went silent. Nobody wanted to say. An awful secret had been served at the table and I was the only one not feasting on the dish. Instead someone gave me a URL and I went to it later and it was a tribute page to my friend. I've had 100 breakfasts with the guy and I didn't know and it made me wonder what his last thoughts were. The last time I heard from him he had sent me a random email in 2005 that said, James! Is this email address really for you? And, true to my form,  I never responded. I meant to respond. But I put it off. Then never did.    A few years ago Dan was telling me about a friend of his who worked at Goldman Sachs. They grew up together in the banking business. Dan said, he was addicted to prostitutes. Almost every night. He was a good looking guy, made great money, stayed in shape, and every night would go for an escort service.  If he was a good looking guy why couldn't he just meet a girl or many girls, like in a bar, or wherever? I said.  Dan said, I asked him that. He said, it's the same thing. You take the girl out to two or three dinners, you wine and dine. And maybe then you have sex with her. But then she doesn't leave. This way, for $500 I can have sex with some of the most beautiful girls on the planet and then that's it, move on to the next one.'   But then he would miss the emotional stuff.  He didn't care about that. He just wanted to have sex with a different beautiful woman every night.  Dan said, But after his last bonus, he left the city and moved to California. I don't know what he's doing now. I think he's doing nothing, just living off that last bonus.  I was trying to figure out how big his bonus was that he could just live off of it forever like that.  The other day Dan told me, remember that friend of mine I told you about that was always going out with the prostitutes  Yeah.   Well, John J called me and gave me the update. He hung himself.          (Death, from the excellent Sandman series by Neil Gaiman)      Nobody wants to die. But its hard to go from wanting to die to suddenly being cheered up. If you say, I want to die and everyone else says, oh, cheer up, there's so much to live for that's sometimes a hard thing to hear. It's not like you're going to suddenly say, you know what? You are totally right. I'm cheered up now!  Try this instead. Just think a little deeper. When you get that feeling ask yourself, what is it inside of me that really wants to die?  Do you really want your heart to stop beating? I hardly ever think of the mechanics of my heart. Why would I suddenly want it to stop beating? I don't even know what side of my chest my heart is on.  So what do you really want to die?  The times when I've thought it, what I really wanted (when I think about it in retrospect):    I wanted death to the horrible feeling that so-and-so  didn't return my affections  the way I wanted her to (maybe she didn't call back, was with another guy, didn't respond to emails,didn'ttell me she loved me, etc)   I wanted death to the fear that put itself right in my gut that I was going to go broke. A constant fear that has recurred again and again in my life.   I wanted death to the fear that I was going to  lose my house . Or death to the pain I felt upon losing a house. That pain sitting in my head and stomach which buried me underneath so many failures one after the other that I thought I could never climb out of the coffin / grave they buried me in.   I wanted the death of the utter sorrow I felt  when my dad died.    I wanted death to the fear the IRS was going to put me in jail (unfounded, but who knew?)       I wanted the death of the ongoing anticipation of whether or not I was going to sell a company before it went out of business .   I wanted the death of the horrible feeling in my stomach when a  stock I owned  a lot of was moving against me and I had clients that depended on me.   I wanted death to the sadness that my kids,  who I love , would grow up not knowing me in the way I originally thought they would know me (because divorce changes the way, forever, you interact with your kids)   I wanted the death of the feeling of inadequacy I felt upon losing a chess tournament  or money at a poker session  or not getting a  novel published  again and again and again.   I wanted the death of the anger I felt towards family members who I felt had horribly wronged me. Or the obsession that place in your head when you are dealing with crappy people. I would want the death of that obsession.   And on and on. So many different times I've thought it  I want to die. Sometimes I meant it, sometimes I didn't. But when I look back on it, never did I really want my heart to stop beating. I just wanted the death of these various emotions that were hurting me not just emotionally but physically.  I wanted the death of my lack of control over a world that is furious, and chaotic and beautiful and messy.  And all of those things did die eventually. How small they are in the rear view mirror. And a little bit of me died with each one of them.  But I'm still alive.       Follow me  on Twitter       "
what i learned about life after interviewing 80 highly successful people,"       You interrupt too much, people email me. Let your guests finish talking. But I can't help it. I get curious. I want to know! Now!    Over the past year I interviewed about 80 guests for my podcast. My only criteria: I was fascinated by some aspect of each person.    I didn't limit myself by saying each one had to be an entrepreneur or had to be a success.    I just wanted to talk to anyone who made me curious about their lives. I spoke to entrepreneurs, comedians, artists, producers, astronauts, writers, rappers, and even this country's largest beer brewer.    Will I do it for the next year? Maybe. It's hard.    Sometimes I would pursue a guest for six months with no reply and then they would call and say, Can you do right now? and I'd change all plans with kids, Claudia, business.    I had no favorites. They were all great. I interviewed  Peter Thiel  ,  Coolio  ,  Mark Cuban  ,  Arianna Huffington  ,  Amanda Palmer  ,  Tony Robbins  , and many more. I'm really grateful they all wanted to talk to me.    Podcasting, to be honest, was just an excuse for me to call up whoever I wanted to call and ask them all sorts of personal questions about their lives. If I wanted to talk about Star Wars, I called the author of a dozen Star Wars novels.    If I wanted to talk about Twisted Sister, I called up the founder of the band. If I wanted to talk sex I called the women who ran the Ask Women podcast.    I wanted to know at what point were they at their worst. And how they got better. Each person created a unique life. I wanted to know how they did it. I was insanely curious.    As Coolio told me, You got me to reveal some deep stuff I didn't want to reveal. Kudos. Tony Robbins had to literally shake himself at one point and say, Wait, how did we end up talking about this? I can't help it. I want to know.    Here are the most important things I learned. I can't specify which person I learned what from. It hurts my head when I think about it because many of the 80 said the exact same thing about how they ended up where they were.    Here is some of what they said:    A) A life is measured in decades.    Too many people want happiness, love, money, connections, everything yesterday. Me too. I call it the disease. I feel often I can paint over a certain emptiness inside if onlyif onlyI have X.    But a good life is like the flame of a bonfire. It builds slowly, and because it's slow and warm it caresses the heart instead of destroys it.    B) A life is measured by what you did TODAY, even this moment.    This is the opposite of A but the same. You get success in decades by having success now.    That doesn't mean money now. It means, Are you doing your best today?    Everyone worked at physical health, improving their friendships and connections with others, being creative, being grateful. Every day.    For those who didn't, they quickly got sick, depressed, anxious, fearful. They had to change their lives. When they made that change, universally they all said to me, that's when it all started.    C) Focus is not important, but Push is (reinvention).    Very few people have just one career. And for every career, it's never straight up.    When you have focus, it's like saying, I'm just going to learn about only one thing forever. But the push is the ability to get up every day, open up the shades, and push through all the things that make you want to go back to sleep.    Even if it means changing careers 10 times. Or changing your life completely. Just pushing forward to create a little more life inside yourself.    Compound life is much more powerful than compound interest.    D) Give without thinking of what you will receive.    I don't think I spoke to a single person who believed in setting personal goals. But 100% of the people I spoke to wanted to solve a problem for the many.    It doesn't matter how you give each day. It doesn't even matter how much. But everyone wanted to give and eventually they were given back. (cc  Adam Grant )    E) Solving hard problems is more important than overcoming failure.    The outside world is a mirror of what you have on the inside. If Thomas Edison viewed his 999 attempts at creating a lightbulb a failure then he would've given up. His inside was curious. His inside viewed his attempts as experiments. Then he did #1000. Now we can see in the dark.    Dan Ariely  was burned all over his body and used that experience to research the psychology of pain and ultimately the psychology of behavior and how we can make better decisions.    Tony Robbins lost everything when his marriage ended, but he came back by coaching thousands of people.    It's how you view the life inside you that creates the life outside of you. Every day.    F) Art and success and love is about connecting all the dots.    Here are some dots: The very personal sadness sitting inside of you. The things you learn. The things you read about. The things you love. Connect the dots. Give it to someone.    Now you just gave birth to a legacy that will continue beyond you.    G) It's not business, it's personal.    Nobody succeeded with a great idea.    Everyone succeeded because they built networks within networks of connections, friends, colleagues all striving towards their own personal goals, all trusting each other, and working together to help each other succeed.    This is what happens only over time. This is why giving creates a bigger world because you can never predict what will happen years later.    Biz Markie  described to me how he helped a 7-year-old kid named Jay-Z with his lyrics.    Peter Thiel's ex employees created tens of billions of dollars worth of companies.    Marcus Lemonis  saves businesses every week on his show The Profit. It doesn't come by fixing their accounting. It comes from fixing the relationships with the partners and the customers and the investors.    The best way to create a great business over time: Every day send one thank you letter to someone from your past. People (me) often say you can't look back at the past. But this is the one way you can. You create the future by thanking the past.    H) You can't predict the outcome, you can only do your best.    Hugh Howey  thought he would write novels that only his family would read. So he wrote ten of them. Then he wrote Wool, which he self-published and has sold millions of copies and Ridley Scott is making the movie.    Clayton Anderson  applied to be an astronaut for 15 years in a row and was rejected each time until the 16th.    Coolio wrote lyrics down every day for 17 years before having a hit.  Noah Kagan  was fired from Facebook and Mint without making a dime before starting his own business.  Wayne Dyer  quit his secure job as a tenured professor, put a bunch of his books in car and drove across the country selling them in every bookstore. Now he's sold over 100,000,000 books.    Sometimes when I have conversations with these people they want to jump right to the successful parts but I stop them. I want to know the low points. The points where they had to start doing their best. What got them to that point.    I) The same philosophy of life should work for an emperor and a slave.    Ryan Holiday  told me that both Marcus Aurelius, an emperor, and Epictetus, a slave, both subscribed to the idea of stoicism. You can't predict pleasure or pain. You can only strive for knowledge and giving and fairness and health each day.    Many people write me it's easy for so-and-so to say that now that he's rich. Every single person I spoke to started off in a gutter or worse. (Well, most of them.)    Luck is certainly a component, but in chess there's a saying (and this applies to anything) it's funny how always the best players seem to be lucky.    J) The only correct path is the path correct for you.    Scott Adams  tried about 20 different careers before he settled on drawing Dilbert. Now, he's in 2000 papers, has written Dilbert books, Dilbert shows, Dilbert everything. Everyone was shocked when  Judy Joo  gave up a Wall St. career to go back to cooking school. Now she's on the Food Channel as an iron chef.    Don't let other people choose your careers. Don't get locked in other people's prisons they've set up just for you. Personal freedom starts from the inside but ultimately turns you into a giant, freeing you from the chains the little people spent years tying around you.    K) Many moments of small, positive, personal interactions build an extraordinary career.    Often people think that you have to fight your way to the top. But for everyone I spoke to it was small kindnesses over a long period of time that built the ladder to success. I think I'm starting to sound like a cliche on this. But it's only a cliche because it's true.    L) Taking care of yourself comes first.    Kamal Ravikant  picked himself off a suicidal bottom by constantly repeating I love you to himself. Charlie Hoehn cured his anxiety by using every moment he could to play.    I've written before: The average kid laughs 300 times a day. The average adult5.    Something knifed our ability to smile. Do everything you can to laugh, to create laughter for others, and then what can possibly be bad about today? I think that's why I try to interview so many comedians are comedy writers. They make me laugh. It's totally selfish.    M) The final answer: People do end up loving what they succeed at, or they succeed at what they love.    Mark Cuban said, My passion was to get rich! But I don't really believe him. He loved computers so he created a software company. Then he wanted to watch Ohio basketball in Pittsburgh so he created Broadcast.com. I worked with Broadcast.com a little bit back in 1997. They were crusaders about bringing video to the Internet.    Sure, he wanted to use that to get rich. Because he knew better than anyone then how to let a good idea lead him to success.    But deep down he was a little kid who wanted to watch his favorite basketball. And now what does he do? He owns a basketball team.    N) Anybody, at any age    The ages of the people I spoke to ranged from 20 to 75. Each is still participating every day in the worldwide conversation. I asked  Dick Yuengling  from Yuengling beer why he even bothered to talk to me. He's 75 and runs the biggest American-owned brewery worth about $2 billion. He laughed and said, Well, you asked me.    I just realized this list can go on for another 100 items.    The specifics of success. How to overcome hardships. How any one person can move society forward.    Down to even what are the most productive hours of the day, what's the one word most important for success, and what we can look forward to over the next century and maybe 100 other things.    O) Figure out How to Make Uncertainty Work for You    Nassim Taleb  makes sure he walks on uneven surfaces for at least 20 hours a week. The idea is not just exercise, but to get rid of the artificial comforts of certainty we think we have built for ourselves over the past 200 years.  When I interviewed him I was particularly worried that I was fragile as opposed to his concept of Antifragile. That once things break down in my life I have a tendency to break down with them. His book was rooted in economic concepts but it also applied to the personal.  Getting out of your comfort zone frequently and randomly is a way to boost your anti-fragility. Do something that might not work. Be around people who challenge you.  See what happens.     Then I learned many things about myself.    Most of the people I asked to come on my podcast said, NO! I told Claudia the other day I haven't been rejected this much since freshman year of high school. I had to re-learn how to deal with so much rejection.    I've always been a big reader but never as much as this year. I read everything by all the guests.    Some weeks I felt like I was spending 10 hours a day preparing for podcasts. I learned to interview, to listen, to prepare, to pursue, to entertain, to educate.    Podcasting seems like it's becoming an industry, or a business idea, or something worth looking at by entrepreneurs or investors. I have no clue about that.    For me, podcasting this year was just about calling anyone I wanted to call and talking to them. I felt like a little boy interviewing his heroes.    I highly recommend finding ways to call people for almost no reason. I learned a huge amount.    But it was hard.    It's one of those things where I can say, I don't know if I can ever do that again. But I also know I'm probably going to say the same thing next year.      "
how to become a jedi knight 2,"    In 2005, I had a business going down the drain (my biggest customer went out of business) and I had no other source of income. I couldn't believe how scared I was.  I don't know why: but I became obsessed with The Force in Star Wars. I bought all sorts of books like The Tao of Star Wars. I decided to use The Force to save my business. To try and remain calm and to focus on each day doing my best rather than panicking about the future.  Short story: My business got saved and did well. I didn't shut it down until I started another business which did better. I love these techniques I picked up from watching over and over again the Star Wars movies.  A week ago, Disney released all six movies again. Plus a new trailer for the next movie was released. I watched them all with the same passionI had as a child.  It reminded me of my love for the movies, my love for the ideas and philosophy of the movies.  It reminded me of the strength of being calm  and of the weakness of being angry, full of fear, and aggression. Fear will never solve the problems of the future and only drain you of much-needed strength today.  (Click image for larger image and then click on THAT image to zoom in)          "
the ten worst things you can do in a negotiation,"    The best negotiator I knew always acted like an idiot. He acted so well that I thought he was really stupid. I also thought at the time that he was my best friend.  That was probably an act also. Just two years later he stopped talking to me forever.  I ran into him in the street the other day. He smiled and shook my hand. I felt warm, like he liked me again. Then he was gone.  Negotiation is first about warmth. Two sides deciding if they want to be friends with each other. If they want to be in the same tribe, fighting side by side in this harsh world.  After that it's about vulnerability. Making yourself into the type of person someone else wants to take care of.   This is not a mystery. When a baby is born the negotiation begins. It lasts until at least the baby is an adult.  My oldest turns 16 tomorrow. She negotiates with me every day. I love her. But maybe that's what makes her such a tough negotiator.  I'm not so good at realizing where all the boundaries are.  Between the outer me and the inner me. Between the me that always loves her and the me that wants her to love me back.  I guess that's how I am with everyone. If they don't love me back, I'm afraid, I'll be less happy.  If I'm honest where the boundaries are, then we can begin to set up the rules. Then love begins.  Tricky!   I've probably seen over 1000 negotiations in action. I've probably been directly involved in 100 or so.  Every day life is a negotiation. I'm not talking in this post about the every day negotiations although the same rules apply. I'm talking about negotiations where careers and money and reputations and maybe love is at stake.  For me, that latter is the hardest. So take my advice with a grain of salt. In fact, I'd rather tell you all the ways in which I've messed up in negotiations. Because this is really the classroom I learned in.   A) IF YOU HAVE A SMALL LIST OF TERMS, YOU LOSE.   Let's say you are selling a company. One side is usually focused on the final price. That side will henceforth be called the loser.  Make your list bigger: what are the terms of the non-compete, what is the length of the earn out, what are the salaries of the new top executives, what are the perks, what are the options packages.  Or if it's a job: what are the responsibilities, what are similar people being paid, what is the path to higher promotions, what are the details of health, vacation, moving expenses, reviews, etc.  The side with the bigger list can give up the nickels for the dimes to the loser.   B) IF YOU DON'T GET ENOUGH SLEEP, YOUR WILLPOWER WILL BE ZERO.   Carl Icahn, one of the best investors in the world, uses this technique.  He schedules his negotiations for the early evening.  Our peak mental ability (according to Dan Ariely, author of Predictably Irrational, and many other books) is approximately 2 hours after we wake up until about 4 hours after we wake up.  And then throughout the day, our willpower slowly leaks away until we sleep again. That's why we watch TV and eat donuts at night rather than when we first wake up.  So Carl Icahn will sleep until 4pm and then go to the negotiation at 6pm.  On the other side of the table are exhausted lawyers who have been working all day.  BAM! Who do you think will win that negotiation.   C) MOST PEOPLE THINK SHORT-TERM. BE THE VISIONARY AND YOU WIN.   Applied Semantics didn't want to sell to Google in 2001. They had raised some money and thought they could make it.  A few months earlier I had made the mistake of turning them down when they were raising money. The search engine business is dead! said the greatest prophet of modern times.  Me.  Larry Page told the CEO of Applied, I'm not getting off the phone until you say yes.  So Applied Semantics sold themselves in exchange for 1% of Google. ONE PERCENT.  This was before Google went public. So it was a total unknown what those shares would be worth. Larry Page had the vision of where they would be.  Applied Semantics became the Adsense division of Google. Which now accounts for 99% of Google's revenues.  Are they upset? Shouldn't they have sold for more?  Of course not. They sold for over a billion in value and created the end goal of making one of the best companies in the world.  You can only get rich once. Don't worry so much about maximizing your percentage of something. One percent of $250 billion is better than 100% of nothing, as the saying goes.   I'm going to take a break for a second and say something that has saved me considerable stress.  NEVER WORRY ABOUT WHAT IS IN SOMEONE ELSE'S POCKET.  Let other people do well. Then you will do well.  Ok, back to what you shouldn't do in a negotiation.    D) DON'T SAY NO .  I say this even though I wrote the book, The Power of No. What I really mean here is, bury your NO inside of a YES.  I was negotiating with one company once. They wanted me to be an advisor. I said, no. But not like that. What I really said was, You have a great company and I am happy to give advice.  What a great way to say no! They kept calling. They really wanted me. I said, Here's what you should do without me and I totally laid out the plan they should do. I did it for free. That was another way of saying no.  This made them want me as an advisor even more. Eventually they offered enough that I said, yes. They followed my advice exactly. The advice that I had already given for free.  There's a well-known improv technique of Yes, and  In improv, the first performer creates the premise. The second performer can't change it or reject it, he can only build on it.  In a negotiation if someone says, well, you're only worth $1 because you have X you can say, yes, and we also have Y so let's take that into consideration.  Suddenly your value is higher because you didn't start a fight. You agreed and added.   E) MANY PEOPLE NEGOTIATE WITH THE WRONG MATH.   This is the part many people don't get right and it's hard to explain. I'll take a simple example. I don't know if the negotiation took place this way but it describes what I mean.  Why did Facebook buy Instagram for $1 billion. Instagram had 11 employees and zero revenues.  On that basis, maybe Instagram was worthnothing. Or close to it.  But maybe the negotiation went something like this:  Instagram: Let's agree to a formula first on how we should value our company.  Facebook: ErrOk.  Instagram: Forget about our revenues for a second. But let's just assume we can earn $X for every user you have (call that number $Y). Pay us $X * Y.  Facebook: Err.Ok.  Instagram probably then showed how they could add $1 in value for every customer Facebook had. Facebook has a billion users. So a billion dollars.  Come to the negotiation with your formula. Know how to fill in the variables before the other side does. Every good negotiator does this.  The reason I know this? Because this is how I've lost many negotiations to good negotiators. I've had very good mentors on this one aspect of negotiation.  Because we all negotiated the formula, but not the price, in advance, then everyone has already said Yes to something and they basically have to stick with it.  (Well, they don't have to. But it's high stakes and you don't want to seem like you don't live up to your word.)   F) IF YOU HOPE FOR ONLY ONE OUTCOME, YOU NEVER GET IT.   I really wanted my company, Stockpickr, to be bought by Google. I threw everything I could into the basket. I would send them love notes in the middle of the night.  Seriously, I was in love with the woman doing the negotiating.  I didn't have a technical team was the problem. We built the whole site for a few thousand dollars. I had one partner. We had 99% margins on our revenues but Google likes technical teams.  Oh well.  I then focused on getting alternatives. I called AOL, Yahoo, Reuters, Forbes. Then thestreet.com bought us.  Sometimes people write me and say, I sent my ten ideas to my favorite company but they haven't called back. Should I call them again?  That's the wrong question. The right question is: What's the next 100 companies I should write to?  It's no secret that being able to walk away from a negotiation is the best starting point in a negotiation.   G) SMARTER PEOPLE LOSE.   This is what I like to say: you guys are the experts at this, we've just been focused on building our product, company, art, whatever.  Then I say, if you were me, what would you ask for?  I ask them advice. Because they are the experts. It's not a lie.  If you are applying for a job with someone more senior than you, why not ask the more senior guy for advice? He knows more than you.  Very often they give very good advice.   H) IF YOU NEGOTIATE WITH A LOSER, YOU LOSE.   If two sides are negotiating, you need at least one champion for what you are doing on the other side.  One time I was working with a company and GE offered us a billion dollars for the company. Yes, a BILLION.  They laid out the time frame. The deal will be closed by November 15 said the highest ranking person in the room from GE.  I went back to the CEO of the company I was advising and told him that.  He said, Who were you talking to? I told him.  He said, 100% chance this deal doesn't happen.  But they offered! I told him. They actually made an offer.  Trust me. No way. There's no real champion for you on the other side who is close to being a decision maker. She is 5 rungs below the decision maker and she's your only champion.  And he was right. That deal did not happen. They found a better way to get what they wanted for 1/200 of the price.  You can only cross the bridge to the other side if someone strong is there holding out their hand to pull you in.   I) THE DEAL IS NOT THE FINAL DEAL. DON'T RELAX!   People think when they agree on a deal, that's the end of the negotiation.  I'm sorry to say, that is only the beginning of the negotiation.  There's agreeing, there's signing, and there's closing.  The final two steps are equally important and everyone assumes they are easy.  They aren't. They are excruciatingly painful. The honeymoon period lasts for two days after you agree. Then there can be another six months to go.  Agreeing is easy. I'll buy your product or business for $X.  Signing a deal involves all the little things that are the nickels and dimes (see above).  Closing a deal means both sides delivering everything they represented in a deal.  At each stage of this is buyer's remorse and seller's remorse and often things have to be renegotiated.  So every day after agreement, make it a point to stay in touch, be friends, keep focusing on the vision (particularly with the champion for your deal on the other side), have just as much energy to close all the details, keep in touch with the lawyers to make sure paperwork is going through, keep working on the alternatives (since the negotiation is not done til it's DONE), and so on.  So many deals fall apart after agreement. You don't need this pain in your life.    LOVE IS A NEGOTIATION.   Taking another break here in the post. Please forgive me for not laying it out all perfect.  When I used to go on a first date I was both scared and excited. I'd get excited first, she wants to date me! And then I'd get scared. Ugh, what do I do now?  I'd literally do homework for the date. I'd find out her interests and read books on them. I'd watch comedy beforehand. I'd think of things to say and questions to ask. I'm not saying preparation is bad.  One time I was an expert on Kaballah. Another time I had to be an expert on Al Gore (long story). Another time I had to bribe the counter girl to pretend she knew me before my date arrived.  I'd be too scared to show my real self so I'd have to get her to like my fake self long enough for me to feel comfortable showing the real me.  Sometimes that never happened. In many cases I never had a real me. I was always jumping through hoops to keep the fake me going. I had to keep bribing the counter girl everytime we went for yogurt.  This is the difference between agreeing on a deal (the first date) and closing (trust, love, real compassion). This is a problem I'm afraid I will always have. I hope I am getting better bit by bit.    J) MOST DEALS DON'T WORK OUT.   You agree, you sign, you close, and STILL it's not the end.  Don't be the guy (or woman) who falls apart now that all the energy of the deal has been expended.  It's a negotiation and a deal because NOW there is work to do. There is a common vision to be achieved. There is a fantasy that must be made into reality.  Be that person. Be the one who delivers. You have a new baby in your hands as the result of this negotiation.  Now the hard work begins. Raise that baby to be a good adult.      Subscribe to the James Altucher Show Podcast here.       "
the six things the most productive people do every day,"    I admit I stole this title. But I didn't read the article. I didn't want to be tainted by the most productive people.  So I decided to write down what six things I do every day that help me with productivity. I think I'm somewhat productive. I help run a few businesses. I've written a book or two a year for the past 11 years. I speak a lot. I write articles. I've also had more than enough time to ruin a marriage, find a new marriage, lose a house, andother stuff.  But I also feel lazy a lot. Like, sometimes I'm tired so I take a nap in the middle of the day. Or sometimes I get writer's block. A lot of people say writer's block is a myth but I get it. Then I feel very unproductive.  About six years ago I would say I was 100% unproductive. Everything I did would cost me in either well-being or money. People say money isn't everything and they are right. But money helps you pay bills. I'm divorced with two kids so I have bills to pay.  So what is productive? Things that either increase my well-being: my feeling of growth or competence in a field I love (for instance, writing), my relationships with others, and my sense of freedom (which could (but not always) involve money).  Freedom can also come from needing less, so then you need less money.  Important to note that these three items of well-being are not goals. I will never be competent. A day is productive if I GROW in competence. If I grow in my relationships. If I grow in my feeling of choosing myself  my freedom to make my own decisions in life instead of catering to the decisions and tastes of others.  My six things (please help me and add to my list):   READING   Reading is maybe the most productive thing you can ever do. Here's what happens: when you die at the age of 100, you've just lived one 100 year life. When I read a book in a few days time, I just absorbed an entire life, curated, of someone I admire or respect.  It's like every book I read is a mentor. How many mentors do I have? 1000s. Thank god I have a podcast. Because after I read a good book I try to get the author on my podcast with the excuse that I want to give him or her more exposure. But the reality is I just want to ask questions like a little kid to someone I admire.   SLEEPING   I used to admire people who say, I only need 3 hours of sleep a day. Only later do I find out that most of these people are borderline mentally ill. Think about it the people in your life who say they only need 3 hours of sleep. I'm not going to accuse them of anything since I don't know them.  But be honest. Maybe they are a little..?  Why is sleeping productive? There's brain science about rejuvenating neurons, etc. I read that somewhere. There's all sorts of studies that people who sleep more get sick less, have more willpower, are less at risk for cancer, etc.  But there's something else.  Dan Ariely , a guest on my podcast, says that the brain's peak performance happens 2-4 hours after you wake up. Meaning: if you wake up at 5am, then from 7am to 9am, your brain is at it's most productive.  So here's what I do. I wake up at 5. I'll read (or take a walk), until 7am, and then I'll start writing. Writing is the activity I love most. I'm a little kid again when I write. So I want my brain to be at it's peak. So from 7  9am I'll write.  THEN, I do a trick. Many days (when I can) I'll take a 1-2 hour nap around 1 or 2 in the afternoon. Then I know that two hours later my brain AGAIN will be peaking. Maybe not as much as before. But enough. So I'll write again. This is why I do my Twitter Q&amp;As at 3:30 (every Thursday). Because I know my brain is supercharged then.  I know that if I do the activity I love most when my brain and body have the most energy then that will create the most value, create the most opportunities for me, improve my competence and improve my freedom (because of the opportunities generated).   EAT AT HOME   I don't like to eat out. It takes so long. And then you have to wait for the bill. And I always feel bloated and I hate salads in restaurants. So Claudia and I make simple meals (Claudia has been super inspired by  Rich Roll  and his wife Julia Platt so lately all the things we eat come from their book Plantpower) and we are done in about 10 minutes, two meals a day. So I probably save an hour or two by not eating out or not eating junk that will bloat me and make me less productive.   THROW STUFF OUT   A few months ago, Claudia and I threw out almost everything we owned. What do we really need? I like reading on the kindle. How many sheets do we need? We never have guests. How many clothes do I need? I was carrying around clothes I hadn't worn in forever.  Our house was totally empty. It was really nice. I felt like a breath of fresh air was going through my head. Einstein says (as an insult), if a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind, then what does an empty desk mean? I'm okay with that, Albert! I don't mind having an empty mind.  It makes room for new things, new connections between my memories, new things for me to enjoy. Less things to obsess on. Cleaning the outside and cleaning the inside reduce stress. Every day I try to throw things out. It makes me feel good. It also make me feel like I need less. Throwing things out tells my brain, you don't need this anymore so my brain stops wanting things.   NO NEWS   Someone asked me a few weeks ago to comment on the situation in Greece. Is Greece still a country? I had to look it up. I guess they are going to default on their debt. So what? This gives TV people something to argue about. I'm happy for them.  People are wired to notice lions much faster than they notice apple trees. That's why we are alive. Because our ancestors knew to RUN and the people who don't exist would have had ancestors who never ran.  Since there's no more lions chasing us down Main Street, the news tries to find other ways to trigger that fight or flight reflex.  I don't need to fight or flight in order to improve competence, improve relationships with people, or improve my freedom. So no TV. No news. No web surfing. No books about current events. No talking to people about current events. No conferences about what's going on in the world.   NO MEETINGS   I never went to a meeting where someone gave me a check at the end. I've never traveled to a meeting where it resulted in me making money or being happier.  Most meetings can be summarized in a two line email.  I'll go to a meeting if it's with my friends. That's fun and improves my relationships. But I never go to any other meetings.  What if you are an employee and you have to go to a meeting? Try to get out of it. Or go for part of it. Or insist you only go if there are no chairs at the meeting (meetings will be faster then). Or find a job where there's less meetings. Or show your boss there's evidence that company's with fewer meetings make more money.   NO PHONE   I talk on the phone maybe once every other day. Again, the two line email thing works in most cases.   EMAIL   I like Neil Strauss's approach. He has one hour a day scheduled for emails. His wife has his password so he can't even log on to email before that hour.  I don't email for an hour. My emails are mostly to readers with quick questions or to people I am inviting onto my podcast. I don't email anyone else.  I DO use texts though. Because they are faster. And I can text answers to people's questions in my spare time while riding a cab or waiting for my kids or whatever. My phone number is 203-512-2161. Sometimes I answer questions via text and sometimes on my podcast, Ask Altucher.  Again, if you're an employee somewhere you might be in the habit of responding quickly to email from, say, a boss. But try to cut it down to end-of-day when your brain is moving a bit slower and you don't need it as much.  ONLY do the thing you love most during your peak productive hours.  Hmmm, I just realized I gave eight ways to increase productivity. Since I've broken the rules (nothing wrong with that) I'll add a ninth.   EXPERIENCES   We're the sum of our experiences and not our material things. Experiences stay with us forever and build us into who we become. Material things get lost or thrown out or lose their usefulness.  A good experience for me is: where I meet friends, where I learn something new, where it's material I can write about. These experiences last with me forever and I carry them around in a little closet in my heart. If an experience doesn't belong there, then I don't do it.  What if you have to? Like if your brother or sister is getting married. Well, if it's in one of the categories above, then ok. But it's almost never in the categories above so I don't go.  What if your boss sends you to a conference.  Then I have a trick you can use. Instead of being depressed and saying, Ugh, I have to go to this conference I change I have to to I get to. Like, I get to meet a lot of new friends. And then I actively try to meet new friends.  I can't always do the above things. And then my gut reaction is saying Ugh, I have to. But If I always change I have to to I get to then I can usually turn the experience into something productive.  Today I have to take my kids to dance recital rehearsals.  But then I get to see them dance.     "
whats it like to lose 100000000 at facebook,"     Noah Kagan was fired as one of the first employees of Facebook and he left probably $100,000,000 behind if he had stayed. Then he was fired early on as an employee of Mint.com, which later got bought by Intuit.  SO I decided to call him.  I rarely leave my house so sometimes my only interactions are when I call strangers.  It did feel horrible, he told me, But I was arrogant. I deserved to be fired.  He told me more about what happened. Why he was fired. What he did afterwards. What he's doing now is genius. It made me feel bad again because I wish I had thought about. His company AppSumo is like a groupon for digital products.  He finds a digital product (an app, even a list of copywriting tips, a newsletter, whatever), negotiates a discount for a certain time period, and then sells it online to his 750,000 subscribers.  He describes all of this on my podcast .  But the podcast veered in a different direction THAT MAYBE CHANGED MY LIFE. We started talking about how to get out of the comfort zone.  Go to a coffee shop and ask for 10% off, he gave me the challenge. Order some stuff, it'll come to around $5, and then just say I would like 10% off please' .  Any coffee shop? I can't imagine a Starbucks would allow me.  Why do you think that?  Because they have rules.  Go to a Starbucks.  Right away I was thinking of all sorts of excuses. It should've been so easy to Ask but I couldn't.  I have a hard time asking people for things. Do you?  When I called Tim Ferriss and asked him if I could go on his podcast I was terrified. When I called the CEO of Twitter to ask him to write the foreword of my book, Choose Yourself! I was actually shaking and crying before I hit Send.  Many times in my life I have stopped myself from asking for things that I wanted.  I don't know what that says about me. I like to think of myself as never needing to Ask. Always being the king, the one who grants gifts. The giver.  So my mind started coming up with excuses about the coffee even though I was intent on following Noah's suggestion just to try it. If you try it, please report back here and tell me what happened.   I went the next town over because I didn't want people to know me (excuse number one).  If they knew me I didn't want them to feel obligated to say yes (excuse number two)  I didn't go to Starbucks because I thought their rules would be too strict (excuse number three)   I found a place that had just opened two weeks ago. Ordered coffee and a cookie (breaking paleo for this but they had nothing else). I was a bit nervous but I went into speaker mode where I'm not quite me. I'm more of a performer and the scared me is standing next to me.  The woman behind the counter said, $4.50  I said, Can I have 10% off? And then I was silent.  She just looked at me. Then she sort of blinked and shook. Like she was snapping out of it.  Wait a sec, she said, I don't think I understand what you said.  Can I have 10% off? So instead of $4.50 can I pay $4.10  She was smiling and was not mean about it but she said, Excuse me?  I'd like to pay $4.10 for this situation here.  She sort of laughed and said to an older guy who was washing the floor. Uhhh, Ray?  Ray came over. He must have been listening to the conversation because he said, That's certainly an unusual question.  At this point I could've used some sort of persuasion or given a reason but I just nodded my head and stayed silent.  He was looking at me almost as if he expected me to say something. He was smiling. I was attracted to the woman behind the counter so that was giving me a little bit of strength.  I'm going to have to say no' to that, he said.  Ok.  He walked away.  Well, the girl said, You tried.  I gave her 3 two dollar bills and told her to keep the change.  I had my coffee and didn't think much about it. But then when I left it sounds like a cliche but I literally felt the sunshine slightly burning my face. It was comforting. The air touching me.  There were three or four things I had been anxious over earlier (random problems of the day) that were not bothering me anymore. At least right then. And still right now.  Going outside the comfort zone put me in THE ZONE. THE ZONE is much bigger than the comfort zone. I want to live in the ZONE even though it's scarier.  When I got home I wrote Noah and told him what happened. I told him almost exactly the above.  He wrote back.  Congrats. But next time do it local. And next time do it at a Starbucks. The whole point is to get rejected as harshly as possible.  Maybe Noah just wanted to punish me but it didn't work. I did go to a Starbucks. I did get rejected. And my life has continued to change for the better.     "
self publishing your own book is the new business card,"     If you've just given someone your business card then you failed.  If you have a business card you might be about to fail. Nobody cares what's on it. I throw out all business cards.  I've written before about self-publishing but more than the why and how (although I add more info about this below than I previously have) this post is why  YOU NEED  to self-publish if you are in business, a blogger, a writer, or in any profession (essentially all professions) where you want to stand out versus the competition. There is one window, right now, where you have the right combination of easy to do, cheap, and nobody is doing it. The key is the Era of Validation is over.  Nobody needs to pick you.  You pick yourself.        I've published eight books in the past seven years, five with traditional publishers (Wiley, Penguin, HarperCollins), one comic book, and the last two I've self-published. In this post I give the specific details of all of my sales numbers and advances with the traditional publishers. Although the jury is still out on my self-published books, How to be the Luckiest Man Alive and   I Was Blind But Now I See  I can tell you these two have already sold more than my five books with traditional publishers, combined.  If you, the entrepreneur, self-publish a book you will stand out, you will make more money, you will kick your competitors right in the XX, and you will look amazingly cool at cocktail parties. I know this because I am seldom cool but at cocktail parties, with my very own comic book, I can basically have sex with anyone in the room. But don't believe me- it costs you nothing and almost no time to try it yourself.  The rest of this article is really three discussions: Why self-publish rather than use a traditional publisher, why entrepreneurs and others who seek to stand out for career or creatuve purposes should self-publish, and finally, HOW does one go about self-publishing.   WHY:    A) Advances are going to zero. Book publishers are getting more and more squeezed by declining booksellers so they, in turn, have to squeeze the writers. Because of so much free content on the Internet, the value per unit of content is going to zero unless you are already an established name-brand author.   B) Lag time. When you self-publish, you can have your book up and running on Amazon, paperback and kindle, within days. When you publish with a traditional publisher its a grueling process: book proposal, agents, lawyers, meetings, edits, packaging, catalogs, etc that ensures that your book doesn't actually get published until a year later. Literally, as I write this a friend of mine just IMed me the details of his book deal he just got with a mainstream publisher. Publication date: 2014.   C) Marketing. Publishers claim they do a lot of marketing for you. That's laughable. I'll give you a very specific story. When I published with Penguin they then met with a friend of mine whose book they wanted to publish. They didn't realize she was my friend. She asked them, what marketing did you do for James Altucher's book. They said, well, we got him a review in The Financial Times and we got a segment about his book on CNBC and an excerpt in thestreet.com  Here's what's so funny. I had a weekly column in The Financial Times. I WROTE my own review. As a joke. For CNBC, I had a weekly segment on CNBC. So naturally I spoke about my book during my regular segment. And for thestreet.com excerpt, I had just sold my last company to thestreet.com. So instead of doing my usual article for them I did an excerpt. In other words, the publisher did NOTHING, but took credit for EVERYTHING . Ultimately, authors (unless you are Stephen King, etc) have to do their own marketing for books. The first question publishers ask, even, before they look at your proposal is, How big is your platform? They want to know how you can market the book and if they can make money on just your own marketing efforts.        D) Better royalties . i.e. when I self-publish I make about a 70% royalty instead of a 15% royalty with a traditional publisher. I also own 100% of the foreign rights instead of 50%. I hired someone to sell the foreign rights and they get 20% (and no upfront fee).   E) More control over content and design. Look at this cover for SuperCash designed by a traditional publisher for me (this was my third book). It's hideous.  Now look at the cover for my last book (self-published),  I Was Blind But Now I See. You may or may not like it but it's exactly what I wanted. Publishers even include in the contract that they have final say over the cover and this is one detail they will not negotiate.  You also don't have any teenage interns sending you editorial comments back that you completely disagree with. YOU control your own content.       Now,   WHY SHOULD ENTREPRENEURS SELF-PUBLISH    A) You have content. I have enough material in my blog right now (including my Drafts folder which has 75 unpublished posts in it) to publish five more books over the next year. And I'm sure that number will increase over the next year as I write more posts. You're an entrepreneur because you feel you have a product or an idea or a vision that stands out among your competitors (if you don't stand out, pack it in and come up with a new idea).  You know how to do something better than anyone else in the world. How do let the world know that you are better? A business card won't cut it. People will throw it away. And everyone's got a website with an About button.  Give away part (or all) of your ideas in a book. You're a brand new social media agency? How should social media work? Write it down. You're a new CRM software package? How should CRM be better? Tell me. How should online dating services work? Tell some stories. Heck, make them as sexy as possible.  Don't have time to write it. Then tell it to a ghostwriter you outsource to for almost no money. You don't need 60,000 words. Do it in 20,000 words. Throw some pictures in. Just do it. Then when you meet someone and they ask for your business card, how cool will it be when you can say, here, take my book instead.   B) You have more to say. More and more companies have blogs. Many of the posts on the blog are evergreen. i.e. they last forever and are not time specific. If you just take the posts (mentioned in the point above) and publish them people will say, he's just publishing a collection of posts. A couple of comments on that.   1. So what? It's ok if you are curating what you feel your best posts are. And for a small price people can get that curation and read it in a different format.There's value there.   2. Don't just take a collection of your posts. A blog post is typically 500-2000 words. Usually closer to 500. Do a bit more research for each post. Do intros and outros for each post. Make the chapters 3000-4000 words. Make a bigger arc to the book by using original material to explain WHY this book, with these chapters, presented in this manner is a different read than the blog. Have a chapter specifically explaining how the book is different from the blog.  With my last book,  I Was Blind But Now I See   I had original material in each chapter and several chapters that were completely original. Instead of it being a collection of posts, the overall book was about how we have been brainwashed in society, and how uncovering the brainwashing and using the techniques I describe can bring happiness. This was covered in a much more detailed fashion than the blog ever could even though the material was inspired by several of my posts.   C) Amazon is an extra platform for you to market your blog. Or vice versa. You won't make a million dollars on your book (well, maybe you will  never say never) but just being able to say, I'm a published author extends your credibility as a writer/speaker/enterpreneur when you go out there now to sell your book, syndicate your blog elsewhere or to get speaking engagements, etc. And when you do a speaking engagement, you can now hand something out  your book! So Amazon and publishing become a powerful marketing platform for your overall writing/speaking/consulting career.   D) Nobody cares. Some people want the credibility of saying Penguin published me. I can tell you from experience  nobody ever asked me who was my publisher when Penguin was my publisher. And, by the way, Penguin was the worst publisher I ever had.   E) How will I get in bookstores? I don't know. How will you? Traditional publishers can't get you there either. Often bookstores will look at what's hot on Amazon and then order the books wholesale from the publishers. In many cases, tradtional publishers will take their most-known writers (so if you are in that category, congrats!) and pay to have them featured at a bookstore. As for my experience, my traditional publishers would get a few copies of my books in the bookstores of major cities (i.e. NYC and that's it) but nothing more.   OK, I'M CONVINCED. HOW DO I SELF-PUBLISH   There's lots of ways to do it but I'll tell you my experience.   A) First write the book. For my last two self-published books, as mentioned above, I took some blog posts, rewrote parts of them, added original material, added new chapters, and provided an overall arc as to what the BOOK was about as opposed to it just being a random collection of posts. But, that said, you probably already have the basic material already.   B) Createspace.com. I used createspace because they are owned by Amazon and have excellent customer service. They let you pick the size of your book and then have Microsoft Word templates that you download to format your book within. For my first book I did this by myself, for my second book, for a small fee, I hired Alexanderbecker.net to format the book, create the book design, and create the final PDF that I uploaded. He also checked grammar, made proactive suggestions on font (sans serif instead of serif) and was extremely helpful.   C) Upload the PDF. Createspace approves it, picks an ISBN number, sends you a proof, and then you approve the proof.   D) Within days its available on Amazon. It's print-on-demand as a paperback. And by the way, your total costs at this point: $0. Or whatever you used to design your cover.   E) Kindle. All of the above (from Createspace) was free. If I didn't hire Alex to make the cover I could've used over 1mm of Createspace's possible covers (I did that for my first book) and the entire publishing in paperback would be free. But with Kindle, Createspace charges $70 and they take care of everything until it's uploaded to the Kindle store. Now you are available in paperback and kindle.   F) Marketing.   1. Readers of my blog who asked for it got the first 20 copies or so for free from me. Many of them then posted good reviews on Amazon to get the ball rolling.  2. I've been handing out the books at speaking engagements. Altogether, I'll do around 10 speaking engagements handing my latest book out.  3. I write a blog post about how the bo0k is different from the blog and why I chose to go this route.  4. Writing guests posts for blogs like Techcrunch helps and I'm very grateful.  5. Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, Google+ are also very helpful.   G) Promotions . You're in charge of your own promotions (as opposed to a book publisher.). For instance,  in a recent blog post I discussed the differences between my latest book and my blog and I also offered a promotion on how to get my next self-published book (Bad Behavior, expected in Q1 2012) for free.  Entrepreneurs are always looking for ways to stand out, promote their service, and get validation for their offerings. Writing a book makes you an expert in the field. At the very least, when you hand someone a book you wrote, it's more impressive than handing a business card. It shows that you have enough expertise to write the book. It also shows you value the relationship with the potential customer enough that you are willing to give him something of value. Something you created.  And you can't say the excuse I don't have time, I'm running a business. Entrepreneurs make time. And they have the ideas so, again, at the very least you can use elance.com to hire a ghostwriter.  Over the next year I have five different books planned. All on different topics. I'm super-excited about them because I'm allowed to push the barrier in every area I'm interested in and there's nobody to stop me. There's nobody I need validation from. I get to pick myself.  You can do this also. And now, you should do it. There's no more excuses in this environment. Good luck and feel free to write me with any questions.

10 things i learned while interviewing tony robbins about his new book money,"   [Here is the link to the podcast: http://bit.ly/1t8RJ80 ]     When we got to Tony Robbins' house we were specifically prevented from photographing his sneakers. I took out the camera but his assistant shook her head. No. Which made me feverishto take the picture even more but I didn't.    Everyone takes their shoes off. And all the other shoes were like normal human shoes. Then there were his sneakers.    My business partner called me after we did our amajor deal in 2004. I was about to go broke when we did this deal but we did it and it saved my life. My partnersaid, you'll never guess what number I wrote down in 2001 after we both read Awaken the Giant Within  and of course I guessed correctly. It was the number we made in 2004.    In 2001 he was ashamed to tell me. Guess who I am reading. And then we realized we were reading the same books. Both of Tony Robbins books. But they were written so long ago I kept going to the bookstore thinking Tony Robbins was going to have a new book out any day.    Now Tony Robbins has a new book out today. For the first time in 25 years I think.    Bill Clinton is the first blurb on the inside of his book (I ask him about that in his interview: Why does Bill Clinton even call you? What do you guys talk about?)    So I was really excited to fly down to his house in Florida and interview him a few weeks ago.It was like going down to visit a member of the X-Men.    Claudia and I got to his house and his staff helped us set up our equipment and then we took a walk out to the ocean. It was beautiful. We felt lucky and relaxed.    Then we went back inside. I told Claudia to start the recording before Tony even showed up. So we could pick up all idle chit chat. When Tony arrived we started talking and he said, this is good. We should record this and then he laughed when Claudia saidwe were already recording.    The book is called Money a topic I sometimes know a lot about and sometimes know nothing about. I ran hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, and have advised many money managers, often people managing billions of dollars.    Tony took it one step further and interviewed the top money managers in the world, how they do what they do.He exposed many of the scams still on Wall Street. He gives simple advice that everyone can follow.    We spoke for an hour. Here's what I learned from the book and from talking to him. I'm mostly going to leave out the financial stuff. All of that is in the book: the scams, the ways to avoid them, the interviews with the amazing people he spoke with.    Here's what I personally learned.     A) ASK LOUSY QUESTIONS, GET LOUSY ANSWERS.     Many people say, Why did this have to happen to me? Or Why did I lose that job when I was good?    These are lousy questions. You will never get an answer that makes your life better. I get bitter, resentful, angry. And anger is a form of fear. I'm usually afraid I'm going to go broke. And if I go broke, I'm afraid I die.    You have to ask good questions: What can I do to improve? or How can I find a better job? or How can I be grateful that I lost this job?    Because inside of every problem is the seeds of a difficult gratitude problem and it always improves your life to solve those problems.     B) TO MASTER ANYTHING, TALK TO THE EXPERTS.     Tony told us about a time when he was 24 years old and he wanted to train members of the military to shoot better.    I had never shot a gun in my life, he said and laughed in his raspy voice. He was scared he wouldn't do a good job.    So how did he solve this problem? He spoke to five excellent sharpshooters, figured out what they all had in common, and then used that to increase the results of the students in the school by 50%.     C) BRING THE TARGET CLOSER.     Specifically, for every student he had them bring the target only a few feet away. Everyone shot bullseyes. Then he moved the target back a foot. Bullseyes. Then another foot. And so on.    This is true for everything in life. I look at the example Mark Cuban told me. He didn't just start Broadcast.com and make a billion. First he started a bar. Then he started a computer business. Then a hedge fund.    He brought the target very close and then moved it further and further away as he succeeded at each thing.    I thought about teaching my 12 year old how to serve in tennis. First I had her serve from the net. All you have to do is hit the ball into this huge box. Then when she got 10 in a row I had her move back a few feet until she hit the base line. Now she's got the most consistent server on her team (I'm bragging).     D) LOOK AT GOALS DIFFERENTLY.     Tony told us of one time he asked people what their goals were. One guy said, I want to make a billion dollars! At first this would seem like an admirable goal  set it high! There's thathorrible saying, Aim for the moon, because even if you miss it you'll find yourself among the stars.    But Tony said, this guy didn't really understand his goal.    He broke it down. Why do you want a billion? And the first answer was, I want my own plane. Tony told him, Well a plane costs $100 million and you might only be flying 12 times a year. If you charter a yet for $30,000 an hour then it will take you forever to spend $100 million. So suddenly the guy didn't need $1 billion anymore. He needed $900 million.    By the end of that session, Tony said, it turns out to achieve the exact lifestyle he thought he needed a billion for, he needed $10 million. This is still a lot of money but this was Tony's way of bringing the target closer.    When I read that in his book, I did the exercise with Claudia. Her numbers went down by 90% when we really went through it. What happens then? You feel relief. You don't have to be on the hamster wheel of money for your whole life. What you want is freedom, not money.     E) EXPERTS KNOW THEY KNOW NOTHING.     All the time I get spam financial newsletters saying, The Markets are going to zero! or This stock is going to go up 1000%! The reality is the experts know zero. With every investment expert that Tony interviewed they not only had a plan B. They had a plan C, D, and E.    The best professionals in the business admit they know nothing.    Nobody can predict the future. Anything can happen. When I got out of the futurebusiness I was much happier. I got into the possibility business.    This made me a lot more successful. Leave the future business for the possibility business and the world will get infinitely larger.     F) HIS ENERGY IS INFECTIOUS.     Somebody told me he jumps up and down on a trampoline before speaking in front of 10,000 people. He wants his energy at peak.    I thought about doing that before my most recent TED talk but there was no trampoline available. But it's true. When he came downstairs to talk to us he was very excited about the potential for his book to help people. It almost made me want to write about financial stuff again.    After Claudia and I left his house (and, by the way, that's a BIG house) we had so many ideas about creative things we could do we almost had to pull over and calm down. So we went to Cheesecake Factory and ate until we exploded.     G) THE TONY ROBBINS METHOD.     In the interview I said, Ok, I figured it out. You use the Tony Robbins Method'. Which I defined as,    at first you don't know anything.  you find 5 people who are the experts in the world.  you extensively interview them.  you figure out the most simple things they have in common with each other.  you do that simple thing over and over and over and over (repetition).    And that's how you succeed.     H) PEOPLE NEED CERTAINTY. PEOPLE NEED VARIETY.     Everyone needs to know where their next meal is coming from. And maybe their next kiss. And maybe a bunch of things. We crave some stability, which was the appeal of corporate jobs for the past 100 years (although that period is now slowly coming to an end) and was the appeal of all these mutual fund ads that say, we return 9% a year.    But most of that stability is a lie. You have to find stability inside yourself first.    For me, it's stable to make money from multiple sources. To know that if I have ideas every day, then life will be more stable than if I don't.    But we also need variety. A marriage will die if you stick to the same routine year after year (the 7 year itch). A job will get boring. We only have one life. It doesn't mean you quit your marriage or quit your job. But always look for new things to learn. Always look for new ways to surprise. Always look for new ways to break out of your comfort zone.    It's this dance of certainty and uncertainty that made us human and we often lean too much in one way or the other. But if you did that on the dance floor you'd fall over.    Tony describes this in the book in a financial sense. His goal is to expose the lies in the financial community and get you thinking about how to provide stability there so you can find variety in other parts of your life.     I) SHOW PEOPLE YOU ARE GRATEFUL.     When we are very young we build strong neural circuits across our brains so that electricity can pass quickly between certain neurons. This is why it's easier to learn when we are young then when we are older.    After the age of 20, we lose the ability to insulate these neural circuits with myelin, the substance which cements these circuits for life. This is where our basic intelligence comes from. Building as many circuits as possible with myelin protecting them.    I think the same thing happens with relationships. Business, personal, family relationships, etc. They start off young and that's when you can build almost a relationship myelin around them. You do that by being honest with people, by showing gratitude, by not overusing the connection, by treating it just right so it develops into something that can last a lifetime.    If someone does something for you, show you are grateful.     J) BE THE SERVANT OF MANY.     Tony said in the interview exactly how much he saved in taxes by moving from California to Florida. It was a big number. He had a big house. He's spoken in front of three million people. He's feeding 50 million people. This is a process that took him 30 years or more.    He said the way he did it was by being the servant of many. By constantly adding value to others, you get value come back to you. It becomes the most natural thing.    Tony Robbins has his critics I am sure. But I know he has helped me get through a hard time 13 years ago, maybe even saving my life. I know he has helped others. People always seem to be afraid to admit it.I know I almost feel ashamed to say I needed help.    But it's by helping others and accepting help that we grow as a society. Sometimes people think choosing myself is a selfish concept. But it's the only way you build the strength to help others. It's the only way you surrender to not some man-made force, but a force inside yourself that is perhaps the most powerful there is.    Claudia and I left his house and drove around and around talking about what the interview meant to us. And I guess we still are.    [Here is the link to the podcast: http://bit.ly/1t8RJ80 ]      "
nothing is wrong with you,"        Gabi Uri is missing muscles in her calves and her abs plus she has scoliosis. She's 16 and has had this condition since birth. Since she was born she's had 14 surgeries to help correct her condition as much as possible. She walks with a slight limp.      I mention that to set the stage. But first, Google plank. It's sort of like a pushup position but your elbows are also on the ground.  How long can you hold the plank position? Try right now. I'm going to try it. Hold on.  Ok, it took me about 45 seconds before I realized this was a nightmare. And then around the two minute mark I stopped.  You realize when you are doing it that you pretty much need the muscles in your abs and calves.  So here's the point: in April, Gabi Ury held herself in this position for over an hour and 20 minutes and broke the world record for females holding the plank position.  She spoke before me at a conference last week. I didn't listen to her talk because it was right before my talk and I was scared to death.  While she was talking I watched Louis CK do standup and I did my trick where I picture the anxious part of me split off from me and stand to the side. Then I waited for Gabi to finish.  When she finished, someone was introducing me so I still had a few seconds.  She walked right into the arms of her father. She hugged him as tightly as possible. I can't get the image out of my head. Her whole life he's been there for her.  She broke the world record because someone loved her that much. Because many people were kind to her. Because he cared. Because she cared.  Persistent kindness is heaven. I hope I can be kind all my life.  Her face was buried into his chest and she held onto him for life. He was looking down at her and smiling and he hugged her back. It's hard at 16 to give a talk to 1300 people. To bleed on the stage. To make people cry and smile at the same time.  I kept watching them hug.  I didn't listen to the person introducing me until someone said in my ear, Ok. Go!' And I was supposed to walk onto the stage.  But it's rare when you can pull such a love out of this harsh and chaotic universe. I stood there a few more seconds and watched Gabi hug her father.  Her father, by coincidence, has written a book called Getting to Yes. Similar title to the book Claudia and I just wrote, The Power of No. Someone said to me that it was similar themes.  I do remember the last thing Gabi said before she got off stage. The final moments of her talk.  She said: Sometimes people ask me, What's wrong with you?  She said: And I reply, Nothing is wrong with me'   Hug.     "
who is in your scene,"       (Jasper Johns's Flag. A product of his scene)  Claudia asked me, What took you the longest in your life to understand?  I don't know if I understand anything in my life. I don't say this with self-modesty. Every day I learn something where I say to myself, why didn't I learn that before?  But I know the answer to Claudia's question: it took me the longest to understand that our ability to survive, to be calm, to even be happy, to possibly be successful, stems entirely from the quality of the people you surround yourself with.  Surround yourself with creative, smart, good, honest people and good things will happen. You are your scene.  Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William Burroughs went to Columbia together (not sure if Burroughs did but he hung out there).  Ginsberg got into publishing and helped Kerouac get On the Road published which became the bible for 22 year old kids everywhere.  When Burroughs was sick from drugs in Morocco and Ginsberg was visiting him he found random scraps of writing all over the floor of Burroughs place. He pieced them together (barely), edited them (barely), and got it published as the now-classic (ugh, I hate it) Naked Lunch.  Together, the three of them consistently helped their friends get books published, art sold, poetry read, and on and on.  And even though their styles were totally different they created one movement that every writer at the time wanted to be a part of, The Beat Movement.  Around the same time, the painter Jasper Johns lived with the artist Robert Rauschenberg and they hung out with the dancer Merce Cunningham and the composer John Cage.  Eventually they all met Leo Castelli who sold their works for millions. When they all first met, all of them were complete unknowns.  In Silicon Valley: Facebook, Palantir, Youtube, Tesla, LinkedIn, Yelp, Yammer, and more were all either largely funded or started by ex-employees of PayPal.  As I pointed out in another post: HBO, Showtime, Viacom, Starz, FX, Universal, and shows like Mad Men, House of Cards, etc were all started by a core group of people who worked together at the same time at HBO.  If you watch interviews with comedians like Louis CK, Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David, Chris Rock, they all worked together in no-name clubs for years, each opening for the other over and over again, until they broke out one by one and pulled their talented friends along with them.  Back in 2008-9, I had spent eight years building my scene in the financial space and I was realizing that it was just not working for me. I had failed to build a scene. I felt really lonely and scared.  Either none of these people really liked me, or they thought me a failure or I didn't like them or I don't know what. It wasn't working out.  I was getting kicked off boards, losing all of my writing gigs, losing all of my TV gigs, failing at opportunities, and this was eeking into every area of my life: getting divorced, losing a home, going broke.  I kept hearing about people talking behind my back. Whatever. It doesn't matter. It was the wrong scene for me. Blech.  Instead of making me feel creative and innovative I just kept feeling worse and worse. When people with positive energy are around each other, more energy is created.  More art is created. More innovation with more integrity with more opportunities. You literally can eat less if you are around people who are giving you energy and bringing you to a higher level.  So I started to blog. I figured I had nothing to lose. And nothing really to gain. I didn't know what scene I was in. I just wanted to return to what I loved 20 years earlier: writing.  I moved 70 miles north of the city just to escape my old scene and now I had nothing and was getting ready to go broke again after starting and selling many businesses and then constantly failing.  And then bit by bit I met amazing people. Other people from around the country or world doing what I was doing.  People would send me a note. Or call me with some ideas. Or promote my work. Or make an introduction. And I would do the same. We'd all like each other's stuff. We'd all take time out from our own work to help each other.  I've now flown all over the country meeting these people, learning from them, really creating new opportunities for myself and for them. Everyone helping everyone where we can, if we can, in the only ways we can.  I felt bad I had no Scene in 2009. But that doesn't matter. When you do something you love, or even just something you'regood at (you will learn to love what you are good at) or even something you do with authenticity and integrity (because then you become the trusted source of a scene) then people will gravitate towards you.  How do you monetize a Scene? It will happen. Every single person I've met who I consider part of my Scene now has offered me opportunities to make money.  Some I've taken, some I haven't but we worked together in other ways (there are many, many ways people can support and help each other).  Artists and entrepreneurs never work by themselves. There's always a context. There's always others from around the world that you can trade ideas with and build ideas on each other.  And if you think you aren't a creator, then I'm not going to believe you. We all have our secret passions in the desk drawer. We all can find our way to the people who inspire us. The people we admire and want to emulate and want to help.  And then it becomes fun. It's two kids building a city out of wooden blocks, not caring about what happened before or what will happen later. Let's just build the coolest stuff with our blocks. Let's make it bigger and bigger. And more and more colorful. And if all the blocks fall we can laugh and start again.  A few months ago I went to Seattle and I HATE to travel. I was meeting with one of the people I consider in my Scene. I've known him now for almost four years.  We've since hung out in sixdifferent cities going to different conferences, meetings, etc. We've written books and each supported the other's books with ideas and inspiration. Plus helped each other in businesses and helped other people in our Scene.  A few months ago he had made an introduction, then I had written down some ideas, then we got an invitation, and then we went to visit Amazon. To do what?  Who knows?We went! Fun things happened. The dots might connect more in the future. Building a scene mixes up past, present, and future to create a life of reward.  How do you build a scene:   find the people whose work inspires you. Businesses, writings, art, whatever.  come up with ideas for them. How can you help them?  start doing your own work. Share with the people you like. Interact with the people who interact with you sincerely.  try to meet the people who inspire you. Some of them are busy. Some would like to meet.  go to conferences and meet the people who inspire you.  every day work. Every day create. Every day share. The people you share with slowly solidify into your Scene.  And thenrepeat. Never stop helping.   Never stop building each other up. Never stop making introductions (with permission from each side before you make an intro).  Never stop delivering value into the Scene. The more powerful the Scene, the more likely it is you will have fun doing what you do, make money at it, succeed at it, live off of it, love it, and make friends.  Today I'm going on two other people's podcasts. Two new people in my scene.  Together, I hope we create something amazing.     "
10 things i learn from richard branson,"         The other day  I  went out at night and fell asleep on a park bench near the beach in Miami.  When  I  opened my eyes  I  pretended  I  had just landed on the world.  I  knew nothing. Now  I  had to learn everything.  That's the way  I  should've been when  I  was younger. Maybe  I  would've avoided many problems if  I  just realized  I  knew nothing.  ALL SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE started off knowing nothing.  They studied the people who came before them. Who studied the people who came before them. And so on.   I  really admire  Richard   Branson . He's one to study.   Richard   Branson  is the perfect example of Ready. Fire. Aim. He starts something. He does it. Then he looks to see if he hit the target. If not, he starts something new.   I  love the story of how he started Virgin Airlines. He was already successful  from  Virgin Music. Note that now he has nothing to do with Virgin Music.   I  don't even know if Virgin Music still exists. All that is left is Virgin Air.  A plane had gotten cancelled. Everyone was upset.  But  Branson  wasn't upset. He found a plane that would take him. But he didn't have the money.  One good thing to start with always is to imagine the obstacles gone. Imagine, if  I wasn't worried about money, would  I  still make this trip?   I  call this IDEA SUBTRACTION. Subtract the perceived obstacles to an idea and (BAM!) you find that many more ideas are born  from  that.  First, he arranged to rent the private plane, even though he still had the obstacle (no money).  Then he put up a sign: $29 for a plane to Puerto Rico. And everyone signed up. Suddenly he had the money for the plane.  That was his proof-of-concept for an airline. Now that is his main business and it's worth billions.  Here's ten quotes  from  him that  I  think are valuable.   1.  Richard   Branson : Listen more than you talk. Nobody  learned  anything by hearing themselves speak.    2.  Richard   Branson : Start making suggestions for how to improve your workplace. Don't be a shrinking violet, quietly getting your job done adequately. Be bold, and the sky is the limit.   Note he's not suggesting start a company. You can always create inside ANY surrounding and you will be infinitely rewarded for that.  The first employee at Google is now a multi-billionaire even though nobody knows his name (Craig Silverstein). He was an employee and he created and blossomed.          3.  Richard   Branson : Age isn't as important so long as you are surrounded by people you love, doing  things  you passionately believe in.    I  truly believe this. We all have  things  we love to do. And it's the people around us who love us that help us unlock these dreams.  It's ONLY when you find the people you love, you can create and flourish. Henry Ford was 45 when he started his third car company and created the assembly line. He did this once he eliminated all the people who tried to control him at prior companies.  Colonel Sanders was 65 when he started Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Laura Ingalls Wilder was 65 when she wrote her first book. The book that would turn into the series, Little House on the Prairie.  This was after she had been totally wiped out in the Great Depression and left with nothing but she started to surround herself with people who encouraged her and pushed her to pursue writing to make ends meet.   4.  Richard   Branson : What  I  personally know would make up a dot so minuscule it couldn't be seen. What humanity has collectively  learned  so far would make up a tiny mark within the circle. Everything we all have to learn in the future would take up the rest of the space. It is a big universe, and we are all learning more about it every day. If you aren't listening, you are missing out.   The other day someone asked me if  I  believed in God. There's no answer. Always have reverence for the infinite  things  we will never know. Our brains are too small.  This next quote  I  slightly want to change:   5.  Richard   Branson : To be a real entrepreneur you always have to be looking forward. The moment you rest on your laurels is the moment your competition overtakes you.    I  think entrepreneur' can be changed to human'. We all have to survive and succeed first as humans. And the job description changes every day.  Every day there is room to finish this sculpture that began the moment our mothers released us into the world.          6.  Richard   Branson : There is no such thing as a boring person: everyone has stories and insights worth sharing. While on the road, we let our phones or laptops take up our attention. By doing that, we might miss out on the chance to learn and absorb ideas and inspiration  from  an unexpected source: our fellow travelers.   Every day has stories hidden inside of them, like a treasure hunt. When you find those stories, you get rewarded. Not by money, but by I  don't know. Something. You feel it when it happens.   7.  Richard   Branson : It can be easy to find reasons not to do something. However you might be surprised by how much help is at hand if you put yourself out there and commit to a project. It doesn't have to be a case of struggling along by yourself.   We live in a world of connection. The barriers we've erected by storytelling (religion, nationalism, corporatism) are breaking down.  You can crowdsource a revolution with a single tweet now. There are a million ways to ask for help and a million people who want to help you.  But it's hard to ask. There's the old fears of rejection. Fears of people viewing asking as weakness. Fears of infringing on someone by asking.  Offer value in your ask and then the reasons to not do something start to go away until there are none left.  And again,  Branson  is referring to idea subtraction which has constantly propelled him  from  success to success.   8.  Richard   Branson : When most people think about taking a risk they associate it with negative connotations, when really they should view it as a positive opportunity. Believe in yourself and back yourself to come out on top. Whether that means studying a course to enable a change of direction, taking up an entry level position on a career ladder you want to be a part of, or starting your own business  you'll never know if you don't give it a try.   Another example of how  Branson  would use idea subtraction to come up with tons of ideas.  For instance, sometimes people say, If only  I  knew how to program  I  could do X. Well, imagine you could program. Subtract that worry. Now what ideas would you implement?  You can always subtract a worry. Whether it's putting up a sign ($29 to get to Puerto Rico) or, as  Branson  suggests above, taking an entry level position.  When  I  started my first successful company my job title was, Jr. Programmer Analyst at HBO and  I  had $0 in the bank.   I  took an entry level job so  I  could move to NYC and start making connections.  I  stayed at that job for three years while building my network.  For more than half of those three years  I  had my first company on the side, building up.   I  was afraid all the time  I  would get caught doing two jobs at the same time.  But  I  did learn that these almost insurmountable obstacles were the EXACT reason  I had huge opportunities.  When people think a problem is impossible they value it at zero. Successful people buy ideas low (zero) and sell them high.  You ask why can't  I ? as in the following quote  from   Branson :   9.  Richard   Branson :  I 've always had a soft spot for dreamers  not those who waste their time thinking what if' but the ones who look to the sky and say why can't  I  shoot for the moon?'   oes he really mean the moon here? Or does that sound cliche? Let's look.  When  Branson  was a teenager and started his first magazine devoted to music,  I  doubt he was thinking about shooting for the moon.  But who knows? Now his biggest investment is Virgin Galactic. That magazine (which he started despite severe dyslexia) literally turned into a company that is now shooting to land a ship on the moon.  Why not? Why not?           10 .  Richard   Branson : Together we can make the products, services, businesses, ideas, and politics for a better future. In this new power' world, we are all makers. Let's get making.   Sometimes people write me and say, not everyone is cut out to be an entrepreneur. Some people like being employees.   I  agree with this. There is nothing wrong with being an employee. It's what you make of it.   I ve been an employee many times. The key is to realize that an employee doesn't mean you give up on creating, on making, on coming up with ideas.  In fact, an employee often has more opportunity for abundance than an entrepreneur. The playing field is much larger in a big corporation where everything is possible.   I  went to graduate school with Astro Teller, who was recently on my podcast. He runs the special projects division at Google called GoogleX. He's an employee at Google.  He was asked to dream at Google and now Google, a software company, is making driverless cars. It seems insurmountable: What if we can make a car without a driver? But that's where the opportunity is.  Every day  I  wake up and it's a constant battle in my brain against obstacles. Usually not business obstacles but emotional ones. Fears. People. Ideas. Hopes. This is life. A stream of obstacles and fears in a tough world.   I  wish  I  had paid attention to the many wonderful virtual mentors, the  Richard  Bransons of the world, when  I  was younger.  To simply admit,  I  don't know and reap the benefits of curiosity.   I  hope  I  learn something today. If not  I ll go back and reread these quotes and maybe sleep on a park bench.     "
ten scams you encounter every day,"    I distinctly remembered we all threw our bodies on top of each other. We were making a mountain of bodies. We were all laughing and wrestling to see who would get to the top of the bodies. I was on top. I was three or four years old. We were in Yellow Duck Nursery School. Laughing. Having fun.  Then I took a shit. A big one.  And we were all in shorts. Something I like to describe on CNBC as the trickle-down effect began to occur.  Everyone started yelling. Everyone started insulting me and running away from me. A teacher hit me. The next memory I have was that I was on the special kids school bus in the middle of the day. My mom was waiting on the driveway. What did you do! she said and took me by the hand and brought me inside.    (safe for work!)   That may have been my first memory.  What we do with our bowels is very important to us. We basically viscerally remember the times we shit on others. The more people under us, the bigger the memory.  The government, the media, the advertising industry, society, culture, your bosses, your parents, continue this trickle down-effect.   BONUS SCAM: Trading stocks is a totally rigged scam.  Anybody who doesn't listen to me is just jerking off in a madhouse. I have so much proof the system is completely rigged that the only way to win is if you are on the side of the people doing the rigging. There are 300mm people in the country and probably about 200 people who are rigging the system. Good luck trying to fit yourself into the club of 200 while you lose all of your money.  Here's other scams which involves groups of people doing massive poops on others (ok, I toned down the language):   A) Advertising.  I spoke to a guy who used to run a TV network. He said,I would never in a million years buy a TV ad. They are useless. I repeat: He RAN a TV network. His whole job was to sell ads to all the losers who would listen to his lies. All advertising is like that. We've evolved into an age where content creates branding. If you don't stand out through valuable content, you're useless. Advertising seems like a small scam. Does it equal the level of these other scams? And yet, we're exposed to something like 10,000 impressions of ads per day. And the companies that pay for those ads are even being scammed because they don't have people who understand the value of creating real content.      Now we're fooled into thinking that personal branding is important.  When people talk to me about personal branding the first thing I think is,  ok, so you're a liar.  Why do I need a personal brand? Why should that be any different than the honest me? Are people afraid to show their real selves (rhetorical question because the obvious answer is yes).      B) Housing . I've said it in a million articles so I'll be concise here as to  why it's a scam:  Banks borrow from the people with checking accounts. They pay 0.5% or whatever. That's a loan you give the bank and you can call it back anytime you want by writing a check or withdrawing the money. They then take that money and lend it out at 6% to people who want to buy a house. The multi-trillion dollar banking industry makes almost all of its money that way.  Multi-TRILLION.  So they have to keep making you think that you don't have roots (a Neanderthal call back to our Mother Earth mysticism) unless you own a white picket fence, a house that can't be moved, a home for your children, etc. Trillions of dollars are at stake if you don't believe in this scam. For all the other reasons, check out my articles. [See the most popular article every on this blog:  Why I'd Rather Shoot Myself In the Head than Ever Own a Home Again   actually, that article links to the most popular article because it's a response to a response of the original article]   C) Education.  I know, I know,  I've written about this  a million times. But think about it: why is it that just about everything single thing you learned in history class has to be relearned when you are an adult just so you get the reality of what happened. And when I was growing up we somehow ran out of time to learn about the Vietnam War. Surprise. The reality is, society needs your parents to work. So what the hell are they going to do with you? Well, they really should just let you play in the mud all day. But municipalities justify exorbitant taxes by saying, no,no, no, that's illegal! They have to go to school and get tested and standardized and we will love them from nine to three so you don't need to feel guilty.   D) Happiness.  The entire modern concept of happiness was  re-created  with commercial images to fool you in various ways. So that people can advertise to you (if you buy this, you'll be happier than if you buy that), so that companies can convince you to work (if you make this amount of money and we treat you vaguely nicely then you will be happy). So that self-help gurus can sell you everything from food to exercises to positive thinking to make you think you will be a little bit happier. I do think there is such a thing as happiness but it takes a very different form than the one usually shown at surprise birthday parties.   E) Politics . We get so worked up. When Obama won the election a friend of mine told me she felt something akin to an orgasm. And now what? Where's the next orgasm? Will she have another orgasm at the next election? Is she going to have an orgasm for Rick Perry this time? Nothing wrong with Obama. It's just that the President doesn't do anything and we no longer even need a Congress. But billions of dollars are made on lobbying, political advertising, consulting, etc to get your hopes up. [See,  Time to Abolish the Presidency , which links to my other articles on why politics is a scam.]    (Barack Gaga - the most beautiful creature on the planet)    F) News.  I once visited with a news producer while he was producing his show. On the news that night there were elections, earthquakes, wars, economics, smart pundits (e.g. me), etc. All things to scare the hell out of you. In the middle of the show the producer told me,  100% of our job is filling up the spaces in between advertisements.  So here I had it: a guy whose entire job is to create the primetime news for YOU was telling me it was a scam. That's the news. Tell me a single thing you saw on the news today that was either not a lie or was in some way relevant to your life.   G) The Middle Man.  There are lots of people in the middle trying to separate you from happiness. They are greedy and want the happiness for themselves because they foolishly think there is a finite amount of it. Venture Capitalists separating investors from their money and giving it to young entrepreneurs. Agents (literary, movie, etc). Real estate agents. Gurus (the middle man between God/happiness and you). Lawyers (the middle men between an overly complex legal system and you when most documents are just printed off the printer in five seconds, your name filled in, and then they charge you $10,000). Doctors (the middle man between  the FDA  (which controls all prescriptions and is, itself, a horrible scam) and sick people who need the medicine). Damn, I should've saved this one for an entire post.   H) Money.  All of the markets are a scam. Stocks, gold, oil, the debt of every country, our currencies. The scam is so large it could take centuries to unravel. People spend their lives trying to go on TV telling us how the world could be better if somebody please could just do this, that, and this other thing. Corporations pay you just enough so you can live but not enough so that you can escape their leash. Anything else that entices you out of your hard-earned money (gambling, the lottery, education to better yourself, savings accounts that don't beat inflation, etc) are all cleverly planned scams to enrich others but not you. Having a low-paying job (and, with inflation, almost all jobs are low-paying), is no better than an addiction to heroin. Something you have to go back to every day to satisfy short-term needs but will ultimately kill you.    (I love JSG Boggs paintings of money)    I) Art.  Art has value, art has beauty, art is an expression of creativity. BUT, the business of art relies on the people who are clever enough to brand themselves, who gets the right representation, who can combine their creativity with enough business acumen to get noticed and ride the right trends. Two pieces of art can express equal creativity and insight but one could be worth $100,000,000 and the other could be worth $0. It's always interesting to me that Beethoven is considered art, for instance, but if someone wrote and performed Beethoven's 5 th  Symphony right now (and assuming Beethoven never wrote it) he would be laughed off the stage. Why? This is an unknown question to me. Although, personally, I'm a fan of A Fifth of Beethoven from the 70s classic movie Saturday Night Fever.   J) Books.  I walk into a bookstore and there's maybe 10,000 books. 9,995 of them are probably unreadable and intended that way. Most books break even for publishers and are losses for the authors. And are horribly written (it takes 10-20 years of practice to write a good book and most people have not put in the time. My first five books are awful, for instance).  So why do people write books?  For pedigree (I wrote a book about that!) To get speaking gigs (itself a scam industry. Companies spend $15,000 for an hour of someone's time so fat, lazy executives eating a fancy steak dinner can be entertained at a corporate outing before they call up escort services to help them get to sleep, drunk, bloated, and spent), to get clients (I wrote the book on this so you should hire me to give you advice  and most of the advice industry is a scam. If you can't figure something out for yourself and you are neck deep in it, then chances are someone else isn't going to figure it out for you). People also write books for freedom. There's the illusion that writers make their own hours, it's fun, and then you make millions. Which very rarely happens. I've seen it happen. To one person. Out of 100s of writers I know. [See,  How I've Lost Money on Ever Books I've Ever Written , and also  Why and How I Self-Published ]      (the modern day beethoven. if you can't see these images then go to jamesaltucher.com)   Wow, it seems like everything is a scam. So what's not a scam?  You. Ugh, that seems like a huge clich. I can imagine Tony Robbins with his headset while he walks around a stage. YOU! he points out at the audience. The audience is sick of BS. They are hoping he's right.Nobody wants to go back to their dead-end jobs and have their bosses take out all the anger about their unhappy marriages, their anger about their kids who talk back, their anger about their own bosses, the drinking, the hookers, the high cholesterol, all the anger that builds up in the bloated ambition of your boss until you are conveniently around for them to dump on.  Because they do, they will, you hate it, you take it, you plot revenge. I always plotted revenge. I'm going to get him. I'd walk around the block. Angry.  I'm going to get him . And then I end up yelling at the guy who bumps into me at Starbucks. Who then curses me but takes it out on his wife later. The scams of society rain down on us and then we're sinking in the quicksand of them while we grasp onto each other with anger, not caring that all we're doing is dragging each other down.     (By the way, I like Tony Robbins' stuff a lot. I just think the self-help industry in general tries too hard with too little results).  You.  You doesn't have to be a cliche. I have no headset. Well I do. I'm watching a pretty girl hula hoop on youtube while I write this and I'm using a headset so as not to bother Claudia. When I say I love the song on this youtube video its sort of like reading Playboy for the articles but it's true.  You don't have to be a scam. Be honest. Don't brand yourself like a cow. Don't kiss ass. Breathe as deeply as possible. Check yourself as much as possible for the thoughts that stress you and anger you. Learn  the not useful technique.  Then do the  Daily Practice  to make sure that you become the boss of your life.My next book, coming out in a few weeks, outlines this further than I've done before.  And also, NOW I NEED YOUR HELP!  Tell me other scams in society. I want to come up with 52. I want to make a deck of cards with the scams. Then I'm going to come up with The Scam Game. Sort of like Trivia Pursuit or Bridge but all about the ways people lie to us on a daily basis. By dissecting the lies (all of which cause massive stress), we can find the truth.  But it all goes back to focusing on  your inner happiness . And from that core of the Universe, generating the ideas, the plans, the truths, the businesses, the ideas, that can create external happiness. You are a marvelous human being.  So let me try that again. What's not a scam?  You aren't a scam.     "
the secrets of personal finance,"      I managed to totally screw things up for myself at the ages of 20, 22, 24, 29, 33, 37, and 40so I decided to write everything I know about so-called personal finance. The words personal finance are a total scam but I'll save that for another time. Let's just say, this is about how to build wealth and preserve your wealth.    The things you need to know.    The first answer is: nothing. You need to know absolutely nothing about personal finance. Buying a cheap beer versus buying an expensive beer will not help you get rich.    But, that seems cynical. So let me say congratulations first. You're 20 years old! Yay!    I can't even really remember 20 years old. I started my first business then. And failed at it. But that's another story.    When I was 22 I was thrown out of graduate school and then fired from 3 jobs in a row at higher and higher salaries where I saved nothing.    When I was 24 I moved to NYC and began the first of about ten career changes. The first rule of personal finance is that it's not personal and it's not financial. It's about your ability to make ten changes and not get too depressed over it.    During those career changes I made a lot of money. Then lost a lot. Then made a lot. Then lost a lot. Then made a lot more.    I did this so many times I made a study of what was working for me on the way up. And what wasn't working on the way down.    So I'm not an expert on anything. I just know WHAT HAS WORKED FOR ME to create massive success. I'm admitting it right now. I'm not just a failure.    First off, don't bother saving money. You get more money in the bank by making more money. That's rule #1.    People might think this is flippant. What if they can't make more money. Well, then, you're going to run out of money. No personal finance rule will help.    Buying coffee on the street instead of in a Starbucks is the poor man's way to get rich. In other words, you will never get rich by scratching out ten cents from your dollar.    People save 10 cents on a coffee and then.overpay $100,000 for a house and then do reconstruction on it.    Or they save 10 cents on a book and thenbuy a college degree that they never use for $200,000.    Now your real education can begin:    A) Don't save money. Make more. If you think this is not so easy then remember: whatever direction you are walking in, eventually you get there.    B) That said, don't spend money on the BIGGEST expenses in life. House and college (and kids and marriage but, of course, there are exceptions there). Just saving on these two things alone is worth over a million dollars in your bank account.    C) But doesn't renting flush money down the toilet? No, it doesn't. Do the math. You can argue all you want but the math is very clear as long as you are not lying to yourself.    D) Haven't studies shown that college graduates make more money 20 years later?    No, studies have not shown that. They show correlation but not causation and they don't take into account multi-collinearity (it could be that the children of middle class families have higher paying jobs later and, oh by the way, these children also go to college).    E) Don't invest in anything that you can't directly control every aspect of. In other wordsyourself.    In other words:    You can't make or save money from a salary.And salaries have been going down versus inflation for 40 years. So don't count on a salary. You're 20, please take this advice alone if you take any advice at all.  Investing is a tax on the middle class. There are at least 5 levels of fees stripped out of your hard-earned cash before your money touches an investment.    F) If you want to make money you have to learn the following skills. None of these skills are taught in college.    I'm not saying college is awful or about money, etc. I'm just saying that the only skills needed to make money will never be learned in college:    how to sell (both in a presentation and via copywriting)  how to negotiate (which means win-win, not war)  creativity (take out a pad, write down a list of ideas, every day)  leadership (give more to others than you expect back for yourself)  networking (a corollary of leadership)  how to live by themes instead of goals (goals will break your heart)  reinvention (which will happen repeatedly throughout a life)  idea sex (get good at coming up with ideas. Then combine them. Master the intersection)  the 1% rule (every week try to get better 1% physically, emotionally, mentally)  the google rule  always send people to the best resource, even if it's a competitor. The benefit to you comes back tenfold  give constantly to the people in your network. The value of your network increase linearly if you get to know more people but EXPONENTIALLY if the people you know, get to know and help each other.  how to fail so that a failure turns into a beginning  simple tools to increase productivity  how to master a field. You can't learn this in school with each field being regimented into equal 50 minute periods. Mastery begins when formal education ends. Find the topic that sets your heart on fire. Then combust.  stopping the noise: news, advice books, fees upon fees in almost every area of life. Create your own noise instead of falling in life with the others.    If you do all this you will gradually make more and more money and help more and more people. At least, I've seen it happen for me and for others.    I hope this doesn't sound arrogant. I've messed up too much by not following the above advice.    Don't plagiarize the lives of your parents, your peers, your teachers, your colleagues, your bosses.    Create your own life.    Be the criminal of their rules.    I wish I were you because if you follow the above, then you will most likely end up doing what you love and getting massively rich and helping many others.    I didn't do that when I was 20. But now, at 46, I'm really grateful I have the chance every day to wake up and improve 1%.

faq on how to become an idea machine,"     I was out of ideas when I googled how to kill myself.  I was sure that three things were going to happen: I'd go broke (and then my 3 year old would starve to death), nobody would kiss me ever again, and I would die because of course self worth = net worth (duh!).  I started coming up with 10 ideas a day and I've written about this several times before: it saved my life, my career, my friendships, made me better friendships, partners, opportunities, a wife, better relationships with my kids, and oooga-booga (lots of kisses).  In 2011, I wrote a post how to be the luckiest person alive where I described a daily practice I started to follow to get off the floor of suicide. Physical Emotional Mental and Spiritual health were the four pillars of this practice.  Under Mental was the approach that if you don't exercise your idea muscle every day it would atrophy and you would lose the ability to be creative.  So I encouraged people to write 10 ideas every day. I write 10 ideas every day no matter what. Yesterday, for instance, I wrote 10 ideas how Airbnb can be improved. Today I haven't written my list yet.  Over the past 4 years I've gotten a lot of questions about this approach. Many of the questions have been the same over and over again.  I've also gotten a lot of testimonials (unasked for) from people who told me they tried this approach and all the amazing things that happened to them afterwards.  For me, I can safely say, my life completely changes almost 100% every six months in every way because I simply write down 10 ideas a day.  Here I'm going to try and answer the questions that I often get asked. If you don't like my answers then feel free to ignore them.  If you have more questions, ask them in the comments and I will answer.  Different approaches work for different people. This approach works for me and I now see has worked for many others.   A) Is The Idea Muscle, or the Mental side of your daily practice, the most important part of the four?   No. They are all equally important. If you get sick, then you can't be as creative.  If you are staying up to midnight arguing with the loved ones in your life then you can't be creative (I learned this particularly well during my divorce).  If you are anxious all day instead of grateful (the spiritual side of the practice) then you can't be creative.  Worry never solves the future and always takes away energy from the present.  Of course, you can try. But it's hard. If a chair has four legs then it's sturdy. If you remove one leg, then you can still sit in it but it will fall over at the slightest wind. And we all have the winds of change blowing in our lives.  If you remove two of the legs then you will fall over. And if you try to sit in a one-legged chair then you probably need serious help in general.   B) Do you have a theme each day for your ideas?   Yes. As a simple example it might be 10 businesses I can start? Or 10 books I can write or 10 chapters I can write for a book on quality parenting (which would obviously be a fiction book).  Claudia is coming out with a book at the end of January with 180 possible themes.  A theme is like a target, and knowing that you can come up with 10 decent ideas gets you closer and closer to hitting the bullseye on the target.   C) What if I can't come up with 10 ideas?   Here's the key: the first three ideas are always easy. The next two are a little harder, and for me, I find that ideas 5-10 make my brain literally sweat. It almost hurts.  Ideas, art, business, life is all about connecting the dots of one area of your life with the dots in other areas of your life.  Doing this directly translates into biologically building up the neural pathways between collections of neurons in your brain.  This is what changes you from becoming a person with the occasional idea, to a creative person, to an idea machine. You become the one-eyed king in the land of the blind.   D) My idea muscle has atrophied. How long will it take to become an idea machine?   If you come up with 10 ideas a day for 180 days I'm pretty convinced based on what I've seen from 100s or 1000s of others then you will be a full force idea machine.   E) What is an idea machine?   It means that you can have confidence that no matter what situation you are in, you can start spewing ideas to help yourself and others in that situation. Ideas are about giving. And the more you give to the world, the more value you get back.  Almost everything you look at will become sources of inspiration. Almost every problem you hear about you'll be able to come up with solutions.  Will they be good solutions? No, not necessarily. Which brings me too.   F) Do all 10 ideas have to be good ideas?   That would be impossible. If you are writing 10 ideas a day, that's 3,650 ideas a year.  Nobody can come up with 3,650 good ideas a year. Someone who is a creative genius coming up with non-stop ideas might come up with a handful (less than 10) really good ideas and maybe slightly more (less than 100), decent ideas and the rest are probably bad ideas.  Part of the idea of this exercise is give yourself permission to come up with bad ideas. To love yourself by recognizing that nobody is perfect.  There's a story the advertising legend George Lois wrote where he says that he told everyone to come up with a great idea for a client. He came back in an hour and nobody had any ideas at all.  So he said, ok, come up with 20 ideas. He came back in an hour and everyone had 20 ideas. Some good, some bad, some decent. That's because they released the idea of perfectionism.  If you are a perfectionist, you will never come up with good ideas. You have to love yourself enough to come up with bad ideas and still be happy and confident.  If you wait for inspiration, you will never come up with good ideas.  Inspiration is not like lightning. It doesn't strike. It's always there, like a deep well. Only by digging every day, do we get to tap into that well.   G) I have so many ideas, I don't know which ones to work on? How do you pick?   I never do. I always throw out my idea list for the day. The whole purpose of the exercise is to (metaphorically) expand the brain. Nothing else.  Now, if an idea truly sets your heart on fire, then you won't forget it. The next day you'll come up with ten ideas to expand on that first idea. Or ten next steps to get that idea going.  When you are an idea machine, trust that this will happen. Again: the ideas that are good will literally set your heart and mind on fire and you won't be able to wait to come up with the next batch of ideas for them.  Don't think too much about which ideas are good and which ideas are bad. 99.99% of ideas are bad.  Once, when I came up with the idea for a good business (one among ten business ideas I wrote the day before), then the next day I came up with ten pages that would be on the website for that business.  And the next day I came up with ten ideas for partners that business might have. And the next day I came up with 10 ways I can execute on this business.  And that morning I started executing on that business. Two weeks later I had a big partner for that business. Eight months later I sold the business. Every week in between I had more and more features for that business.  I was excited about it. I loved it. I thought every day about it. If you have to look back at prior lists to remember the ideas, then they didn't excite you enough. Don't do it.   H) What is Idea sex?   All of life is about connecting the dots.  This is not a poetic metaphor. Since the Big Bang that created the universe, every piece of matter is the result of atoms combining and creating something new.  Life on Earth is about organic molecules combining and creating something new.  Societies are formed when people connect to form babies, when groups of people connect to form tribes, when tribes connect to form cities, or countries, and so on.  Any achievement in science is the connection of all the achievements before it. As evidence, look at any patent and see all the prior patents it refers to.  Any achievement in art is the accumulated knowledge and experience of all the artists and musicians and even scientists and philosophers, as well as personal experiences of the artist, that came before it.  I once did an experiment with a group of people. Write down 10 titles of books you would like to write. Now turn to your partner. Make a list of ten books combining the titles.  I asked for some examples. I loved all the results. For instance, a How to Make Toast in Space or A History of Music as Told by the Instruments of the greatest performers. And so on.  If you turn on any late night comedy show, the opening monologue is almost all idea sex. News topics of the day combined with set up / punch line.  The fastest way to generate themes and ideas is to take two different areas and combine them.  The fastest way to master any area of life, is to become good at two or more areas, intersect them in a unique way, and now you are the best in the world at the intersection.  If you look at every great achievement in history, idea sex was the impregnation of that achievement.   I) People say ideas are a dime a dozen and that execution is everything. Is this true?   No. Ideas are a dime for 3. A dozen ideas are hard. Try it.  And execution, of course, is the key to making something happen in the real world. But the purpose of this exercise is to just stay healthy in a creative way.  Ultimately, execution ideas are a subset of ideas.  Here's one experiment to try: make two columns. The first column might be 10 new business ideas. The second column might be 10 first execution steps.  So if my business idea is make an Isreali-Cuban fusion restaurant (bad idea). And my first execution step might be: Cook an Israeli-Cuban meal and invite 10 friends over and charge them $30 and see if they like it.  Always start with easy execution steps. MVEs. Minimum viable execution steps.   J) Are the ideas usually about starting new businesses?   No, usually not. It's really hard to come up with 3,650 business ideas a year.  Money is just a side effect of being an idea machine.  I try to make it about anything. 50 alternatives to college was created this way.  Or 10 Ways I'd improve self-publshing which I sent to Amazon and they invited me to come out there and see what they were working on.  Or 10 ideas for a novel or 10 pairs of people I should introduce to each other. And on and on. 10 things I can cook for Claudia tonight (that one was REALLY hard for me. I'm not a good cook).   K) I keep coming up with good ideas but then I go out drinking with my friends on Friday night and tell them my ideas and they all laugh at me. What should I do?   Stay home on Friday night.   L) I've been doing this for three months and I haven't seen any difference in my life?   Do it for three more months and you will. Every day.  In order to build a house, the foundation has to be strong.  The foundation gets strong when you focus on all areas of the daily practice. Physical health, emotional health (be around people you love), and spiritual health.  Anger, envy, self-pity, regret, anxiety are all fires that burn the foundation. Gratitude and surrender washes away those fires.  Then you can build your house. Then you can live in it.   M) I have no time to do this. What should I do?   Simplify your life. The simpler every part of your life is, the more power you have to make significant changes in the world.  The first thing is: do you really have no time? I've now spoken to or read about two different people who have written best-selling novels on their train commutes to work.  Another key is to avoid meaningless gossip at work. Or to stop watching bad TV at night. Or to wake up a half hour earlier than usual. Or to spend 15 less minutes surfing on Facebook.  Heck, make a list of the 10 ways you waste time every day.  I have found in my own life that these fragments of time often add up to hours a day.  The other thing is to do what I call the simple daily practice.  Do tiny things. Maybe don't snack today (Physical), maybe write a thank you email to someone you love (emotional), come up with 10 ideas (mental), spend 10 minutes feeling grateful (spiritual).  There's always time. Nobody starts off at the top. Which leads to   N) I have an Idea. How do I get money for it?   You don't. You have to implement it. You have to have other people who like it. You have to get money from customers who like it. You have to build up so that it can support yourself.  For my first business, I started it, got customers, got employees, had an office, and then, 18 months into it, I quit my fulltime job, and went to my startup fulltime.  That's how business works in the real world.  We live in an entitled world now where people think ideas are enough now to get funding and make billions.  Go old school. Deliver proven value to others, charge money for it, get testimonials about how good your product is, and then you've widened the horizon of your decisions. That's the path to success.   O) How do I know if an idea is good?   Well, chances are it's pretty bad. The key again is to expand the abilities of your brain so you are a non-stop idea machine. This way you are more likely to come up with a good idea.  A great story is the story of the company, Odeo.  They created software for podcasting. They got professional venture capitalists investing. The CEO previously sold a company to Google so he knew what he was doing. He had the top software programmers working for him.  But nobody wanted his software. On the side, Odeo's programmers had a side project going, but it only had 10,000 users. Smaller audience than most good blogs. And yet  The CEO told all of his investors, we give up. We're going to work on this side project. If you want to stay in, good. If you want out, I will buy all of your shares so you wont' lost any money.  The result: 100% of the top, most professional investors in the business took their money back. The CEO renamed the company and focused on the tiny software project.  A few years later Twitter became public and is worth tens of billions of dollars.  Nobody can predict the outcome of an idea. And usually people are wrong. That's why quantity is important.  The key is to every day stay physically emotionally mentally and spiritually healthy.  Then you can trust that you have built the inner foundation for outward success.  The outer world that you face every morning is always a reflection of the inner world that only you can create.   P) What if I have more than 10 ideas a day? Should I save some of them for the next day?   No, write them all down. THIS POST is my idea list of the day. I just wrote down 16 items Yesterday was 10. The day before was about 12.  What's going to happen if you do this for six months?  You're going to be a mutant superhero.  You're going to have fun creative ideas for every situation. You're going to be able to see which ideas set your brain on nuclear.  You're going to meet the right people who can help you execute on ideas. You're going to turn into a fountain of giving.  You're going to be the sort of person that understands that less effort leads to greater accomplishments.  You're going to be immortal because you will begin to lead a life that is worth remembering forever.     "
how to be a bad leader,"    I am the best bad leader in the world. Not only do I know everything about how to fail as a leader but I also have spent large amounts of time with bad leaders.  This is a UNIQUE opportunity for you to hear what the top 10 qualities are of bad leaders.  All of the time I read articles, Top 10 Qualities of GREAT Leaders.  Why do people write these articles? Were they great leaders? I have no idea. In most cases it doesn't seem so. It seems like they write a lot of articles about leaders. Study is one thing, writing is the next thing, but doing and then repeat is how you learn.  So why do they write these articles? Many reasons and I applaud them for all of those reasons.  They write them to get name recognition. They write them to get consulting gigs. To be a life coach maybe to other leaders or CEOs. They write them to get speaking gigs.  And that technique works. I know this. If you write enough articles about leadership, someone will pay you to teach them how to be a leader. Try it and you'll see.  But I have to stick with what I know. I know a thing or two about good leadership. But good leadership is very rare. I can count a list of good leaders on my two hands. Larry Page is a good leader. Winston Churchill is a good leader.  I have known and worked with and worked for many bad leaders. Plus I have been a bad leader many times in my life. I don't know if I'd be a good leader now. But I do know the mistakes I made that caused me to crash and burn in leadership.  Sometimes, to be a little bit better, you just have to avoid the little bit worse.  So let's get started. The qualities of a bad leader.   A) NOT UNDERSTANDING THE 30/150 RULE    A leader has to follow the 30 / 150 rule or they will be a bad leader.  This rule has worked for 200,000 years. If a rule works for 2 years then ignore it. If a rule has worked for 200,000 years then pay attention to it.  For 200,000 years humans were tribes. Every tribe had a leader but when the tribe got too big for one leader (more than 30 people), it would split in two.  Then, around 70,000 years ago we evolved to handle tribes up to 150 people.  Then maybe 10,000 years ago we figured out how to be above 150 people. But this is so new, an evolutionary blip, that we screw it up all the time.  But for each of these three categories (&lt; 30 people, &lt; 150 people, &gt; 150 people) give bad leaders an opportunity to prove how bad they are. I'll tell you how right now. A bad leader will not change his behavior no matter how many people he or she leads.   B) UNDER 30 PEOPLE. AVOIDING ONE ON ONE GIVING.   If you are a leader of less than 30 people, you have to know intimately the problems of all 30 people (or less) in your organization.  You have to know their skills. What they are good at. What they are bad at. What they want to be good at. What their dreams are.  Each person should be assigned ONE thing. That's their responsibility. Bad leaders give people many things and then those peopledo mediocre jobs at all of them instead of being responsible for their one special egg they have to carry from one side of the room to the other on a spoon.  When I was running a company with less than 30 people I would take random employees with me to meetings. So this way they would see the effect the company had on our clients or other people would deal with. My goal: I knew I had limitations as a leader. So I wanted my employees to be leaders.  Bad leaders get jealous of the people underneath them and never hire people smarter than them. This is the #1 most common thing a bad leader does.  Understand each of the 30 people at an intimate level. Know who their parents are. Know what they do for fun. Help them maximize their skills. Make them succeed and shine past you.  This maybe is the one time I was a decent leader. I don't know. But, to this day, I still know and am friends with each one of those 30. Give to them more than they give to you and they will still be giving to you 20 years later. This I know for a fact.   C) ABOVE 30 PEOPLE, BUT BELOW 150. HOW TO SCREW IT UP.   When your organization is between 30 and 150, it's impossible for you to know everyone.  So make sure everyone is talking about everyone else. I want to be able to ask A what B is like to work with and I want a real good answer.  The people reporting directly to you should be giving more than they are getting to the people working for them. That's how you get to know people.  And then thats how the leader, indirectly, gets to know the entire 150 when he or she is putting together teams and assignments and trying to inspire people for a common goal.   D) FAILING THE VISION THING   Above 150 people you need to do many things.  But here's the #1 thing leaders fail at. No vision.  What's a vision? I suppose a 1000 boring books can be written about this. Let's hold off for a second on defining it.  But above 150, it's impossible to know everyone in your organization or even know second-hand about everyone in your organization. So the most important thing you can do, in fact the ONLY thing you can do, is lead by example.  For instance, what if 50,000 people are in your organization. Or in the case of the President of the United Stated, 300 million people.  You can't unify the people by talking to each one and understanding their problems. You can't define roles and fulfill dreams for people by talking to others who know everyone.  You have to unify them with a story. A story everyone believes in and is inspired by and is willing to follow.  So if you and I believe in the Yankees, we're more likely to trust each other than if I like the Yankees and you like the Mets.  All stories: religions, nationalism, politics, issues, etc are more or less designed to figure out how to unify the greatest number of people with the strongest ties possible.  Because we are not so good at it, often this degrades into wars, or poor leadership, or things just disappear into the furnace of time.  When Tim Cook becameCEO of Apple, everyone was afraid the story would change. The stock dropped.  What was the story? It wasn't that Steve Jobs gets the most profits. A story is rarely about money (although money itself is probably the strongest story on the planet).  It's that Steve Jobs had the greatest combination of technology + design. Could Tim Cook keep that story going? Tim Cook's leadership will be entirely judged on whether he keeps that story going or if he can successfully change the story.  Actually, he has to do both. Because if he tries to turn himself into Steve Jobs then he will be judged on the story of: is Tim Cook just a bad version of Steve Jobs.  So it's a delicate balance. One that has to be dealt with every day in order for him to attract the best employees, keep his customers happy, keep his investors happy, and probably to keep himself happy.  This is leadership.   E) HAVING A BAD VISION   Okay, let's get closer to defining a bad vision. Good visions are difficult to come up with. It's pretty rare.  But since I know so many bad leaders I can tell you first an example of bad visions.  I've been in the management of at least two companies worth over a billion dollars. In both cases, leadership was horrible.  How did they get to a billion dollars with such bad leadership? Easy. Anyone can do that part. I will tell you how.  They went public on the stock market and then used their shares to buy other companies. Every city has a smaller version that can be acquired by the bigger version. So buy a lot of smaller versions of you and you add up the numbers and suddenly you have a billion in revenues.  But your only vision was: we just bought a lot of companies that do the same thing and now we have a billion dollars in revenues!  Ach! Your vision might even be worse than that. It might be We just bought a lot of companies, fired all of the HR people and accounting people (because we had them in the main office) and now we have a billion in revenues and even greater profits and margins!  Every company that has ever done that has failed.  Some companies did that and came close to failing. For example, Google never had a chance of failing. But they were buying a company a week when Eric Schmidt was the CEO. They weren't quite bringing these companies in under the fold correctly and Google was starting to flounder. Divisions were being shut down. Morale was at a low because the vision of Google was starting to flounder.  Larry Page took over and changed the story. He said, Google is the best in the world at these four things and he closed down everything that wasn't part of one of those four silos.  Everyone left in one of those silos can now say, We are the best in the world at this and that contributes to the larger vision of Google of having the entirety of world information at your fingertips wherever you are. The first company in world history to do this.  Man, I wish I worked at Google, to be honest. It almost happened once when I tried to sell a company to them. I loved their vision so much I wanted to bathe every inch of my body in it. I wanted to be religious about it.  And that's what all great religious leaders do. They tell a story. Some elements of a good story:   We fight an evil force (think the Apple 1984 commercial against IBM. Think Buddha rejecting the caste system. Think Washington rejecting a third term because he didn't want the Presidency to turn into a monarchy).  We have something mysterious that nobody else has (a deity, better design philosophy, better technology, etc).  We think people will be happier if they work with us, subscribe to us, join us. Apple often has inferior products to other comparable products. But people are actually happier with an Apple product because the story is so strong.  Our leaders have seen the light or come out from the cold. Steve Jobs had to leave his company for a decade in order to come back a hero. Buddha had to leave his home for seven years to achieve enlightenment.Mandela was in jail for decades.  Together we are better than apart. The bigger we are, the better we can help people who join us. So..if a company is buying lots of smaller companies, they need a vision that explains why bigger is better.For instance, we're able to help people faster because we understand the needs in every city in the world.  Social proof. A vision should have other stories within it. People your vision has helped. People whose lives became better. People who can stand up and say, this changed my life.   Bad corporate leaders will do this: buy all the companies, fire all the waste, report good numbers to the stock market, and then sell their stock, the stock goes down, the company falls apart.  I've seen that happen a lot.   F) BAD LEADERS DON'T WANT YOU TO CALL YOUR MOTHER   Every day, the people following a good leader should be able to call their parents and say, I'm so happy. You won't believe what I did/ learned/ met today.   G) BAD LEADERS TALK BADLY ABOUT THEIR CLIENTS OR EMPLOYEES OR CONSTITUENTS   I was giving a talk at one company. It turns out they mostly hated their clients.  I was surprised. How can you hate your clients? They are the ones who pay you money. They are the reason you come into work.  If you hate what your clients' story is, how you can help them achieve their dreams. Something will always block you from performing the best service for them.  Leadership is not about achieving your dream. It's about helping everyone else achieve their dreams.  This is not the employees' fault. Everything comes from the leaders. If the leader doesn't love the clients/constituents then the people below the leader and the people below them won't.  Trickle-down leadership is the only leadership.   H) BAD LEADERS DON'T WANT YOU TO PASS THEM   I've had four mentors in my life. Some people tried to be a mentor also but they didn't quite have that mentorish effect on me.  What do I mean by that?  It means I wanted to be like them. I wanted my life path to mirror theirs. I wanted to mimic their behavior and learn their knowledge so I could be as successful as them.  I've had many more teachers than four. But maybe only four mentors.  And here's what happened to each one of them: they all wanted me to fail at some point. That's a bad mentor.  I learned what I could from them. I did everything they asked. I helped each one of them with their continual successes.  But at some point, when I wanted to go on my own and learn more and start my own business or direction, they all were angry and they all tried to stop me and none of them talk to me anymore.  In two cases, they actively tried to damage me even though I had never done anything but help them. It even gets worse but I don't want to put anyone down. I was aware of the dangers and went into it willingly.  A good leader helps the people around them succeed past them. A great example is Stanford professor, Rajeev Montwani.  What!? Who is he?  Well, he was Sergey Brin's advisor. And instead of trying to keep Brin in a cage, he opened the cage and Brin flew out and started Google with fellow grad student Larry Page. Now Montwani is a billionaire as a result.  Leadership doesn't ask the question How good can I get? How far can I get?  Leadership asks the question, How far can the people around me get?  People always say negative things about Steve Jobs, because of unfair media portrayals of him. But if Steve Jobs was such a bad person he wouldn't have been as great a leader as he is.  People like Tim Cook, Jony Ive, John Lasseter (from Pixar) and many others (even Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney), Tony Fadell (developer of the iPod, who just sold Nest for $3.2 billion to Google) owe huge amounts of their success, their creativity, the distribution of their creativity, and their freedom and well-being, to the fact that at one point or other they were mentored by Steve Jobs or benefited from leadership decisions made by Steve Jobs.  All of these people were very self-motivated, which is how they found themselves with someone like Steve Jobs as a mentor.  But combine that self-motivation with the leadership skills of Steve Jobs and you end up with great success.  The same thing happened at Google with the leadership skills of Larry Page.  The CEOs or COOs of Twitter, Facebook, AOL, and Yahoo all were at one point mentees of Larry Page and are now successful leaders and mentors themselves.   I) BAD LEADERS DON'T KNOW THEIR NUMBERS   I'm raising my hand. When I ran companies it took me a long time to realize what numbers I needed to know.  For instance, when you run a company you need to know not only your revenues and earnings but also your revenues and earnings per employee, per customer, per square foot, etc.  This applies whether you are the leader of a company, of a meetup group, of a country, of anything.  What are the metrics you need to know to determine success?  For instance, if you are the teacher of a class, come up with a list of things you hope your students achieve by the end of the class.  Not all of them will achieve it. That's okay.  List each student. Next to each student's name, list all of the things you want them to achieve. At the beginning of the class, list each item for each student on a scale of 1-10.  Add up all the numbers for all students so you have one final number. This is the number you are starting with.  By the time the class is over, that number should be higher. It might mean just one student succeeded greatly. That's okay. Then you were a good leader.  If you are having a hard time coming up with the right metrics, just use these: competence, relationships, autonomy. Help each person get better at those three things.  By the way, it's important to have metrics. I visited a company recently that I felt had a bad vision for their customers. Bad metrics used to define the success of their customers. But even a bad vision is better than no vision.   J) BAD LEADERS DON'T GET RID OF BAD PEOPLE   I was involved with a company once that had a weak leader. He owed his leadership to the largest shareholder of the company.  The problem is: the largest shareholder of the company was hideously corrupt. The good leader should have disassociated himself from the large shareholder, built a vision around his own leadership.  Instead, he became mired in thefinancial difficulties of the largest shareholder, was unable to unify the divisions underneath him and provide effective mentorship to the people who directly worked for him.  The company fell apart a year after he took over as CEO.  Bad leadership, no matter what the situation, can cause almost instantaneous collapse. The 2008 failures of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers are great examples.  When Bear Stearns stock price was falling from $80 to $2 within the space of a week, the CEO was off playing in a bridge tournament. Bridge is a card game.  While he was playing cards, thousands of employees lost their jobs. And the downfall of Bear Stearns triggered the dominos that ultimately led to the multi trillion dollar bailouts of all banks and insurance firms that happened over the next ten months after the fall of Bear Stearns.  Ultimately, the person who had installed him to be leader of Bear Stearns should've removed him or recognized his own character defects.  Here's the problem with that and I'll mention it in the next point   K) A BAD LEADER OFTEN HAS ENORMOUS CHARISMA   How can someone who is a bad leader reach a leadership position?  Easy. They have enormous charisma. They are insanely smart and know how to charm the leaders who came before them.  A great example might be the set of a movie production. The director is the leader. But he has a big problem. Actors are hired because of their enormous (ENORMOUS) charisma. The world loves them. So when they want something, it's hard to say no to them. A good director has to fight the urge to succumb to the charisma of the people he is leading and stay focused on the vision.  For instance, in the case of Bear Stearns, the intoxication happened the instant the original leader, Alan Greenberg, met the new guy.  Jim Cayne, the new guy,was a professional bridge player. In fact, that's all he was. To play bridge well (to play any professional-level game well) you need years of study, you need to be able to read people very well, you need to know numbers very well and to calculate many situations in your head quickly.  All of these things are attributes of good leaders and so those tools can often fool other good leaders into thinking you are a good leader. But unfortunately for everyone, Jim Cayne was JUST a good bridge player and was not good at anything else.  Many good leaders who are successful game players include Bill Gates (bridge), Warren Buffett (bridge), Peter Thiel (chess), and numerous others.  Alan Greenberg was an aspiring bridge player. He met Jim Cayne, who was a great bridge player. He asked Jim, How good are you? and Jimsaid, if you played me for 100 years you will never be able to beat me. That began the road to success for Cayneand then the entire collapse of the American economy.   L) BAD LEADERS SMOKE CRACK   I don't mean literally. Although if they smoked real crack they probably will never get to a real leadership position.  There's a cognitive bias that causes people to not see their own failings. They've spent so much time, effort, and money creating their particular vision that they have investment bias that prevents their brains from saying, maybe I've made a mistake.  A bad leader will not admit his faults or even think about them. It's too painful to think about those faults because of this cognitive bias. The brain will revolt or the leader will get depressed or start to doubt his leadership skills.  One time I was starting a company at the same as a friend of mine. I knew instantly his company was bad but, perhaps I was not a good enough friend, I didn't tell him his idea was bad.  Instead I would question him: who are the users? Who are the customers? How will you make money?  I wanted him to see for himself through my questions that his idea was bad.  But because I was asking these questions it sort of woke me up. Every day I would ask myself the same questions about my own company. Every day I would call my partners and ask them, am I smoking crack and I would go over the questions with them.  This process forced me to outline new features every day that could help me provide better services to my customers.  I sold my business eight months to the day after I started it for $10,000,000.  My friend's business: nine years later he's still pushing it. It has zero revenues.  You have to step outside yourself and do due diligence on your own organization as if you were an outsider. Come up in advance, all of the metrics of success. Decide if those are the correct metrics.  You have to assume you are smoking crack because often you will be. You can't help it. We're all human. So get help from others in your organization. Get help from customers. Get help from people outside the organization.  They won't always be right either. And sometimes they will lie to you just to avoid being hurtful to your dreams (just like I was with my friend).  The only person who can ultimately prevent you from smoking crack is you. This separates the good leaders from the bad leaders in many cases.   M) BAD LEADERS WERE BAD EMPLOYEES   Leadership starts long before you reach the top of an organization or community. At any point in your career, you are either a thermostat or a thermometer. You either define the temperature of the people around youand help them to achieve their goals and dreams, or you simply do as your told and be a follower and never inspire.  How do you become the thermostat?   Every day, 1% improvement on yourself in the areas of physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. This 1% compounds very very quickly.  Every day, do something to help the people around you achieve greater competence, better relationships, and more freedom in their choices.  Repeat this: help others, then give them full credit. Whether it's your boss or your colleagues or your friends or family or whoever.   Bad employees and leaders do the opposite of the above. But leadership starts at the bottom, does these three things, and floats to the top.      Leadership is a vague term. Because sometimes the boss is not the leader. Sometimes the king is ruled by his court. Sometimes the artist is supported and driven by the leaders in her entourage.  And there are so many pitfalls along the way. It's easy to get caught up in ego, money, bad visions, the enticements that flirt with you the higher in the ladder you go. The feeling of, Ok, I've done it! when there's still a long path to travel on.  So that's why I never trust the articles that say here's how to be a good leader.  But I know that I have succumbed to all of the above pitfalls. And if I try to just avoid them (or do them LESS), then maybe one day I can be a good leader.  A leader of what? Well, first, my self.      Come and meet me at the   Global Family Reunion Festival  , the world's largest family reunion on Saturday, June 6th in Queens, New York. This event is going to be in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest family reunion ever.

21 or 22 yet even more amazing tips to be a better writer,"     My 12 year old daughter is afraid to talk to me because I might write it. My sister doesn't speak to me. My mom doesn't speak to me. I suspect even Claudia is afraid of what she says to me.  When I was seven years old I plagiarized word for word stories from science fiction magazines so my teachers would think I was smart.  When I was 22 years old I thought girls would like me if I wrote a novel. I spent so much time writing that I was thrown out of graduate school.  My first published book caused me to get fired when my boss thought I stole all his ideas.  My sister wrote me, you're a horrible person.  But I still want people to like me.     Tip #1: NOBODY IS AN ADVANCED WRITER. Everyone needs to improve. I've written 13 books. Some bestsellers. I write every day. I've written for newspapers, books, blogs, TV and t-shirts.  It's a cliche but the more I write, the further I am from thinking I know how to write or anything at all about writing. So this list is really just for me.   Tip #2: READ OUT LOUD. Read every sentence you write out loud. If it sounds boring, kill it.   Tip #3: TAKE A STORY YOU LOVE AND WRITE IT OUT. It has to be a great story you love. I like the story Emergency by Denis Johnson. I write it out over and over as if I'm writing it. I don't know why this works and maybe it doesn't (see Tip #1) but I like doing it.   Tip #4: STEAL. If you see a line you like in another book, figure out how you would rewrite it, even slightly, and then steal it. It's still beautiful.   Tip #5: I TOOK THIS TIP OUT WHEN I REWROTE THIS. It was bullshit.   Tip #6: READ. Read writers who write exactly how you want to write. Because then you will pretty close to them. But then mix it up. Read different writers every day. I read Jude Angelini today and Douglas Adams.   Tip #7: THE 2 DAY RULE: If you don't write for 2 days in a row then you'll be a bad writer again and have to build up. This is not meant to make anyone feel bad. It just makes me feel bad when I don't write for 2 days in a row.   Tip #8: WAITER'S PAD. Any semi-interesting thing that happens to you or you think about, quickly write it down on a waiter's pad. YOU WILL ALWAYS FORGET IT if you don't. I always say, I'll remember and then I don't.   Tip #9: SOMEONE DIES IN THE FIRST LINE. Even in a non-fiction essay about bioplastics, make sure YOU bleed in the first line. Else, people switch screens to Twitter.   Tip #10: THE F RULE. People read screens in an F pattern. They read the first line or two. Then they read down the left (hence list posts are so popular). So make sure you keep bleeding so they read more.  People only feed off blood.   Tip #11: HUMOR. Kids laugh 300 times a day. Adults laugh only5 times a day. Make an adult feel like a kid again. To acquire humor I often read something funny or watch standup. Humor isn't ON all the time.   Tip #12: THE 30% RULE: When you are finished with your masterpiece, don't stop rewriting until you have cut at least 30%.   Tip #13: URGENT. If a line is not urgent, take it out.   Tip #14: USEFUL: If your piece is not useful, or if it just repeats the boring stuff everyone else says, then don't do it. Even if it's fiction.   Tip #15: THE BILLIONAIRE RULE. If a girl barely out of her teenage years is not physically dominated by a billionaire who is plagued by emotional issues stemming from his father then chances are most of the world won't read it.   Tip #16: THE LEARNING RULE: More bullshit.   Tip #17: GET PAID, GET LAID, LOSE WEIGHT. If you write non-fiction, those are the three things people like to read most.   Tip #18: BLOOD TRANSFUSION. Even though you're bleeding your own blood, make sure it's the same color as everyone else's blood.   Tip #19. COFFEE: Drink coffee 20 minutes before you write. Sets your brain on fire. Makes you go to the bathroom. Cleans your body out before you set your heart on fire.   Tip #20: ABS: Always be storytelling. Life is cold. People stay warm through the intimacy of a story.   Tip #21: BE VERY AFRAID: Don't hit publish unless you're scared what people will think of you.   Tip #22. BE A CRIMINAL. Break all of the rules. Not the above rules. EVERY rule.  Artists steal, kill, lie, and play. Isabelle Allende says, once a writer is born into a family, the family is over. Be a killer.  And then I met the girl and she fell in love with me and we lived happily ever after.     "

You have to write a big fat check for a downpayment. But its an investment, you might say to me. Historically this isn't true. Housing returned 0.4% per year from from 1890 to 2004. And that's just housing prices. It forgets all the other stuff I'm going to mention below. Suffice to say, when you write that check, you're never going to see that money again. Because even when you sell the house later you're just going to take that money and put it into another downpayment. So if you buy a $400,000 home, just say goodbye to $100,000 that you worked hard for. You can put a little sign on the front lawn: $100,000 R.I.P.    (you might as well set this cash on fire if you buy a home)   B)  Closing costs.  I forget what they were the last two times I bought a house. But it was about another 2-3% out the window. Lawyers, title insurance, moving costs, antidepressant medicine. It adds up. 2-3%.  C)  Maintenance . No matter what, you're going to fix things. Lots of things. In the lifespan of your house, everything is going to break. Thrice. Get down on your hands and knees and fix it! And then open up your checkbook again. Spend some more money. I rent. My dishwasher doesn't work. I call the landlord and he fixes it. Or I buy a new one and deduct it from my rent. And some guy from Sears comes and installs it. I do nothing. The Sears repairman and my landlord work for me.  D)  Taxes . There's this myth that you can deduct mortgage payment interest from your taxes. Whatever. That's a microscopic dot on your tax returns. Whats worse is the taxes you pay. So your kids can get a great education. Whatever.  E)  You're trapped.  Lets spell out very clearly why the myth of homeownership became religion in the United States. Its because corporations didn't want their employees to have many job choices. So they encouraged them to own homes. So they can't move away and get new jobs. Job salaries is a function of supply and demand. If you can't move, then your supply of jobs is low. You can't argue the reverse, since new adults are always competing with you.  ]   F)  Ugly . Saying my house is an investment forgets the fact that a house has all the qualities of the ugliest type of investment:   Illiquidity. You can't cash out whenever you want.  High leverage. You have to borrow a lot of money in most cases.  No diversification. For most people, a house is by far the largest part of their portfolio and greatly exceeds the 10% of net worth that any other investment should be.    Personal reasons to not own a house . [Also,  Follow me on twitter.  ]  A)  Trapped , part 2. Some people like to have roots. But I like things to change every once in awhile. Starting March, 2009 I was renting an apartment directly across the street from the New York Stock Exchange. It was fun. I'd look out the window and see Wall Street. How exciting! Before that  I lived in The Chelsea Hotel with Chubb Rock . Last year we decided to relax and move a little north. Now I look out the window and see the Hudson River. And its quiet and I can walk along the river in the morning with no noise. It took us two weeks to pick a place and move. No hassles. I like to live a hassle-free life.      (click for my favorite Chubb Rock song)   B)    Walls . You can't change the walls when you rent. A lot of people seem to want to tear down walls. Or paint them. Sometimes when you rent you can't do these things. Well, make sure you have a landlord that lets you tear down walls. There must be some ancient evolutionary tic that makes us want to tear down walls or put nails in them or paint them. I don't get it. I like the walls to stay right where they are.  C)  Rent . People will argue that the price of the mortgage, maintenance taxes, etc is all baked into the price of rent. Sometimes this is true. But usually not.  D)  Psychology . Look at your personal reasons for wanting to own. Do you feel like you can't accomplish something in life until you own a house? Do you feel like its part of getting married and Settling down, i.e. creating a nest for your future children? For you, is it a part of becoming an adult. Is this what your parents taught you? Examine the real reasons you want to own and make sure they are coming from a good spot in your heart.  E)  Your time.  Do you really want to spend all that time working on your house? Is this where your time is best spent towards creating a happy and fulfilled life for yourself?  F)  Choices . I feel when I rent I always have the choice to leave. To live wherever in the world I want whenever I want. Adventure becomes a possibility even if I never take advantage of it.     G)  Stress . For me (not for everyone) owning a home equals stress. I saw what my parents went through at their worst moments owning a home. I saw what I and others went through in the Internet bust when I first owned a home. I saw what people went through in 2008. People were killing themselves. I don't like that sort of stress.  This is how I deal with stress.    H)  Cash is king . I like cash in the bank. I like having access to it. I don't like it all tied up in one illiquid investment. I want to fill a bathtub with all the dollar bills I would've used as a downpayment on a house. I want to bathe in that bathtub. I'm going to do that later today in fact.  By the way, this is going to sound like a contradiction: but I think housing is a great investment right now. I think housing prices have gone down far enough and I can list the reasons why housing as an abstract investment concept is going to go higher from here. But I don't like to write about investing on this blog. Suffice to say there are many stocks you can buy, with leverage if you want to take advantage of the rise in housing. But I'm never going to buy a home again. And sit there in the middle of the night thinking, why the hell did I do this to myself again.  ___________   [Please Follow me on twitter @jaltucher .

8 alternatives to college,"    When I was 19 I won some money in a chess tournament. So instead of using that money for my college tuition I decided to drop out of college and buy a car. I bought a used 1982 Honda Accord. I drove it around for a few hours since they let me drive it right out of the lot. But when I saw my girlfriend and everyone else taking their classes I got a little jealous. I returned the car and cancelled the check and entered my sophomore year of college. But I regret it now.  Whenever I suggest don't send your kids to college a lot of vey smart people invariably come back with the response, well what else should they do. And this amazes me. I guess its really hard to figure out what people of the ages 18-23 should do during the most vibrant, healthy years of their lives when they grow from being a child to an adult.  So I figure I will help people out by coming up with a list and try to handle the critcisms that will certainly arise even before they arise. I can do this because I have a college degree. So I've learned how to think and engage in repartee with other intelligent people.   1) Start a business.  There are many businesses a kid can start, particularly with the Internet. On another post I will list the possible types for first businesses. But if you always focus on the maxim, buy low and sell high, you'll start to generate ideas.  Many people say (correctly), well, not everyone can be an entrepreneur. Its amazing to me, also, how many times I've answered this question in writing and yet people still read the exact articles and say well not everyone can be an entrepreneur.  First off, there's no law against being an entrepreneur. In fact, everyone can be an entrepreneur. So what they really mean is: not everyone can be a successful entrepreneur. And as far as I know, there's no law against failure either. When someone loses a tennis match or a chess game. how do they improve? They study their loss. As anyone who has mastered any field in life knows: studying your losses is infinitely more valuable than studying your wins. I failed at my first three attempts at being an entrepreneur before I finally learned how to spell it and I finally had a success (i.e. a company with profits that I was then able to sell).  Failure is a part of life. Better to learn it at 18 than at 23 or older when you've been coddled by ivory blankets and hypnotized into thinking success was yours for the taking. Get baptized in the river of failure as a youth so you can blossom in entrepreneurial blessings as an adult.  What do you learn when you are young and start a business (regardless of success or failure):   you learn how to come up with ideas that will be accepted by other people  you begin to build your bullshit detector (something that definitely does not happen in college)  you learn how to sell your idea  you learn how to build and execute on an idea  you meet and socialize with other people in your space. They might not all be the same age but, lets face it, thats life as an adult. You just spent 18 years with kids your age. Grow up!  you might learn how to delegate and manage people  you learn how to eat what you kill, a skill also not learned by college-goers    [follow me on twitter for more updates about college, life, etc.]    2) Travel the world.  Here's a basic assignment. Take $10,000 and get yourself to India. Check out a world completely different from our own. Do it for a year. You will meet other foreigners traveling. You will learn what poverty is. You will learn the value of how to stretch a dollar. You will often be in situations where you need to learn how to survive despite the odds being against you. If you're going to throw up you might as well do it from dysentery than from drinking too much at a frat party. You will learn a little bit more about eastern religions compared with the western religions you grew up with. You will learn you aren't the center of the universe. Knock yourself out.      3) Create art.  Spend a year learning how to paint. Or how to play a musical instrument. Or write 5 novels. Learn to discipline yourself to create. Creation doesn't happen from inspiration. It happens from perspiration, discipline, and passion. Creativity doesn't come from from God. Its a muscle that you need to learn to build. Why not build it while your brain is still creating new neurons at a breathtaking rate than learning it when you are older (and for many people, too late).      4) Make people laugh.  This is the hardest of all. Spend a year learning how to do standup-comedy in front of people. This will teach you how to write. How to communicate. How to sell yourself. How to deal with people who hate you. How to deal with the psychology of failure on a daily basis. And, of course, how to make people laugh. All of these items will help you later in life much more than Philosophy 101 will. And, by the way, you might even get paid along the way.   [follow me on twitter for more updates about college, life, etc.]    5) Write a book.  Believe me, whatever book you write at the age of 18 is probably going to be no good. But do it anyway. Write a novel about what you are doing instead of going to college. You'll learn how to observe people. Writing is a meditation on life. You'll live each day, interpret it, write it. What a great education!   6) Work in a charity . Plenty of charities do not require you to have a college degree. What is going to serve you better in life: taking French LIterature 101 or spending a year delivering meals to senior citizens with Alzheimers, or curing malaria in Africa. I have an answer to this. You might have a different one. Which is why I'm listing 8 alternatives here instead of just this one. And, by the way, if you do any of these items for a year, two years, maybe ten, then maybe go to college? Why not? Its your life.   7) Master a game:  What's your favorite game? Ping pong? Chess? Poker? Learning how to master a game is incredibly hard. I've written before how to do it but lets start with the basics:   study the history of the game  study current experts on the game. videos, books, magazines, etc. Replay, or try to imitate in some way, the current masters of the game  Play a lot: with friends, in tournaments, at local clubs, etc.  take lessons from someone who has already mastered the game. This helps you to avoid bad habits and gets someone to immediately criticize your current skills.   Mastering a game builds discipline, lets you socialize with other people of all ages and backgrounds but who have similar passions, and helps you to develop the instincts of a killer without having to kill anyone. Nice!    (white to move and win)    8)Master a sport:  Probably even better than mastering a game because its the same as all of the above but you also get in shape.  If anyone can think of any other alternatives, please list them in the comments. We only have the life we have lived. And I always sit and daydream, what if..', what if..' Its the easiest and most dangerous meditation to do: what if. Because that wish is like a wisp of smoke that can twist and turn until we disappear along with it. But as I write this post I look at these alternatives with longing and I know that when I hit Publish I'm going to sit here quietly while the sun goes down, wondering only about what if'.

life is like a game heres how you master any game,"       I swept the chess pieces to the floor and ran out. The pieces were still popping around on the ground like popcorn when I left the room where the match was being played. It was my school versus some other school. I had lost.     I didn't care at all about the rest of my team. Losers.  The coach of the team, an English teacher, ran out after me but he was sort of laughing. Stop, he said. Wait.  But I didn't want to. I had lost. I was worthless. I hated myself. I hated everyone. The rest of my team was laughing. I could hear them. Laughing at me. The other team was in shock.  I am a sore loser. It's not that I'm so competitive with others. But I'm competitive with myself. I like to do better than I did before. Sometimes that means something very bad: I like to be perfect at the things I'm interested in.  Of course, it's impossible to be perfect.  I had nightmares that night. My dad opened my door at 3 in the morning and asked if I were ok. No, and there was nothing he could do.  I didn't go to school the next day or the next. I was a loser with acne and now a bad chess player.  A year later I was the highest ranking under 20 year old in my state. And then I basically stopped playing except when my life was in big transition in the 90s and then I played quite a bit.  But I played other games, during other transitions. I always played games to escape the bad things that were happening in my life.  The best games are a metaphor for life. So I would always escape my life (a bad relationship, a bad trade, a bad business, feelings of being useless, etc) by playing games.  I played a lot of the game Go, when I was burntout and about to get kicked out of graduate school.  I played a lot of poker (365 nights straight, including the night my daughter was born) when I was, well, becoming a father! I played a lot of Scrabble when I went broke. And then Hearts. And then backgammon.  There is a particular grammar to mastering a game and it's not different from the grammar of mastering anything. Once you learn how to speak one new language, it's easy to learn how to speak a third language and even easier to learn how to speak a fourth language.  I've seen this across every game player I know. Someone who is good at chess can easily master poker. Or, and I've told this story before, there's Falafel.  Around 1994 I started playing Falafel in Washington Sq Park. He was homeless and often had grass in his dirty hair from wherever it was he had been sleeping the night before.  We'd play for 50 cents a game, sometimes a dollar depending on what he could afford to risk losing. He wasn't as good as me so I'd give some odds. His name was Falafel because that is all he would eat.  Then he disappeared. It was six months before I saw him at the park again. He was smiling.  In just a few months time he had become one of the best backgammon players in the world. He had started playing Wall Street bankers in a price club on the Upper West Side. He build up to a bankroll of $800,000. Then he lost it all. Then he made it all back. A game player can't be stopped.  20 years later, I think he is now ranked #1 in the world at backgammon when comparing his moves with the moves a computer would make.  Then there was Ylon. He was a chess master (the first time we ever played, I beat him, but then he solidly has turned the table on me) who switched from chess to backgammon to poker. Now, $6mm in poker winnings later, he runs a bar in Brooklyn.  Mastering a game requires you to do the exact opposite of what everyone else does. Since 99.99% of people won't master a game you need to do the reverse to conquer them.  I don't know, maybe that above paragraph is the only rule you need to know. But I love games so much I have ten or eleven other rules.  Here's what I've learned from mastering the various games I've played:   A) LOOK AT ALL OF THE CANDIDATE MOVES'   This applies to everything: games, business, relationships, everything in life.  I see it happen in reverse too many times. People think of a what if and then go way deep down analyzing that what if as if there was a 100% chance it would happen rather than an almost 1% chance it would happen.  Like what if my wife is cheating. or what if my idea is bad or what if this marketing plan doesn't work out.  In the 1950s classic chess book, Think Like a Grandmaster Alexander Kotov's first technique is to: List all the candidate moves first.  In other words, list all the options that can happen. Don't go deeply down ANY OF THEM. Then start to look slightly deeper down each one and see which options you can quickly eliminate.  This saves you mental energy and time. This one technique raises your IQ.  It turns out, some 30 years later, this is how chess computers are programmed. The best chess computers are now solidly better than humans. The first thing a chess program does when looking at position: it lists the candidate moves.   B) DON'T TAKE TOO MANY RISKS   Games are all about taking risks.  But if you take too many risks, you always lose. In Backgammon, if you leave too many blots open, you will get hit, sent back to the bar, and eventually get blocked off the board and lose. If you play too conservatively, you'll also lose.  Trial and error tells you how many risks to take, but err on the side of not taking risks.  This is true for business also. People say to me, I have a great idea! Should I quit my job and just go for it?  Answer: NO.  Do both at the same time. I was at my fulltime job for 18 months while pursuing my side business. By the time I left my full time job to be a full time CEO of my side business I had 11 employees.  I took a lot of risks in those 18 months. But I didn't do anything that would risk losing the game.   C) LOOK FOR THE SHORT CUTS   Every game, and almost every life situation, has short cuts: ways you can get better without learning the entire literature of the game from beginning to end.  A great example is Scrabble. If you want to be the best Scrabble player in the world then it certainly helps to know all the legal words.  But if you want to be a better Scrabble player than 95% of the other Scrabble players it helps to know just two things:   all the two letter words  all the Q words without U: qat qopf qi qanat etc   and if you want to go one step further and be the coolest guy at the table, learn the six letters S A T I N E  Almost every letter you can add to those six will make a legal seven letter world. Example E. Etesian. X Antisex.  If you are home for Thanksgiving and someone breaks out the board (and has the latest official Scrabble dictionary so ZA and QI are legal) then you'll almost certainly win if you just know those two things.  What if your cousins want to play Monopoly instead? Ok, do everything you would normally do but with one difference. Buy, borrow,beg, steal, to get the Orange properties.  Trust me.   D) PLAY PEOPLE BETTER THAN YOU   You're the average of the five people you spend your time with.  When I was playing a lot, many of my friends didn't want to play me. They didn't want to lose.  I specifically wanted to play people I would lose to. Over and over again. You learn more from losing than winning. Losing is not failure. Losing gives you a treasure trove of insights into how you, personally, can get better.  When I was first starting out, I would always find people better than me. When I first moved to NY I even moved in with a player much stronger than me at chess.  We'd play all night. I got better until finally I was at least as good as him if not better (we played a match once and when he was two games down he quit the match).  If you're starting out in business, work first for a good company that has a high profit margin. This is a business run by good businessmen. Learn from them.  If you can't directly learn from them, read from them. Study what they do. Break it down. Don't wast time with the people who will bring you down.   E) LUCK FAVORS THE PREPARED   I was in a poker hand with Irv Gotti, the CEO of rap label Murder, Inc. He was laughing and everyone time I'd raise he wouldn't even hesitate before raising me again.  We were in his offices and there were two tables in a private game. The guy next to me had just produced the move 300. David Schwimmer was a regular in the game. Another guy had just sold his poker software company for $50 million. And Irv Gotti was the host. There was a lot of money around the table.  I had a great hand, Irv kept raising me. And then on the final card dealt, he got the card he needed and won the hand, and I had no money left at the game so I left.  He just got lucky, I thought. And that card was certainly lucky. But he had been in worse hands that night. He had people intimidated with his non-stop talk.  He would aggressively raise so people would be afraid to play against him because he was too unpredictable. Just those things, let him build up a bankroll where he could take more risks even in situations where the odds were against him.  I don't know how much money he made that night but I know what I left with: $0. I also found out that he took lessons from very good poker players and at that point, I hadn't played or studied in yeas.  He was more prepared than me.  Whenever you feel like saying, I was just unlucky trust me when I say, you're probably an idiot. Analyze the reality. Don't just try to make yourself feel better.  Blaming is draining.  In chess there's a saying, Only the good players get lucky. This applies to every area of life.  As Scott Adams (creator of Dilbert) said to me, if you know you're only going to succeed at 10% of the things you try, make sure you try 100 things.   F) STUDY THE HISTORY   Every game, every industry, has its history. A history of successful business models, of successful people, of styles in which the game was played. Of colorful personalities.  If you don't love the history of what want to master, then you will never master it.  Simon Rich, one of the funniest writers I have ever read, the youngest writer of SNL ever, and now working on two movies and a sitcom, said to me, if you don't wake up and want to write first thing, you probably shouldn't be writing.  In the course of our discussion he must've referred to 50 different books and comedians and movies, etc.  It's like the movie Groundhog Day. Bill Murray relives every day over and over. He becomes a better person for it.  You can't do that. You can't relive the same day. But you can relive the thousands of days before you in the area you are most interested in by studying the history of the field you love.  Writers should of course constantly read. You can't write a good book if you havn't read 500 other good books. You can't write a good screenplay if you havn't watched 100s of movies and appreciate the beauty of specific shows from the 60s, the 70s and the various eras of movies that came after that.  I don't think I know a single chess master who hasn't read through Bronstein's 1953 Zurich International tournament book at least a dozen times. Or Mikhail Tal's Best games.  Poker players have read Doyle Brunson's classic a dozen times. And entrepreneurs have all now read Walter Isaacson's book on Steve Jobs and dozens of other biographies of successful businessmen.  The history of a game or life is your virtual mentor if you don't have a direct mentor.   G) MASTER YOUR PSYCHOLOGY   I was a very bad sore loser. If I even lost one game in a tournament I would drop out.  As mentioned above, I lost one game and swept the pieces to the floor, creating a scene, and making someone else clean up after my mess. Not to mention making a fool of myself.  Failure is the hip new word. People say, you have to fail to succeed. This is not true. Failure is the fastest way to becoming a failure.  Instead, view everything as an experiment. Every experiment has problems. As Peter Thiel says, Get good at solving hard problems.  When something doesn't work out, see how you can make it 5% better the next time. There's always a next time.  If there wasn't a next time. Warren Buffett would've quit investing in 1956. Or 1957. Or 1958. Instead, almost 60 years later, he's still learning from the things he tries (and he's made many multi-billion dollar mistakes even in the past decade) and then he tries to make the next situation 5% better so he doesn't make the same mistakes.  If you love someone or something, you will have many many opportunities to kiss. If one kiss isn't perfect, then be 5% better in how you treat that person, in how you surprise, in how you learn, in how you study, and the next kiss will be love.  Better to love than to be bitter, than to think you're unlucky, than to not be prepared, then to not delight the people around you.   H) TEWARI ANALYSIS   This is a trick in a game called, Go. Which happens to be the most popular board game in the world but many in the US don't know about it because it's popular in Japan, Korea, and China.  No computer can play Go. It's too difficult. Much more difficult than chess. And when I play through a game played by two professionals it's almost like they are not playing a game but mutually creating a new work of art that takes my breath away.  I used to take lessons from a guy who had been the Chinese Amateur Champion a year or so earlier.  I would make a move and he would shake his head. He knew one English word. No.  Then he would show me why. He would take off the last few moves made and then recreate the position but put the pieces down as if we had made the moves in a different order.  Then a light would shine, Ahh! Because if I had made the move I was planning, in the exact same position but as if the moves leading up to that position were in a different order, then it suddenly was clear why my move was bad.  Example: someone wrote to me the other day that they had made $50 million dollars when they were very young. Then very quickly, the person had lost $30 million and was feeling horrible.  Tewari analysis would say: Well, what if you had simply gone from $0 to $20 million, rather than from $0 to $50 million and then down to $20 million?  You would be in the exact same situation, but you probably wouldn't feel horrible.  Our minds give great weight to the perception of motion. The way to get around this is to rewire the mind to show that forward motion was still there, it just doesn't seem that way because of how you were perceiving it.  Change your perception of motion and you change your potential for happiness.   I) PLAY THE CARDS IN FRONT OF YOU   One time I was playing poker at a club and Norm McDonald, the comedian, came in and started playing. He was a funny guy so there was a lot of chatter at the table.  Norm would play every hand. Normally in poker you're probably dealt two hands an hour that are worth playing, and chances are you'll lose at last 50% of those hands.  But Norm played and raised and played and raised. He had a beautiful girl with him and it was no fun for him if he wasn't in the hand.  So he lost all his money and then got more money out and then lost that and eventually left.  Someone said afterwards, when Norm comes here it's like a vacuum cleaner on his wallet.  Too many people don't have the right preparation. They haven't tested their product. They haven't studied the game they are in. But they play as if they are already on top. It's not such a bad strategy to fake it til you make it. But make sure nobody knows you are doing that.  The short cut in poker: don't bluff. If you have a good hand, play it. Count on the fact that someone else will bluff and you will make a lot of money.  If you have pieces in chess that aren't at their full potential (for example, there is a saying, a knight on the rim is dim) then play your cards by figuring out how to make that knight stronger in the next few moves.  Don't go for a full out attack on the other person's king when your pieces are not really in place for it. Too many people do that.  Just play what is in front of you. Improve incrementally and be PATIENT. You will have your chance to win many times. But you will lose ALL of your chances if you waste them.   J) A BAD PLAN IS BETTER THAN NO PLAN   Peter Thiel told me that on our podcast. He was referring to business. Guess what? Peter Thiel is also a very strong chess master and the saying A bad plan is better than no plan is a saying in chess.  Having a bad plan gives you several things:   realization that you need a plan  opportunities to see if that plan is not working  ways to analyze when the plan goes awry  a chance to change the plan if it's not working.   Having no plan gives you none of these opportunities to get better.   K) Maybe most important: THE THREAT IS STRONGER THAN THE EXECUTION   I remember studying a match in, I think, 1984, between the British chess champion, Nigel Short, and the US Champion, Lev Alburt.  The British Champion wiped him out. I'm not going to google it but I think the final score was 9-1.  When I studied the games I noticed that the British champion was constantly bothering the US champion. He would make non-stop, but frivolous threats, against Lev Alburt's queen.  Alburt wasn't going to lose his queen but he had to waste a move getting his queen safe. Eventually Nigel Short would have the better position because he had gained so much time by threatening non-stop.  Microsoft always announces software years before it's done. This is called vaporware but nobody really knows whether or not there vaporware will become real or not so this often dissuades competitors.  H. Ross Perot used to buy up shares of a big company (for instance, GM) and start shouting how poorly the company was run and that he could do a better job. He wasn't really going to take over the company but many people thought he was because of his threats and they would start buying up shares.  Then he would sell his shares after they had run up significantly (or a company like GM would pay him off in a process called greenmail) and he would make a lot of money.    I love games. Any game. And, for me, studying the subtleties of games are like studying a bible. The metaphors to life are so real that I've learned to live my life by the above rules.  Recently, Claudia and I have been playing an Argentinian card game called Truco. We can play for hours. Half of the time she is screaming (she will deny this but I have a positive score against her).  I can see there is a lot of strategy in the game. But the game is VERY Argentinian. For instance, if I google strategy for Truco, it doesn't give me the strategic tips I expect. It just says to joke and talk louder than your opponent so they get distracted.  This strikes me as typical Argentina, a country settled hundreds of years ago by pirates escaping the law rather than by Puritans escaping religious persecution.  Truco is actually a beautiful game and I love it's subtleties.  But when we are done playing, ultimately I love the person I am playing with.  This is how you master the game of life.     "
the ultimate guide to changing your life,"    Ugh, then there are those times when I feel dead inside. I wake up early and swing on the pre-school swingset like a pervert.  The sun rises and instead of being orange and blue and beautiful it's white and glaring and it's a terrible terrible sunrise, burning everything inside of me.  Another day.  This is what happens to me when change is being born. At least for me: I've never avoided any of these steps.  A) SOMETHING'S MISSING  You don't know what it is. But it's like you left something at home. Maybe the stove on. Or a book you were supposed to read. Or a key that opens a door you forgot about.  It's a bloating. A constipation of life that just won't get digested until it wears you down, makes it hard to move, forces your face closer to the grind that will kill you.  When I spoke with David Levien he told me about his commute to work. Seeing the people asleep or reading the paper and he felt that sense of being bloated.  The feeling of Will I fall asleep?  So on the commute he wrote a page a day of what became a bestselling novel.  Albert Einstein was dying from the rigid eight hour day at the patent office. He was so bored he was even denied his first attempt at getting a promotion.  He would try to dig out the crevices that time had carved into his routine so he could work on his own theories of magic, since the magic of today always becomes the science of tomorrow.  I was told all the time in my 20s, you have to pay your dues. I was told this by people with some higher rank than me. As if they had paid their dues.  But one man's rank is another man's stank.  You pay your dues when you finally come to that realization that something is missing.  That whatever they told you in the past: your religion, your parents, your friends, your bosses  is wrong. Not for them. Since who knows the price of another's life.  But for you.  The dues are when you find your authentic voice. The singing voice that stands out in the world chorus. Paying the dues is when you open up that voice to its full range.  When you sing.  B) DESPERATION  I realized something was missing but didn't know what to do.  I thrashed. I would read books. I would see which people I would want to model myself after. I would study them.  I'd write ideas down each day.  I'd cry because these were the times I was most lonely, when one group was disappearing and another set of friends and colleagues had yet to find me.  Trust that the desperation will go away. You'll find people to love. You'll write ideas down every day. I finally learned to be grateful for my desperation. This is the egg that will crack open and give birth to new life.  It's going to happen many times. Even every day.  Go forth and multiply.  C) TOTAL CONFUSION  When you speak in that authentic voice for the first time, you say words you never said before. Maybe nobody has ever said them. You're going to scare the people around you.  You're going to scare yourself. Because people close to you will react.  You might be wrong. When you write the first page of the novel, you can't possibly know how it will end. When you start a business, not a single person in the world can predict the outcome.  Odeo is always my favorite example. Started by a guy who had built a hundred million dollar company previously. Everyone trusted his idea was good. A platform for podcasting. Huge idea!  Many great investors invested. But no customers. One of his employees started a side project. Sending messages back and forth. He got 10,000 users. A small amount.  The founder offered all of the investors a chance to get their money back. 100% of them accepted. The founder then changed the name of the company to the side project.  All the best investors in the world missed out on investing in Ev Williams' new project, Twitter.  The world is changing very quickly. In a few years, your 3D printed car (your 3D printed food) will be dropped off at your house maybe every month.  Companies like Coursera and Khan Academy and Udemy will destroy overpriced colleges. AirBnB will end the need for hotels. New technologies in batteries will end our reliance on the pervasive grid.  There's no answer. There's no guru who can say what will happen. I've started 20 businesses and watched and cried while 17 of them failed. I'm divorced and have lost two homes. Many friends I love, no longer love me.  When the tide shifts, it's too hard to figure out what companies will go down with it. I've seen many billion dollar companies fail within a matter of weeks or months. The only thing common among all of them: lack of character at the top.  You build character by remaining calm in the confusion.  Sometimes I haven't been able to do this. One time my mother said to me, I can't believe you are my son.  Character is a hard thing to cultivate. At least for me. But it's possible for everyone. This is also called, Paying your dues.  D) SELF-SABOTAGE  Two different friends of mine are self-sabotaging themselves right this second in two very different companies.  I can't tell them because what do I know? But they will do it.  When I was a kid, the world's record for losing the most amount of money in one day was held by a young man named Ross Perot. If I remember right, in 1969 he lost a billion in a day when the stock market fell.  He said much later, Most people give up just when they're about to achieve success. They quit on the one yard line. They give up at the last minute of the game one foot from a winning touchdown.  I didn't used to believe in self-sabotage. I thought that was an excuse. But now I see how it happens.  You're so close but you're afraid to take the chance and disappoint people. You say later, I was just being honest or I couldn't take the chance.  I self-sabotage myself all the time when I'm afraid to disappoint someone else. Or when I'm not honest about my real feelings and desires I tend to mix them up so badly until it's all a big mess. Or when I think I don't deserve the good fortune that I've worked for.  Why wouldn't I think I deserve it? That seems fake. I have no clue. But it's true. Somewhere deep inside there's a hole and it can't be filled except by sabotage.  Recognizing it, noticing it, working around it, is the third step on the path to change.  E) ANXIETY  The other day I had to give a talk. Everyone was smart and successful and knew more than me about the topic of the conference.  What could I teach them? How could I start to get their attention?  A friend of mine is working on a company that has a technology for detecting what part of the country every strand of marijuana comes from. He explained some of the science to me. I mildly misinterpreted it to start my speech.  Did you know marijuana plant has both a penis and a vagina, I started my talk with. And then explained what I meant. Then related it back to the topic: marketing. People laughed. But I had been afraid.  I died in another talk. Everyone in the audience was very successful. So I gulped down a can of coke but didn't swallow the coke. Instead I walked on stage and pretended to throw up. Dead silence.  I have to go to a big meeting next week. I am helping a company and maybe millions of dollars are at stake. Will I look too weird? Will I have nothing to say? Will I say the wrong thing?  Anxiety is the doorknob. The doorway leads to change. But you have to open the doorknob first.  F) SOMEONE LISTENS  David Levien wrote his book on his commute. His best friend read it and loved it. Kay Cannon wrote her script on the subway over three years. A studio then made it into a movie.  Einstein slaved away in the patent office and wrote e=mc squared. A physics journal decided to publish that equation from a third level patent clerk.  Frank McCourt, now a bestselling author, wrote his first book in his 60s. His memoir, Angela's Ashes. Someone agreed to publish it.  Guess what? 35% of entrepreneurs last year started their first business at the age of 50 or older.  Lisa Gable had never started a company before. At the age of 70 she got disgusted with her falling bra-straps. She made a bra strap that help everything up. Strap-mate, now a multi-million dollar company.  Coolio wrote lyrics every day for 17 years in a row before having a single hit. Someone finally listened. Somehow his voice stopped imitating others and became his own.  At some point you've paid the dues and everything begins to pay off. You begin to get that return. People listen. You stood out and everyone hated you but then fight through that and now you begin to have an impact.  G) SLOW DOWN  When you find your voice, slow down. There's no rush. Out of six billion people, you're the only one with your voice, your experiences, your ideas, your wisdom. There's no competition to be you.  Someone once complimented Arthur Rubinstein on his piano playing. He said, It's not the piano playing. I handle the notes no better than anyone else does. It's the pauses  that's where art resides.  When your change kicks in. This is the moment not to plan for the future, but to find the pauses in the present.  This is what makes or break the person who surfs the world of change. Too often I rushed into the future and fell off the cliff, with all my limbs broken.  I wish I had done this: respect the pause, respect the people around me, respect that I have to write down ideas every day, be grateful that I got to this step.  Gratitude fights the gravity that tries to pull you down and prevent you from taking the next step.  When you slow down, everything lasts longer.  H) EVERYTHING CYCLES  When I follow my own advice, my life changes almost completely every six months.  But often things go really bad. A few months ago, a company I was involved in fell apart. There was corruption. Things got ugly.  I was so disappointed. I didn't see it coming. I hit a low point. Low points and high points happen in every creature on the planet except in our Facebook feeds.  You have to know in a low point that it's time to rest a bit. At a high point you act. At a low point you rest.  This doesn't mean turn on the TV. Turning on the TV turns off the rest of the world.  Do the opposite. Turn on the rest of the world by being with people you love, finding the gratitude that is ALWAYS buried in difficult situations, writing down ideas every day (one in 100 might even be good).  I was at a low point and had a hard time getting out of bed. Until finally I told myself, this is the perfect time to follow my own stories.  And so I did. And then things got better. I wrote 20 things I learned from the experience. I figured out how to turn the death of this psychic murder into the birth of a new life for me.  I) FIND YOUR TEACHERS  When you change, it's like you've walked through a portal and entered a new world.  In this new world, you need teachers to show you the way. You can find your teachers in real life. You can find them through books. You can spy on them and model your life after their examples.  Everything that happens to you, every person you encounter was sent specifically by the mad scientists who created this virtual reality to teach you. Their methods are insidious and not out of the standard textbook so you can't be fooled. But learn.  Eventually you pass them as you further develop your voice, as the world now becomes something not that you entered but something that you impacted and changed. Now it's your world and you are the teacher.  J) REPEAT  It never ends.    Paying your dues has nothing to do with working hard. It has nothing to do with the failure porn so common right now.  It has everything to do with that terrible white sunrise. The one you didn't want to happen. The one that wakes you up while everyone else is still asleep.     "
10 more reasons why parents should not send their kids to college,"    OK, enough is enough. In 2006 I wrote an article for The Financial Times on why I won't send my kids to college. I've written, more or less, the same article for several publications including AOL, Yahoo, one of my last books (I forget which one) and the Washington Post wrote an article on my opinions on the subject.   Here is my most recent article on why you shouldn't send your kids to college .  I hate to admit it, but I don't really like anyone to disagree with me. I like 100% agreement to all of my proclamations. When I wake up in the morning, I want to open the newspaper and see big headlines, JAMES ALTUCHER WAS RIGHT AGAIN! and quotes in the articles like, Why are we always so stupid? Why don't we listen to James the first time he says things? Maybe when I walk outside I want people to throw flowers down on the street in front of me and beggars and homeless people to run up to me and say, I might be homeless but I love the way you think. If possible, can I touch you?     But I don't like to be touched so I would hold up my hand, take out a pad, write down some words of wisdom, rip out the piece of paper from the pad and hand it to them.  So it disturbs me when people cling to the notion of going to college like its the holiest water down from God, come to bless them. Seriously, you could walk around and say, Jesus never lived, and people nod their heads and say, ok, there is religious freedom in America and what he just said is fine, but if you say kids should not go to college its like you breached the highest, holiest, divine hymen of American religion.  Say it again. Say it loud and proud: college is the divine hymen of American religion.  One person wrote on a Yahoo message board (where the elite post their thoughts):  the government should take his kids away. Please, that would be great for me. Maybe I can visit my kids on holidays inside their government compounds. I hear that inside the Department of Commerce there are lots of jungle gyms my kids could play on. And there are 3D video games projected onto the walls of the State Department where Chelsea Clinton's future kids will play. But until then, my kids who were taken from me by G-Force Government Agents can play the games. When Chelsea Clinton's kids are old enough my kids can babysit them. That would help them build their rolodex for when they later on want to work at hedge funds or the world famous US Department of State.  Another person wrote:  Mr. Altucher, who went to his prestigious ivy league school, wants to now keep everyone underneath him so he can reap the benefits of their poverty. Yes, I admit it. I need everyone to be less educated than me so I can feel good about myself. If you didn't go to the same school as me then its a gurantee you are less intelligent than me. As I write this I see I misspelled guarantee in the sentence before mine. I'm not even going to correct it. Because in the next version of the American Dictionary they will include gurantee and say as the definition: see guarantee' . Because thats the way I roll.  Ok, those were the spurious disagreements with my article. I don't even honor them with an official number, like many of those list blogs that people hate. But now I'm going to make a list blog anyway. Who cares?  10 More Reasons Parents Should Not Send Their Kids to College   1. People say: Kids learn to be socialized at college.  Are you kidding me? I'm going to spend $100-200k a year so my kids can learn how to make friends with other people their age? Let me tell you about how your kids will be socialized in college and you know this to be true:  -Your kid should put a dime in a glass jar every time he or she has sex in his first year of college. After the first year of college, he or she should take a dime out every time they have sex. They will never empty that jar. I might be exaggerating (its hard for me to do the math on numbers in four digits like this when I look back at my own experience). So assume that's step #1 on the socialization of our children in college.  Do the same exercise above with the dimes but replace sex with vomit. Thats part #2 with the socialization.  You can also do the above exercise with the dimes (give your kid lots of dimes before they say, ok, Dad, see you LATER! when you drop them off in the parking lot of college.) but instead of sex or vomit say classes I will skip because of either sex or vomiting.   2. People say: Kids learn how to think in college.  This argument was said to me by Kathryn Schulz, author of Being Wrong, a good friend and author of an excellent book. But she knows more than anyone that no matter how much you think you think, you're going to be wrong most of the time. And by the way, does it really cost several hundred thousand dollars to learn how to think?  I would argue that college is a way to avoid learning how to think. If I want to learn how to play tennis, the best thing to do is go out on a tennis court and play tennis. If I want to learn how to drive a car, I better get behind a wheel and drive. If I want to learn how to live and how to think, then the best thing to do is begin living my life and thinking my thoughts instead of still having my parents pay for my life and my professors giving me my thoughts. See below to see how I learned how to think.  In a related blog post, I will also write ways people can learn how to think.   3. Statistics say: College graduates make much more money than non-college graduates.  Clearly anyone who states this has failed Statistics 101 in college. We might know correlation but we don't know cause-and-effect here. Since our generation (post-baby boomer) basically everyone goes to college except people who absolutely failed high school, then of course it makes sense that achievement-minded people make more money than individuals who are not achievement-oriented.  A better statistical study, which nobody has done, is take 2000 people who got accepted to Harvard 20 years ago, and randomly force 1000 of them to not go to college. Then, at the end of 20 years to see who made more money. My guess is that the 1000 who didn't go to Harvard would've made more money. They would've been thrown out of the nest to learn how to fly that much earlier and a 5 year head start would've made enormous difference (I say 5 years because thats the average amount of time it takes to finish college. Not 4, as many think).   4. One person said:   Not everything boils down to money.  Specifically, one brilliant commenter on one of my posts said, I'd say the overwhelming majority of people don't go to college as a financial investment. They do it because they want to explore career options in an easy environment. They do it because there's a particular career they want to be (unfortunately weekend hackers don't often become doctors) They do it because they want to drink and party on the weekends. They do it because the point of life is not making money.  I'm going to be angry for the first time on this post, if not this entire blog since its inception. What a stupid statement that is. If its not a financial investment then why has the cost of college gone up 1000% in the same amount of time its taken healthcare to go up 700% and inflation to go up 300%? Its a financial investment because college presidents have scammed most kids into thinking they can't get jobs without college. So they jack up the prices knowing kids will be forced to pay otherwise suffer the perceived opportunity cost of not going to college.  Also, the commenter above says the point of life is not making money. I'd like to thank him for saying that. Otherwise i would've gone through life thinking the entire point of life was making money. I'm assuming what he really means by that statement is that its great for kids to read books about philosophy, literature, art, history, etc in an environment that encourages discussion among peers and experts. This is what college is truly great for.     5.  My Experience.  I think of myself as an educated person so let me tell you my own experience:  College itself was spent:   meeting and fooling around with girls for the first time in my life. I'm glad the banks loaned me enough money to do this. And fortunately, extreme failure and embarrassment in this arena didn't effect me at all later in life.  learning about alcohol and the occasional recreational drug for the first time in my life  I took an enormous amount of classes in Computer Science. None of which helped me in my first actual non-academic job. In fact, I was so bad at computers after going to both undergrad Cornell in Computer Science and graduate school at Carnegie Mellon in Computer Science that my first non-academic job (HBO) had to send me to two months of training courses at AT&amp;T so I could learn a thing or two about how computers were used in the real world. My first task at HBO was to get some computer they gave me onto the Internet. I ended up crashing the computer so bad they had to throw it out and I also wiped out everyone's email on that computer. I thought they were going to fire me but they just banished me for two months instead. The only way to get fired at HBO, I was told, was to stand on your boss's desk and pee on it.  I borrowed every penny of my college education. I took courses every summer (they were cheaper and quicker then) and I took six courses a semester. I still graduated without about 30-40k in loans. It took me ten years (and selling a business) but I paid back every penny of my loans.  On top of my courses, I worked about 40 hours a week at jobs so I could afford my expenses. My parents did not pay one dime of my expenses except for maybe my first semester of college. And for graduate school I got a full scholarship and stipend.   The way I got educated in reading, philosophy, history, art, etc. was fully on my own time. After leaving graduate school I took relatively easy jobs as a programmer on campus. I spent hours every day reading books, and then at least another hour or two a day going to the campus library and reading criticism on the books I had just finished.  This was the entirety of my liberal arts education. And it was all for free and has served me well since then. And I was actually paid while I was doing it.  If you can't read a book without being on a college campus and paying $100-200k a year for the honor of being there then you probably shouldn't be reading books anyway. Or at least wait until you learn the value of a dollar before making that extreme expense.  6.  Parents are scammed.  If you are a parent and wish to send your kids to a college then, just to summarize, here is what you are paying for:   your kids are going to have sex 1- 5 times a day with people you probably wouldn't approve of.  your kids are going to drink, smoke pot, probably try LSD and other drugs before you even get home  your kids are going to cheat on most of their exams. When I first started college I wanted to be a psychologist. I read every book on psychology. In Psych 101 I got a D- on my first exam, which was graded on a curve. Apparently the other 2000 kids in the class had access to older exams which were stored at all the fraternities and the professor never changed the exams. I had to ultimately drop Psych as a major. My dad said, why do you want to major in Psychology anyway. Girls won't like you because you won't make any money as a psychologist. I said, but then I'll never know if the girls like me for money or not? And he said, Girls won't like you because you have money. They'll like you because YOU ARE THE KIND OF GUY who can make a lot of money.  your kids are going to make connections with other like-minded individuals (people focused on drugs, socialism, sex 24 hours a day (not a bad thing), people cheating on exams, and people with rich parents who will help your kids get jobs at Goldman Sachs).  your kids are going to think they are smarter than you almost immediately.  while you are working 60 hours a week and borrowing money to send your kids to college, your kids will be sleeping good chunks of the day, relaxing on the weekends, and enjoying the blissful pleasures of the lazy life for another four years until the real world hits.    7.Alternatives.  See my just-published post on  alternatives to college   And by the way, I know my title said 10 Reasons and I only listed 7. I didn't learn to count in college. But maybe you can help me fill out three more reasons in the comments. I had a great time in college. And although I worked very hard I managed to enjoy the beautiful nature around Ithaca and really appreciate being away from home. I graduated a year early so I could save on tuition. In order to graduate early I had to maintain at least a 3.0 average. Unfortunately, on the last day of classes I realized I was heading for a 2.999 and would not be able to graduate. I had to go to my Fortran (blech!) professor and beg him to upgrade me from a D+ and a C-. Fortunately, he did. And I got my degree.

the 10 commandments of the american religion,"    If I stand in the center of Times Square New York City and said something like Moses didn't part the Red Sea or Jesus never existed everyone would just keep walking around me, ignoring what I said, etc. Whatever, they would be thinking, I have things to do, very important things that have to get done. And this guy is clearly crazy so not worth my time.  But if I stood there and said, going to college is the worst sin you can force your kids to commit, or you should never vote again or World War II was not a holy war or never own a home again, I would probably be lynched on the spot.  The American Religion is a fickle and false religion. Used to replace the ideologies we (a country of immigrants) escaped from with tenets that don't withstand the test of time. With random high priests lurking all over the Internet, ready to pounce. Below are some of the tenets of the American Religion. If you think there are more, list them in the comments.     For me: I'm not religious. I want to be happy. Every day I want  to do things that increase the odds of my happiness  and quality of life. Every day I want to do things that  reduce the obstacles  to my happiness. That's it. Nothing more.   The Ten Commandments of the American Religion    -#1     Own a Home.  The American Religion wants you to have a home with a white picket fence. Why would the high priests of the American religion want that?   So then you owe the banks money for 30 years or more (after second, third, fourth mortgages). The banks need to borrow from your checking account at 0.5% and then lend right back to you at 8%. That's how they make money and its one of the largest industries in the country.  So you are not flexible as to where you can move. The job market is ruled by supply and demand. Supply of jobs in an area is finite. So they want to make sure you can't move so quickly so that demand only goes up (you can't move and more and more people hit the age of 18 or higher)  Note that many people equate owning a home with having roots. Its as if owning a home connects you in some immortal way with the 3 billion year old planet. Your roots are now connected to it. It's linking home ownership with the fear of death that every religion attempts to assuage (through heaven, reincarnation, etc).  [See,  Why I would Rather Shoot Myself In the head than Ever Own a Home Again. ]        #2     Go to college.  There's the myth that going to college leads to a better life or a promised future. Almost like how the contract Abraham had with God would lead to Judaism being a group of chosen people. A couple of points:   Statistically, there's no proof that smart, ambitious, aggressive people, won't benefit enormously from a five year head start against their peers who choose to spend five years doing homework and drinking beer and going to frat parties. (don't quote me the stat about the differences in salaries between college grads and non-college grads because there's enormous selection bias in that stat and its like comparing apples and oranges right now).  The government needs to pay off $74 trillion in Social Security in the next 50 years. They have to make money somehow so student loan debt is now higher than credit card debt for the first time in 50 years. Imagine that, we send our young, fresh, children off to college and then 5 years later (5 years is average time spent in college by those who GRADUATE) they come out owing the government $100,000+. Thank god the government gets to exploit our kids so they can pay off the promises they made under Lyndon Johnson during the Vietnam War.  There are so many exciting alternatives to college.  I list some of them here.  I'm excited for my children, because I hope they have experiences that will change their lives forever rather than sending them into the rat race so they can end up ignorant, in debt, and working at nonsense jobs so they can pay off the gangsters who have guns pointed right at their heads.  One anecdote: the guy who caught Derek Jeter's 3000 th  hit. He was a young man in the stadium. He's a salesclerk at Verizon. I have nothing against that job. Anyone can do what they want. But he also has $150,000 in student loans to pay back. Why couldn't he get a better job with his college degree? Why did he just give Jeter his ball back. Jeter is going to make $100 million in the next few years. This guy could've paid his loans back and been free.  Freedom  is everything. He wanted to be a good guy.  The American Religion needs you to be in debt. Needs you to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to read the same Plato you could've read in the bathroom at your local library. You'll have a better life. life is secure now. Yes, you are fully secured by the shackles they hand you on graduation day.  [See,  Living Life Is Better than Dying in College ]    #3     Holy Wars . Everyone argued with me in my post about  Name me a war that was worth it . Apparently some wars are holy and can't be argued against. All I want is to prevent 18 year old kids from dying. That's the basis of my argument. We can argue all the history we want after that. No matter what the war is, I will never send my 18 year olds off to war. I'd rather go in their place if there was a forced draft.  We can all agree Vietnam was no good. Korea was probably no good. Iraq was no good. But are other wars holy and justified. When other countries (UK, for instance) released their slaves in 1833 we had to fight a war to release the slaves. And note that the slaves weren't released until 1862, when Lincoln, who could care less about them, was afraid we were going to lose the Civil War, a war fought over whether or not the North could still control the tariffs of the Southern cotton when the Southern states seceded (as was their right). And if we had never fought the Revolutionary War (a war fought over Sam Adams' taxes) Britain would've set aside money to buy out all of the US slaves in 1833. Both wars were senseless. And what about WW II? Time had Hitler as Man of the Year in 1938. What a bunch of fools we were and still are.  No matter what the argument is: don't send 18 year old children to their death. If you want to fight a war, go yourself and fight it, or be willing to admit you would fight it at the age of 40.      (no good. the actual caption of what happened here is too horrible to think about)    -#4     The US Constitution.  There's no document more sacred (as it should be) in the American Religion. And yet, just like the principles of the Bible are often forgotten by its highest adherents, ditto goes twice over for the US constitution. For instance, who has the power to declare war? The House of Representatives according to the Constitution. The House hasn't declared war on anyone since 1941. The US Constitution is HOLY HOLY HOLY in the American Religion. Until those moments when we break the rules. Then everyone looks the other way. We had to do it that way, is the common refrain. To protect our way of life. Someone is always protecting me and my way of life. I'm fine thank you.  [See my post:  July 4 is a Scam ]      #5     Charity . Because the American religion, unlike most religions, doesn't have a strict code of ethics giving to charity is often considered the sign of a good person. A couple of points on that.   Giving to charity costs money. So the best people in the American Religion then are the ones who have the most money to give.  Volunteering is more and more difficult for people who have to pay back student loans and exorbitant home loans. Good luck volunteering when your children need to be fed or when you are an indentured servant thanks for your advanced learning in the ivory tower.  Let's go over the math of every dollar you spend on charity. When you give $100 to a major charity, most of that goes into the bank. They then invest the money. On the interest they make on their investments, a percentage of that money goes to actual charity, another percentage goes to salaries. So for every dollar you give to charity, about 2 cents a year, give or take, goes to the actual charitable cause you wanted to support. Now lets break that down even further. How many charities have executives making over $500,000 a year. A lot. And lets say it's a medical charity. Now most of the money is going towards drugs that costs billions of dollars to approve. See the next point.  [See my post:  A Better Way to Donate to Charity]      #6      The Food &amp; Drug Administration. What is this organization? Is it in the constitution? Does it do any good? The FDA requires that drugs go through trials to prove their safety and effectiveness. That sounds good right? Before you give an 80 year old man a drug for cancer lets make sure it doesn't kill him. Meanwhile lets send 18 year olds off to wars that the Constitution hasn't approved of since 1941.  It costs billions of dollars to build those trials and the FDA can shut you down at any point. Companies raise those billions from charities and from individual investors, who usually lose all of their money when the FDA shuts down a trial. But whats the solution?  Well, we have the internet now. We have social media. We have word of mouth on steroids. That's what technology and innovation is for. Lets get the drugs out there. We can all see what scientists worked on them and what their backgrounds are, we can all read the patents, we can read real-life experiences from people using the drug. The Internet will conduct virtual trials. Will people die? Yeah, but people die in FDA trials also. Will more lives be saved? Of course! Many drug companies just give up (they can't raise the money even if their drugs are miracle drugs). Now they can get those drugs out there and we can really see. I want the FDA out of my body and let me ingest whatever I want, particularly if I have a terminal disease.    #7      Voting .  When I wrote the other day that I don't vote  I got quite a bit of violent email. That I was somehow ruining the country. Really? I live in New York. So I know my vote is meaningless no matter which way I vote. And I'm tired voting for congressmen who supposedly represent my interests but then make deals with lobbyists, other congressmen, for bridges to nowhere, and then gets hired as vice chairman of Goldman Sachs after he retires after years of government service. I'm fine representing my own interests and I'd rather vote directly on issues.  Why can't I just vote on the Internet? I can read all about the issues there. I can vote directly on bills, presidents, wars, drugs, whatever I want. If I can vote directly on issues, instead of sending a representative in my place, the costs of lobbying will go from the millions to the billions. Maybe things would actually get done in this country. In the article below I explain why all the initial reasons for the legislative branch of congress (as it stands now) are obsolete. And the beauty of the US Constitution is that it can change.  [See my post,  Politics is a Scam  Why I Will Never Vote Again ]        #8      Political parties.  We've basically had 2 parties for the past 200 years. With occasional offshoots. I don't believe in any parties. Even tea parties, libertarians, democrats, republicans, etc. It's all ways for a select few to push through an agenda that is going to change constantly over the years anyway. This is not a new opinion. Most people hate the two-party system. So let's change it.  Again, with the Internet, I'd rather be a one-man party and just vote for what I want on every issue. I'm perfectly willing to read about the issues of the day and vote directly. I don't need to have my congressman represent me. How many ethics scandals are going on in Washington DC right now? And, how many should be going on that we don't even know about? I'll tell you how much: A LOT. How do I know? I know.     #9    The media is the Fourth Branch.  There's this weird idea that's developed over the past fifty years (enouraged by the success of Robert Redford playing Bob Woodward in All The President's Men) that the media is somehow a check on the other three branches of government. This is ridiculous but people still don't get it.  A few months ago everyone was getting panicked that radiation from Japan was going to get washed up on the shores of San Francisco. Did that happen? Of course not. But the media doesn't apologize for the thousands of people who got sick taking iodine pills, or who spent weeks away from supposedly radioactive areas.  Then last week was the whole debt ceiling scare and will America default. Every week there is a new fear. I obviously don't think the media should be shut down. But there certainly should be a greater sense of responsibility than simply scaring the hell out of people with a new topic every. single. week. I am so bored of the fear of the week. I'd rather watch Snooki all day long then another fear of the week analysis from the pseudo-experts who are desperate for screen time.     [See,  How Snooki Can Help Stop Violent and Sex-Crazed Children ]       #10   The Frontier.  My kid has to read about Lewis And Clark this summer as she prepares to go into the fourth grade. The frontier is a very beautiful, almost spiritual concept. The idea that we can always expand, always improve. For the first several hundred years after the Europeans took over the United States we expanded into every unmapped territory.   What Went Wrong with the frontier?   We're missing out on the more subtle points of the word Frontier. For the past several decades we've expanded into the frontier of technology, creating everything from computers, to rockets that go to the moon, to the Internet, and many cures for many diseases (polio, smallpox, etc). But now our innovators, technologists, and creators have to pay down their homeowner debt, their credit card debt, their student loan debt. They have to vote for people who never truly represent them and get us further and further into trouble. The government puts more and more hurdles in front of our creators.  Who knows what further twists and warps the American religion will take to destroy us more than we've already been destroyed. At the end of the physical frontier is the ocean and we're all being pushed into it until American and everyone in it drowns.  I love this country. But I get sad when I see all of the above. When 18 year olds are sent to get killed while 60 year olds can't get the drugs they need to survive. Where the government and banks and even charities take all my money. Where commercialism in its worst form conspires to take the remaining dollars of my salary.   I'm not political.  I'm not in any party nor do I believe in any political philosophy. For me, I believe in the impossible. That change, even at a mass level, only comes from the inside of each individual. That if each person tries to remain  physically healthy, emotionally healthy, mentally health, and spiritually health y, then the country itself will rise to new heights never seen before in the civilization of man.  A height without mythology, without the dream of immortality, without fantasy notions of a better life that turn out to be just lies. Without deeper and more complicated mechanisms to control the masses. Where mediocrity is not rewarded with power over the creators. I'm asking for too much.  Today I'm going to do what I always do. And it has nothing to do with anything in this article.     Related Posts:    The Daily Practice    Follow me o n Twitter       "
how to deal with crappy people,"    Ugh, I'm disgusted with my brain. I see people walking down the street and there's like this killer inside me providing running nasty commentary about each person. Do you do this also?  I have to stop myself often: you don't know this person who is randomly crossing the street. You can't possibly know that he's a cheating lying rich Hamptons-worshipping whoremongering obnoxious trust fund baby with a 17 year old mistress on the side who doesn't wipe, who doesn't wash, who would wish nothing better than to see you die.  You can't know that! So why do I think it? Most people crossing the street probably think that about me also. Who is that freak? Is he homeless? Why can't he comb his hair? Why is his fly open? Is he a child molesting pervert?  Most people are pretty crappy. But not all. And even the ones who are no good and not worthy of your time need a system for you to use so YOU can be happier and leave this lecherous gossipy crack addict thats in your head on the road and kick him or her to the curb.        There are only four types of people.  If you understand in advance how to deal with each of these four types you will be infinitely happier. Ultimately, interacting with the four types in the way I describe below will make one fit firmly into the first type, however difficult it is. That's the goal. You don't want to go through life unhappy.  There is no path to happiness. Happiness is the path.  In an earlier article on my blog I gave my own Daily Practice that has helped me out of every tough situation in my life  for the past 15 years (when I've been disciplined enough to apply it).   It has 4 legs . Many of us focus in our daily lives on only one of the legs (Physical, Emotional, Mental, or Spiritual) but we need all the legs in balance to really sit down at the dinner table without falling.  The Practice works and brings one from the brink to success and then more success. I believe in it more than I've ever believed in any hocus-pocus anything ever.  But to develop the emotional leg of that practice takes a lot of work and I've written nothing on this. Probably because it's the hardest. In my talks people ask about the Mental side, the idea muscle. But the Emotional side, equally as important, is much harder.  The key is to identify the FOUR types of people and discipline yourself on how you should approach these people.  The Four Types of People   #1 Happy . There are people who are genuinely happy in the world. Sure they have their suffering. Everyone does. But a lot of people really are pretty satisfied with their lives at this very moment.  A natural reflex (not for everyone, but certainly for some people) is to resent people for being happy. Who doesn't do that some of the time? Raise your hand!  Let's say someone lives in 20,000 square foot house in Connecticut, has a sexy wife (or sexy husband), and is genuinely happy. It's hard not to resent such a person. This resentment will block the  Daily Practice  from having beneficial outcomes in your life. In 2002 when I was pitching hedge fund managers to invest money with me I often ran into the exact person described above. And their families. The sexy wives in short shorts. The hedge fund managers served gourmet meals for lunchtime by loving cooks.   (Stevie Cohen's house. Here's  How Stevie Cohen Changed My Life )  You can't fake resentment. You can't put on a mask. If someone is at a costume ball, you can easily see they are wearing a mask. You have to genuinely be happy for these people.  It's so hard to grab a single ounce of happiness in this world, please be happy for the ones who are happy today. Train your mind to be sincerely happy for their happiness. Catch your resentments and jealousies before they turn into monsters.  Carrie Fisher once said, nobody wants to read about a good looking happy person. She was making a commentary on comedy screenwriting and she's probably right about that. But for you to go from success to success you must first be sincerely happy for the people who are happy around you. Like attracts. Picture all the people you might resent. Spend five minutes a day training your brain to be happy for them. You'll die lonely in the jungle if you don't do this and everyone will forget you ever existed.   #2 People in pain.  I've been unhappy often. Particularly in the past decade. Sometimes things just don't work out. Sometimes people die. I think the level of unhappiness and pain I've had in the past decade (versus prior decades) has taught me compassion towards others in a similar boat. Try to cultivate that compassion. It doesn't mean you have to drain yourself to help those less fortunate.     But even showing compassion and doing what you can goes a long way. If you can share what you have, all the better. If you can give a word of advice, do it.  Unhappy person can easily turn into category #4 below. You always have to protect yourself first. Be compassionate but keep your boundaries. Your goal is your own peace of mind throughout the day, so you can focus on your own success. The fastest way to do that is show compassion to those less fortunate. What you give, comes back tenfold. Try this exercise: picture everyone in your life who is unhappy or in pain, spend five minutes picturing them in a happier state. This trains your mind.   #3 Good people.  This is different from Happy. Good people don't always have ulterior motives. Some people legitimately want to help others. There's an initial impulse (at least with me) to suspect them. To resent them. Maybe even to envy them. I envy Bill Gates being able to donate $100 billion to charity. But the best thing for me is to catch myself doing that (almost a meditation in itself) and say, this guy is good. I wish I could be as good as him. I hope I can help him in any way I can. Be grateful for all the people good to you. Five minutes a day. Doesn't have to be with incense burning and in the lotus position. On a bus, smile and think of the people you are grateful for.    (i'm starting to believe Gates has become a genuinely good guy)     And finally, the most important category of all. The category that wastes a quadrillion brain cycles a day around the world. What man can say he is Jesus and not fall prey to the ongoing anger and pain of dealing with this next category:   #4 Crappy people: People who will do you harm,  no matter what you do, for no reason at all. They never will get it. They will say and do things to you and they will never ever understand how evil they are.  And you will hate them. HATE THEM. And they knock on the door of your brain at three in the morning and they want to yell at you. And you yell back. And they yell back. And on and on. All day. All afternoon. The ongoing conversation with the shittiest people in the world. They will torture you, kill you, and slit the thoughts out of your mind and not even care because they think they are doing the right thing.   You know who I'm talking about.  Because you have a good 20 or 30 of these in your life just like I do. They might even be former friends, relatives, neighbors, bureaucrats, whatever, whoever, whenever. They swoop down on your life and are just plain crappy and they won't even know it.  They won't ever know who they are so there is no way to convince them. That's the trap.  Sometimes, in a weak moment, I think to myself: What if I run into them again? How badly I will hurt and destroy them. Maybe just casually walk up to them and smash a glass over their head so their nose is broken, glasses broken on the floor, blood all over their face. Arm broken after I hold the elbow and stomp on it.  STOP!  Similarly, I was talking to someone the other day who couldn't stop talking about someone who had wronged her fourteen years ago. Stop! You are an idiot. And it's boring already.  It was your fault anyway!    This is the worst category. I'll tell you one more anecdote. Two seconds ago someone posted a horrible comment on my blog. I won't repeat it. Racist, mean, rude to me, whatever. I deleted the post, blocked the user, blocked his IP address. And then I was going to send him an email telling him what I thought of him. I was angry. Then I stopped myself.  You have to stop yourself.   Remember this:    When you get in the mud with a pig, you get dirty and the pig gets happy .         There is only  ONE  only way to deal with these people in a way that will make you happier instead of sadder.  ONE WAY . And it always works. This is the most important part of the Emotional leg of the  Daily Practice . COMPLETELY IGNORE THE EVIL PEOPLE:    Completely ignore them.     Don't think about them.    Don't talk to them.    Don't write them.    Most important: Don't give them advice.  They will NEVER listen to your advice. It's arrogant and stupid to think they will. It will only lead to more cycles of pain for you. The goal for me is to stop all cycles that cause me any pain at all. Giving advice to crappy people will only result in more pain for you. That's the only possible result. Much better to be happy than to flush knotted up brown advice down a toilet that caused you agony to push out. This is hard.   Most important: Never gossip about them  behind their backs. Just completely disregard. We don't care about their happiness or how evil they are. We only care about you. Its hard to do. Never ever talk about them behind their backs. Repeat this 500 times. This is hard also. Because it's an addiction.   This isn't easy. It's a daily discipline. Much easier to do a 1000 pushups. I had an article recently on the Wall St Journal site that had 971 comments. No exaggeration when I say 950 of the smartest anonymous trolls on the internet called me an idiot moron and worse. I ignored all the comments. Great. I could care less. I was the winner there.  Then I put another article up on a supposedly peaceful site about Buddhism and yoga, the Elephant Journal. Great site. I post there regularly. The topic of my post was that 18 year olds should basically not be sent into war. I like peace. Better to send 40 year olds. They are closer to death anyway. The most hateful responses popped up. People comparing me to Hitler. I was so shocked I wasted one whole night until 2 in the morning responding to these people but ignoring the many emails I get that genuinely support me and that I want to be friends with.  Why did I do that?  I wanted my haters to like me. I wanted them to agree with me and love me. Its like putting a gun to your head and saying, unless you do what I say, I will kill myself. You're going to end up firing that gun.  I lost my discipline for a whole night and then I slept late and it took at least 36 hours to get back on track. What a waste. For nothing! Its hard to keep up this practice.  But you fail and die unhappy if you don't.    And did I win a trophy for doing this? Was it a huge trophy made of gold? For responding to all of those comments? Did everyone/anyone write back and say, you're right. I'm sorry. Now I LOVE you! Let's all be lovers! Of course not! They just want to fight. I got in the mud with pigs.  I got dirty.    If someone says, what do you think of so-and-so, your worst enemy, you say back,  So-and-so who?  And that's it. No explanation. Nothing more. So and so who? Change subject right then. This is the emotional leg of the Daily Practice and must be balanced with the other three legs. Any deviation will set you back. Any addiction to the opposite of the above behaviors will eat you alive like cockroaches feasting on your heart. Have a good night.     Follow me  on twitter         "
the trillion dollar lies,"         I feel bad. I feel like a sucker. Like one by one I fell for every lie. I talk about don't do this, don't do that, and yet I fell for all of them. I've been in everything from a cult to the cult of homeownership, the cult of college, the cult of sex, the cult of drugs, every cult imaginable, the cult of corporate safety, the cult of money. Why couldn't I just be smart from the beginning? Why does it take stupidity to become smart? Or maybe I'm still stupid. Who knows?  Let's do one of those psychology tests where I ask you something and you say the first word that comes to mind. Here's the usual responses I get after years of doing this:    Me: Home ownership. Other: Roots    Me: College: Other: Good job    Me: Good war. Other: World War II    Me: Success. Other: Fame and money    Me: Iran. Other: They want to kill all the jews.    Me: Voting. Other: Doing something for your country.     Home ownership   think about why you want to own a home. Just really take a step back and forget about all your biases. You think renting is flushing money down the toilet. You might think home ownership is roots' for your family. Why do you think these things? Isn't it suspicious to you that everyone else says the same slogans? That I just wrote down the exact things that are you in your head when you try to justify buying a home?  Does it make sense at all that there is a trillion dollar industry (over 20 trillion to be exact when you add in mortgages plus the part of the economy that is dependent on home building) that wants you to own a home? Banks, the government, home builders, furniture makers, real estate agents, etc are all the priests and ministers of that religion. Don't you think a small part of that 20 trillion goes into hammering again and again the marketing message that you need to own a home?  Just do the basic math on home ownership. It does not work.  It will NEVER work.  Maybe if home prices go down another 80% but that's it.  But this isn't about home ownership. I've bought and sold two homes. And I lost money on both. So maybe I'm just bitter. Who knows.  This is about hypnosis. Why we believe, at the bottom of our hearts, the things that are told to us that have such obvious trillion dollar agendas.   Like college.  Here is what everyone says: You won't get a good job if you don't go to college. I've proved countless times how this is a lie. Yes, you won't get a 90 hour a week job at Goldman Sachs if you don't go to college. And yes, there is no chance in hell you can be a proctologist (although I have known people to start a private practice in this without any degree at all) if you don't have a medical degree. Ok, you win. On those jobs.  But don't you think this trillion dollar industry (where costs have gone up ten times faster than inflation, three times faster than the scam healthcare industry) might have an agenda when they put out these statistical studies.  What else happens in college? Well,  one in four women are raped in college . But because college campuses are one of the few places in the country (Indian reservations maybe being the only other) that provide their own security, you never hear about this. Campus security is not there to protect you. It's there to hide things from you.  So you can get a job at Goldman Sachs, but you're more likely to be raped. Or, I guess, be the raper. You choose.  But don't you learn how to think in college? I don't know, do you? Did you really learn how to think there? Does it really cost $200,000 to think? And what is so great about thinking. Since 1950, when college started becoming almost a pre-requirement for success, incidence of depression has gone up 50 times. How come colleges don't report on this statistic?  Again, ask yourself where you got these slogans. Even my ten year old repeats the slogans. They are marketing slogans created by, again, a trillion dollar industry.   Insurance.  Everyone must be insured. Insurance companies can't deny you because of pre-existing conditions. Everyone says this. Again, why does everyone say the exact same thing. Again, this is a trillion dollar industry. They are telling you what to think.  Let's think about this for a second. Let's say you have a pre-existing condition. Do you really think they are going to charge you the same amount that someone without a pre-existing condition is charged? Of course not. Your prices are going to go up. A lot! And everyone's prices are going to go up.  Do you think the insurance companies are going to lose money?  Of course not. And if you don't sign up, you have to now pay a fine (a tax) to the government. So who wins in this? Do you win? And then the other side tries to go to the other extreme. Death panels. Oh my god! Someone's going to decide who lives or dies?  Of course not. The other side of a lie is not the truth. Its just another lie.   The War against Terrorism . Terrorism is horrible. I lived five blocks from ground zero and watched the first plane go into the towers. Then watched the bodies jump off the top of the building. Now, 11 years later, we're still at war in two countries. Someone the other day was upset at me and said, we pulled out of Iraq. Why did he say that? Because the government told him. We have more soldiers in Iraq now than when the statue of Hussein was toppled. And we are still at war in Afganistan. And everywhere we go we kill civilians and babies. Millions of them. Not to mention our own 18 year olds. And everyone gets upset. We have to protect our way of life. The muslims are going to kill us. Really? Well, then go fight them. Whenever I say that, everyone shuts up. We don't need 18 year olds to fight people. 50 year olds can do it. Everyone gets quiet.  I was for the war in Iraq. I listened to Colin Powell in the UN. He said they had nukes or weapons of mass destruction aimed right at Israel. Oh no! I thought. We have to get them. And I believed him. And now millions are dead. And what was the result? The only country that kept Iran in check was Iraq. And now Iraq is pretty much a colony of Iran. We not only killed millions of people, we destroyed the balance of power in the entire region. Now the only way to restore balance, and its our own fault, is to become friends with Iran.   We need to invade Iran before they invade Israel!  This was said to me the other day. By a guy who quoted statistic after statistic. But who couldn't explain to me how it will happen. There's 70 million people in Iran and Iran is completely surrounded by mountains. How are you going to get in there other than nuking tens of millions of civilians. You can't get in there by ground or boat. Or even aircraft. You have to nuke. And, by the way, most of Iran hates their leadership  as demonstrated by the protests after the last election. Most of the people in Iran are people just like you and me, terrified of being invaded by the US. And Israel has nuclear weapons. Is any country going to really risk Israel, a country that has won every war it's been in, nuking them?      (everybody eager for war should take a geography class first)    I won't be happy unless I'm successful or famous. Look up Ozymandias for the veracity of this one. And yet, it's the American dream. So it must be true. Right?  I get many emails: I need to find my passion. My question is: why? Passion is like a bridge between your current unhappiness and some mysterious future happiness. Guess what  you might be dead then. Passion is also a trillion dollar myth. First, check to see if your breathing. Are you? That's pretty good. You're ahead of most of the other people who have ever lived on this planet.  And finally, we can throw in the massive food industry. Bigger, better, more filling, more nutritious. I have yet to see a food product that doesn't have a lie on its packaging. Look around your supermarket. 80% of a grocery store is filled with processed sugars that are proven again and again to be bad for you but the lobbyists in charge of the food pyramid (the FDA recommended daily value on every box) want you to BELIEVE the religion they propose.  Marketing is not just about clothes or facial products or vacuum cleaners. It's about the very ideas that you dress up in to lead your daily existence. It's the lies that trillions of dollars are spent fabricating that are repeated to you over and over again like mantras until they appear to be baked into your soul. Every lie is one step further from you being calm and happy.   You wake up every morning with a clean slate.  But within seconds your mind dresses you up in all the lies for the day. Must aim for promotion at the job, must kiss ass to customers, must send my kids to school, must stay with my wife forever, must write a blog post, must go to war to defend American values, must vote, must eat organic (the irony being that if everyone ate organic the world would starve), must must must MUST.  The real you is always there. Before the thoughts enter it. Before the lies obscure it. Before you are convinced you are either one of us or one of them.  The real you is neither. Test every thought you have. Your thoughts are not you. They are your children. But we forget that children often need to be disciplined. Else they will test your boundaries and slowly take over the sense of what the real you is. You will forget the real Self that has always been there. Don't let that happen.  Most people live in the dark. Do you think the sun ever sees the dark? The sun is outside. But the dark is by itself, with the shades closed, the door locked, afraid to take a peek, afraid to look into an infinite sky.       "
10 things you need to know to become a great leader,"           They fired me. They fired me as CEO. Then they fired me as a board member. Then they took away my shares. And now none of them ever talk to me.  I started the company, I had the initial idea, I raised $30 million for it from A+ investors (i.e. rich people),  I bought two companies for it, I hired the first 50 employees, and then I was shown the door.  The reason? I was a bad leader. Here are some things I didn't know about my own company: I didn't know what our product did. I didn't know any of the clients. I didn't know how much money we made. I didn't know how much we lost. And I had crushes on the secretaries and maybe two or ten other employees.  I would've gladly stuck my tongue in the ears of any of those employees. Eewww!  But why was I fired?  I just didn't do anything for anyone.  I never wanted to talk. I would lock myself in my office and people would knock and I would pretend not to be there.  If anyone wanted to talk to me about vision I would just nod my head and say something like, make it happen, like I was Captain Picard on the Starship Enterprise.  Being a leader doesn't mean you are the guy who runs things.  Being a leader doesn't mean you created something or you did something great in the past or some other person has given you any kind of authority.  Being a leader happens RIGHT NOW, today, and can be done without money, without authority, and without anybody. First, you have to lead yourself.  It's a mindset. I'm going to make a list. Forgive me. Feel free to add to the list or add your own experiences in the comments. In fact, I would really appreciate if you can add to this list.  After running 20 or so companies (most of them failures). After investing in 30 companies (most of them successes) after advising or being on the board of a dozen companies (most of them successes) and after being married twice (50% success rate), I have a sense of what I think a leader is.  I may be wrong but this is my list.   A) MORE SUCCESS FOR OTHERS THAN FOR YOU   Most important by far: you care about the success of others more than you care about your own success. Everyone around you needs to ultimately become better than you.  That's how you lead. The light is in front of you and you take them to the light and then go back.  If all the people around you achieve more than you, then life will be good. You don't have to believe me. I've seen this happen repeatedly.  It doesn't matter if they are employees, investors, friends, spouses. If you just focus on this one principle in all of your actions then you are a leader. Today: figure out how the people around you can have a successful day.  Hint: don't stick your tongue in their ear.   B) YES, AND   I just wrote a book called The Power of No. Buy it because your life will be better (and I am not ashamed of plugging it).  But now I'm about to tell you to say yes.  Claudia had an idea for a joke this morning that she wants to start a talk off with. I had a suggestion to change it. I didn't say, Don't do that. Do this. I said, Yes, and a technique used in improv comedy.  What does it mean? I trust Claudia and value her thoughts so I if I just say no! it shows I haven't given enough respect into the time she put into coming up with an idea.  So I say Yes, and  and say what is good about her idea and then how I think it can be made even better and why. I give all of her ideas and thoughts respect and add to them rather than ever subtract from them.  CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM WORKS LIKE THIS:  a. Yes, and b. List what's good c. How you would improve d. Figure out the vision that is the base of the idea that you are talking about. e. Connect the Why of what you are suggesting to the initial vision. Does it work better than the initial idea? f. Be open to the fact that you might be wrong. ALWAYS ALWAYS you might be wrong.   C) GRATITUDE   I was talking to Lewis Howes yesterday. He's an athlete turned multi-million dollar webinar and Linkedin expert after living on his sister's couch. He was on my podcast a few months ago.  I don't have a voicemail set up on my phone. But Lewis told me his voicemail says, before you leave me a message, tell me one thing you are grateful for.  He says the messages people leave blow him away.  I always imagine a good leader is surrounded by people who call their mothers at the end of the day and tell them, Mom, you can't believe what I did today. Let me tell you about it.  Not that every day is fun. Because some work isn't. But make sure every day your employees can call Lewis Howes and they have at least one new thing they can be grateful for.  Maybe they learned a new skill. Maybe they met a new client and created value for that client. Maybe a client they hated was fired because you can't let your employees get the disease that bad clients are all too happy to spread.   D) THE 30-150 RULE (ORTHE VISION RULE)   Below 30 people, an organization is a tribe. 70,000 years ago, if a tribe got bigger than 30 people there's evidence it would split into two tribes.  A tribe is like a family. With a family you learn personally who to trust and who not to trust. You learn to care for their individual problems. You know everything about the people in your tribe.  At 30 people, a leader spends time with each person in the tribe and knows how to listen to their issues.  From 30-150 people you might not know everyone. But you know OF everyone. You know you can trust Jill because Jack tells you you can trust Jill and you trust Jack.  After 150 people you can't keep track of everyone. It's impossible. But this is where humans split off from every other species.  We united with each other by telling stories. We told stories of nationalism, religion, sports, money, products, better, great, BEST!  If two people believe in the same story they might be thousands of miles apart and total strangers but they still have a sense they can trust each other.  A LEADER TELLS A VISIONARY STORY. We are delivering the best service because. We are helping people in unique ways because. We have the best designs because. We treat people better because.  A good story, like any story ever told, starts with a problem, goes through the painful process of solving the problem, and has a solution that is better than anything ever seen before.  First you listened to people, then you took care of people, but now you unite people under a vision they believe in and trust and bond with.  Companies live and die on this. One company I advise got built up by buying 200 regional offices, now they are unifying them under one brand.  The key to their success is how powerful the story will be that they tell of that brand. Why are they delivering the greatest value? People need to believe in the story.  By the way, this is how humans killed everyone else. Because now we could plan and coordinate in much larger groups than any other species. That's why there are no other sapiens left on the world. Only homo sapien sapiens (i.e. humans).  Proof: within 3000 years of humans first landing in Australia, no species was left that could put up a fight with us. We killed them all.  Yay humans!   E) CHANGE   Everyone has pain they don't want to feel. For instance, I might feel pain if someone makes fun of my looks. I used to feel pain if someone questioned my net worth, which I equated with self worth. If I'm CEO I might have pain if the numbers go down.  So we do things to hide the pain. We might wear nice clothes not because we like the clothes but because they are buffers for the pain: nobody will make fun of my looks.  Imagine all the things we do as buffers for pain. We might avoid going to the store because we don't want to run into the people who cause us pain. We might hide some numbers because we don't want investors to think we are bad CEOs.  Soon, everything in our lives we might think give us pleasure (because we are now avoiding all the pain) are actually just buffers against pain and change.  When you can get rid of the buffers against pain and change life becomes more insecure, but we become FREE.  We live in a bigger world, a world where risk and beauty go hand in hand and we are no longer afraid of the underlying pains.  A leader is always prepared for change. And realizes that pain is just opportunities to live in a bigger and more abundant world.  This is the secret that most people forget when they build their brick houses and hide inside from the outside world so pain doesn't seek them out.   F) DIGNITY   The other day someone cancelled on my podcast at the last minute. I had rescheduled other meetings and even changed the time I would see one of my daughter's plays so I could interview this person, a very very successful entrepreneur.  She wanted to now reschedule but I said no, even to the detriment of my podcast and all the people who work with me on the podcast who were looking forward to the interview.  I wasn't angry with the person. She's running a business and was probably very busy. And people reschedule all the time. I just didn't like that it was last minute. I had studio time booked and no space to fill it.  I have a vision for my podcast. Everyone who comes on are people who have transformed their lives and created the lives they wanted to. I want my listeners to be helped by the transformative stories of my guests.  The world is changing very fast and it's scary. I want to help people be less scared and I know I am less scared when I hear the stories of my guests and learn from them.  Although I'm relatively new at podcasting (7 months), I treat my podcast as if it's already achieved the dream I have for it. The place where people come on to help others deal with the crazy changes happening in our world and economy.  If I don't treat my own projects with respect then how can I expect others to?  If I don't treat myself with dignity, then how can I expect the people around me to treat me, or even each other, with dignity?   G) THERE'S ALWAYS A GOOD REASON AND A REAL REASON   People come to you every day with problems. The problems are usually very good problems. The client is asking for too much. Or Jill didn't do her job right or My car broke down.  One time an employee asked to meet me outside the office. She was crying. I asked her what was wrong. She was afraid she was doing a bad job with a client.  And she was. But it turned out the real problem was she heard one of my business partners talking poorly about her behind her back and this was affecting her every day at work.  This was the real problem that had to be fixed. And it did. And then everything, employee, client, partner, etc went well.  In 100% of cases there is a good reason and a real reason.  A leader listens to the good reason and comes up with a solution. But then listens even more closely to try and figure out what the real reason is. There is ALWAYS a real reason. Listen for that and see if you can help.  A good solution solves one problem. A real solution solves 100 problems.   H) HEALTH   A sick leader is not a great leader. A leader who is spending time with people not good for them is not a good leader. A leader who doesn't constantly practice creativity is not a good leader. A leader who is not grateful for the abundance already in his or her life will never lead his vision into abundance. He won't know how.  There's no such thing as instant health. There's only such thing as practice and progress. All you have to do is check the box on progress. Progress compounds every day into enormous Abundance.   I) LOVE   Warren Buffett says he skips to work and that he would do the work he does for free. Maybe it's easy for him to say that because he has 50 billion dollars.  But I've gone through and read his letters from the 1950s when he was first starting out. These letters are not publicly available. I had to really try hard to find them when I wrote the book on them in 2004.  But when he was broke and starting his business in his livingroom you can read from his letters that he loved what he did. He took glee in finding companies that nobody else knew about so nobody was looking when they became horribly undervalued and he would then buy those companies.  Don't do something just for the money. Money is a side effect of persistence. You persist in things you are interested in. Explore your interests. Then persist. Then enjoy all the side effects.   J) LEAD YOURSELF   You don't need to be leading anyone.  Before I can lead anyone I have to lead myself. I have to read. I have to try and improve 1% a week. I have a handful of interests and I have a lot of experience.  I have to get better at the things I'm interested in. I have to understand more deeply the painful experiences I've had, I have to every day practice the health: physical emotional mental spiritual, that I suggest to everyone else.  Sometimes I don't. And I feel it. But that's ok. Don't regret. Today is a new day. Today is the only day.  The definition of success for me is: Is today successful?  Because who knows if tomorrow will even exist. Today is the only day I need to think about success.  And every successful tomorrow is determined by one thing: having a successful today.    P.S. The publisher of my latest book, THE POWER OF NO has discounted the price to $1.99. Here it is:http://amzn.to/1sUnwig                   "
step by step guide to make 10 million and then totally blow it,"      $70 million was a lot of money for me at the time. And I couldn't sleep at night until I gave back every dollar to the people who gave it to me.    I was running the sort of fund where people gave me money and then I invested it in other funds. The only problem was, I couldn't figure out what funds were total scams and what funds were legit. In retrospect, I think about 9 or 10 of the 12 funds I was invested in were total scams.    For instance, and this is all in the SEC filings, one fund manager stole $10 million from his fund that I was invested in. He then paid a $50,000 fine when he was caught. Now he's nowhere. I mean, he's somewhere but I can't find him. We're Facebook friends but the last update was him sitting on a beach and it was updated about five years ago.    My investors were furious. They had been making money every month with me. They didn't want their money back. When I told them I was going to give them their money back, with profits, they were so upset many of them didn't want me to take a fee.    In every business I had ever started, even ones that had totally failed, I had kept good relations with the investors. Except for this one. Not a single relationship survived even though I had made money for everyone.    When you can't figure out how you are making money. It's time to change.    In 1998 when kids in high school were learning how to make websites, I sold my website design business for $15 million. Two years later almost all website design businesses were out of business.    And now in 2006, when no matter how hard I tried to figure it out it seemed like the world economy had gone crazy and I didn't understand how these funds were making money. I pulled out all the money.    But I needed something to do or I would quickly go broke. I don't want to act here like I was totally altruistic. I was so miserable all the time. I felt like I had failed and I was also having problems in my marriage. The sort of problems where you'd get in an argument and get kicked out of a car in the middle of nowhere.    I decided to do the only thing I knew how to do and the only thing that has ever made me money ever.    I took one thing I loved and married it to another thing I loved. And, thus, created a new thing. I loved Internet businesses, having built and sold one. And I loved the financial business, despite the fact that it was almost all a scam.     I shut down my fund.    Then, each step that follows was critical to success. If I missed one of these steps I would've failed. Each step was a small step. If you focus on big steps, you'll slip on the small steps.    1) I spec-ed out a website I wanted to make: a financial site that had no news on it but was focused on building community by exchanging ideas. I wanted to give people a way to make good decisions on their own.    When I say spec, I wrote down what all the buttons on the front page would do and what other content would appear on the front page. I completely defined the next five layers of the site and what buttons and actions and content would occur on each page.    2) Once I had the spec, I went to a firm in India and asked them to design five pages of the website. Just the design. No code. This cost me $500.    3) I showed a potential distribution partner (thestreet.com) those pages and worked out a deal where they would help me get traffic AND they would place ads in exchange for 50% ownership. They had a billion pageviews a year so I said, YES!! (Actually, not quite true. I said, I was thinking 3% ownership for them and Tom said, No, 50% and then I said, YES!!)    4) I paid the Indian firm to finish the site. This cost $2000. Then I came up with more ideas for the site and more ideas and more ideas and although we did a soft launch at version 1.0, we did a hard launch at version 5.0 about five months later.    5) I got my friends to use the site. First I created over 700 fake users and manually entered in probably over 10,000 pieces of data onto the site just to make it useful right away. Don't be afraid to do things manually to get things going on your site. Even with user-generated content it's ok if you are the first 1000 users if you expect a million users to benefit from it.    Every successful business, even Google, Facebook, Twitter, started with a combination of manual improvements and friends of the founders using the site.     I got my friends to write reviews of the site on their popular blogs. I wrote articles that would link back to the useful content on the site. I guest blogged on many different websites. This is how you get users back to your site.    Everyone asks me, how do I get users to my site. The above is the answer. It's the only answer.    Don't forget: when you start a website, it's not yet a trusted site. So you have to bring people from a trusted site to your site to build up the trust in your site.    This is true for any site: financial sites, bird-watching sites, weight loss sites, sports sites, whatever.     I created three areas of community on the site: a way for people to message and have friends. A user-generated forum system, and a Q&amp;A system. The Q&amp;A system in particular generated 40% of the traffic the day after it launched.     I had ads on every page at this point. A million users a month. And no employees. So we were profitable. We were making about $100,000 a month with zero employees in just four months. Being too afraid to build this into a big business, I sold the site almost instantly.    I could've used other examples. I could've used the debit card business I started. The delivery service I started. The mental health hospital I was involved in. The billion revenues business I'm on the board of directors of and the many other businesses I've advised and consulted with and invested in.    But the lessons are all the same.     LESSONS LEARNED       GET DOWN ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES AND SCRUB. Even when something is scalable, don't be afraid to get down on your hands and knees and be the first part of that scaling. Don't expect anonymous users to do all your initial hard work. Don't expect computers to do all your initial hard work.    YOU do all your initial hard work.      FREE CONTENT ON THE FRONT PAGE: I had so much free content available it obscured the design. Everyone cares too much about design. Value is 10x more important than design.      OUTSOURCE IN INCREMENTAL STAGES. First we designed pages, then after we knew we were going to get big distribution, we made the rest of the site. Then, based on user feedback and more ideas, we designed four more versions before an official launch. The site changed drastically from version 1.0 to version 5.0.      DIVERSIFY YOUR DISTRIBUTION. Although there was one primary source of distribution (thestreet.com) where I was getting traffic from, I also worked out deals to get traffic from AOL. Yahoo, Forbes, Reuters, and basic advertising.      HERE'S HOW TO NOT WORRY ABOUT COMPETITION. I had competition but they were doing the build it and they will come technique. 95% of businesses forget that it's important to be the first heavy users of your product.    A restaurant is a great example of this. The initial success of a pizza restaurant doesn't depend just on how good the pizza is, but how many of your friends and their friends come in the door to buy it. Don't be afraid to call everyone in your rolodex to come on over and try the pizza.    Actually, this is not quite true either. When I first realized I had competition, I cried. I actually called the developers in India and told them it was all over. They had to cheer me up. One thing I learned ultimately, was that the biggest asset the business had was the passion my partner and I had for it. That passion was much higher than the passion of our competitors so we ended up creating and implementing the best ideas. End of competition.      I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE. I cold-called Yahoo, AOL, and Forbes to get on their radar.    In fact, I had a negative network. The first guy I called at Yahoo said he knew me. Oh yeah? I said because I had no idea who he was.    He said, yeah, I invested in your wireless Internet business and lost my investment.    You would think that would have hurt my chances. Yahoo became one of my biggest sources of distribution after that call. That guy became my biggest advocate within Yahoo.    The key is to anticipate what they might want, show them how it will cost them nothing but they will get huge benefit from it, and then just simply do it. Make it as easy as possible for the other side to say yes before you ask them.    If you want someone to say yes, show them exactly what yes looks like and show them that it is already made.      COMBINE INTERESTS: I had been 20 years already in the technology business (since I was in college). And I had been in the financial industry for about seven years then. So I combined interests and made the best financial website. Nobody else was as well-placed in this intersection as I was.      MAKE THE BUSINESS YOU WOULD USE: I wanted a site with no news, but tons of interesting ideas, perspectives, ideas, and community.    Investing based on news is the fastest way to poverty but it is very common in the hedge fund business for professional investors to call each other and exchange ideas. Hedge fund managers are on the phone all day with each other.    I made it very simple for everyone, and not just hedge fund managers, to do that online.      ABD: Always be dealmaking. Even though I had a 50% distribution partner right from the beginning I was constantly meeting with companies and people to see what extra deals I could make.    I would come up with ideas about the value I could deliver them and then I would offer up that value. Maybe they needed a white label version of my site. Maybe they needed content from my site. Maybe they needed their blog to be distributed on my site, maybe they wanted their newsletter sold on my site.    I did any deal I could do. Until finally I sold the site. But that wasn't even the final deal. I stuck with it and the site continued to grow.      NOTHING IS A STRAIGHT LINE. There were constant cases where the code was bad on the site and the site would crash if it had too many users at the same time. Every other week I thought I was going to have a heart attack because the site kept crashing.    And some companies were very slow to do deals with me. Some companies outright rejected me (Google). You can't be bitter or burn bridges. There may come another day, another company, or all the people at Google might move to other places where you do business with. The key here is to always stay in touch and provide monthly updates showing how you are improving things. Always be willing to help people no matter what.      HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN TO GIVE UP?     Every step of the way I was willing to give up if I didn't see some form of traction. Sometimes that meant more users. Sometimes that meant more profits. Sometimes that meant more technology that I really liked and ideas implemented that people wrote great reviews about.      BUILD COMMUNITY BY HAND. I traveled around the country holding meetups with the most active users so I could see with my own eyes how the site was helping people. It was exciting to me. As long as I had that excitement, I knew something was working.    The people who showed up at those meetups became almost like ambassadors for the site. They were so active they used the site more than me. Nothing beats face to face meeting to build your ambassadors.    Why did I go myself to most of these meetups?    There's a saying in Argentina, When the CEO is looking, the cow grows fatter. A business builds fastest when the CEO is looking at it. There's a thousand details that the CEO sees. There's 100 details that the COO sees. There's 10 details that the regular employee sees. And details slip through the cracks when there is nobody.    At the same time I had also started a dating site (or four) and none of them got traction even though the sites were beautiful and I had smoked my own crack and thought the businesses were great. But no users equals no traction.    Perseverance is like a fire that needs oxygen.    Love is the oxygen for perseverance. You can love it. Users can love it. Partners can love it. Investors can love it. There are a lot of sources of love. Businesses and humans need love to live.    Ultimately, you create value for people and that's how you build the love.    Business is just the delivery mechanism of that love.     Then love + perseverance = abundance.     I sold that business for $10 million and then two years later I was dead broke because once again I forgot all about love. I squandered the love. I forgot my small successes and made them into a big failure.    So I had to start from scratch again. Which I did.      "
