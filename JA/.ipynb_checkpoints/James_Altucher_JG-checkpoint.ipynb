       "{'body': {0: '[Be honest with me. You\\'re 12 years old. Don\\'t you feel that way?On any given day, I\\'m somewhere in between 12 and 17 years old. Claudia, I\\'m sure, will gladly tell you that I\\'m mostly 12. It doesn\\'t matter that I live inside a 47 year old body. I sort of feel 47 year old \"men\" wear suits. And they drink whiskey. And they read GQ. And maybe they check out the interior of a new car. Or they know how to turn on the motor of a boat. Or sometimes they can fix things (non-jews). I do admit, I like to wear a tuxedo. But only if it\\'s five in the morning and Claudia hasn\\'t woken up yet and I know it\\'s good for at least one laugh. If I get one laugh out of her to start my day then that\\'s like starting the motor of the boat. But here\\'s the real reason I know I\\'m somewhere between 12 and 17. When I read a book that I LOVE I like to think I can call up the author and ask him all my questions about the book. Most of the time people don\\'t want to talk to me. Ugh! So I started a podcast in order to have an excuse. In order to sound like I\\'m 47. Now I can say, \"well I spoke with X, Y, and Z. Can you talk to me also?\" Maybe that helps a little. When I worked at HBO in the 90s it was easy. I could go up to any person in the street at 3 in the morning and say, \"hi, I work at HBO. Can I ask you some questions?\" It helped that I had a camera crew with me. But podcasting is similar. I get to talk to all of these superheroes and ask them where they got their super powers and how I can get them also. It\\'s changed my life. So I want to give you the most recent books I\\'ve read by the superheroes who have talked to me. I\\'m giving away 5 sets of 30 books for free.Here\\'s the link to potentially get the books. I hope you win. But even if you don\\'t, I hope some of these books look fun for you and you buy them. \\nWhen to Rob a Bank by Freakonomics\\nWhat to Do When Its Your Turn by Seth Godin\\nThe Game by Neil Strauss\\nBold by Peter Diamandis\\nFinding Ultra by Rich Roll\\nReady. Fire. Aim by Mark Ford\\nLive Your Truth by Kamal Ravikant\\nThe End of Power by Moises Naim\\nSecrets of the Millionaire Mind by T. Harv Eker\\nThe Happiness Project by Gretchen Rubin\\nLive It!

I hope I\\'ve absorbed a little bit of their powers. I know you will also as you read their books. When I prepare to do an interview I:\\nRead all the books by the person I\\'m going to interview.\\nWatch every interview they\\'ve given before so I make sure I don\\'t ask the same question that they\\'ve been asked a million times before. \\nI write down every question I want to ask. I then throw away that list and write it again. Then repeat one more time. The questions that remain are probably the ones I\\'m most curious about. \\nThen I throw out that list and just wing it. Because the conversation will go where it will go.\\nI used to get accused of interrupting too much (\"used to\" means yesterday. It hasn\\'t happened at all today yet!) But when someone says something like it was nothing and I get curious, I want to know EXACTLY what they are talking about. I can\\'t handle it if I don\\'t know something. I don\\'t let anyone just give me their marketing message. I need to KNOW the personal details of their lives. I\\'m really grateful for all the people who have said \"yes\" to coming on my podcast. It was much more work to do this than I thought it would be. There\\'s no money in it. It takes sometimes days to prepare for a single guest. I\\'ve interrupted vacations and my own writing in order to interview a hero of mine. But you can only be 12 years old for 90 or so years, give or take. I hope you either win this set of 30 books, or one of your friends wins a set, or you even get some of the books that look interesting to you. Then, if we run into each other on the street, we can talk about who our heroes are and how they changed our lives. Maybe when we grow up we\\'ll be heroes also.(Here\\'s the link again for you to potentially get the books.)]',\n",
       "  1: '[One of them is dead. The other disappeared and is probably dead. One, I think, committed suicide but I\\'m afraid to ask her brother if that\\'s true.Another went crazy and I had to block him on my Facebook page. And the other I lost track of.They were my best friends growing up.In college I can\\'t remember who any of my friends were. In graduate school I had a \"best friend\" but then I didn\\'t go to his wedding and I felt too ashamed to call him about it and now we don\\'t talk anymore. I don\\'t keep in touch with anyone from my first job. And of all the people in my first business, only one keeps in touch with me. And of the 500 or so people in my second business, one keeps in touch with me. I haven\\'t been very good at bonding. I haven\\'t been very good at friendship. And although I like to think I might have been kind at moments it doesn\\'t seem to have borne any fruits in my current day. Oxytocin is the bonding hormone. It\\'s the neurotransmitter that shoots through your brain when you bond with someone, when you kiss someone, when someone trusts you, causing among other things, happiness. I was always so focused on fake external goals that I never focused on how I could clean my own internal, to make my life better. I lacked oxytocin. Oxytocin also has benefits that can make your life better. It is sometimes considered the \"super hormone\". It is sometimes called \"the love hormone\".\\nWhen oxytocin is flowing through you, it\\'s easier to become intimate with loved ones. People WANT to be intimate with you.\\nIt gives you more confidence and self-esteem.\\nIt reduces inflammation. Which is not only good for healing visible wounds but on a cellular level inflammation is linked to heart disease, cancer, strokes, Alzheimers, Parkinsons, etc. \\nIt reduces obesity.\\nIt\\'s a natural anti-depressant. In other words, the more oxytocin you can regularly trigger, the happier you will be. Oxytocin metabolizes quickly. So the happiness only lasts a short while. Which is why you have to do continual things that help you increase your base level of oxytocin. \\nYou get natural increases in desires to be generous and kind.\\nPeople ask me, \"isn\\'t \\'choosing yourself\\' selfish. Shouldn\\'t you focus on helping others?\"The best way to change the outside world is to do the simple things it takes to make sure you are flourishing in your inside world.The simple tricks it takes to increase your oxytocin will make you generous, kind, healthy, intimate, and more empathetic to those around you. This is one way to make more use of your brain. To gradually transform into a superhero. You can only live inside yourself. You can\\'t live inside somebody else. But if the place where you live is a beacon, then all will feel warmth from the light. Try this: hug someone for six seconds. Oxytocin is triggered. Do you feel the difference? I\\'m an oxytocin addict now. All day long I research new ways to naturally increase it in my body.

       "  2: '[I was cleaning out my closet this morning and what I found made me cry. I found an envelope filled with objects that I had somehow missed when I was throwing stuff out a few months ago. I recognized the handwriting immediately. It was from someone who had been dead for 15 years. I must have been carrying this around with me everywhere. It contained all sorts of notes, articles, and objects my grandfather had collected about me over the years. Whenever I called him he apparently wrote notes in meticulous handwriting about what we spoke about, particularly if I got a good grade on a test or was proud of something. There\\'s also about 40 baseball cards in there that I had collected when I was eight years old (I could see on the backs of the cards when they were from) that he thought might be worth something (Joe Torre, Pete Rose, etc). He also saved my very first resume. It was pathetic. \"Wrote a program to simulate water flows in the Agronomy Department\". What? I can\\'t even remember that job. \"Related Courses\" I have \"Discrete Structures\". Little did I know that I ended up not being very \"discreet\". And now, I\\'m embarrassed to say, under \"Interests\" I put \"Kung Fu\". What the hell?And I had my two addresses. My college address and my \"permanent address\" which is where my parents lived and I guess I still felt that was \"home\". But my grandparents saved it. Maybe I would need the paper version one day to remind me of my many accomplishments at age 21. I showed the envelope to Claudia. She read every note in there. She said, \"they must have loved you\" and I guess they did. Grandparents, no matter how crazy they were in their lives, tend to love grandchildren. I would call them and tell them all my plans (\"wants to be Governor after he is President so he can relax\" says a note from when I was 12 years old) and they would listen. Love is a gift that is given. Accepting the love is the gift you can give back. I wonder if I accepted it enough with them. Nobody at my funeral will bring up \"Discrete Structures\". And certainly nobody will bring up \"Agronomy\" or what my permanent address was. And please, God, I confess to lying about the Kung Fu part. Don\\'t hold it against me! There\\'s the work resume and then there\\'s your eulogy resume, which I hope for me is totally different. I hope people will say:\\nHe was always incredibly lucky, even when times were hard. And he wasn\\'t afraid to say he was lucky. He didn\\'t think it would jinx him.\\nHe had incredibly low expectations, so this way he could always exceed them and be grateful.\\nHe gave us love and we took it\\nHe always said, \"there\\'s always a good reason and a real reason\" because he wanted to help us with the real reasons and not the good reasons.\\nHe told us growth and curiosity is more important than achievements and facts.\\nHe told us to help people.\\nHe made me laugh and now he\\'s making me cry.\\nI hope my kids say, he never judged us. But I\\'m afraid I have to work at that.\\nI hope Claudia says I always put her first, although I think I have to work on that also. (I promise I\\'ll clean out the pantry. Just let me finish!)\\nI hope my friends say, he was always there for me. But I\\'m not sure that\\'s true.\\nI think I have to work on all of these things. A work resume is a snapshot in time with one goal: to get a job. A eulogy resume is the sum of your experiences, not the sum of your jobs or the things you own. It\\'s the collection of the thoughts you\\'ve left everyone with. Make sure you hand out the right thoughts to the right people. But this might be a long time from now. On my resume that I found this morning it says, under \"Objective\", \"to find a creative and challenging position\". I\\'m still on the lookout for that. The meaning of that changes every day.I didn\\'t always listen to my grandparents. So now I want to spend more time listening to my elders. They\\'ve spent a long time figuring the way through this maze. Here\\'s some people over the age of 100 who I am sure will have good eulogy resumes. Maybe one day I can be one of them.(Click here for full image)  The author also wrote about the ultimate guide to changing your life.

       "  3: '[Richard James could care less about World War II and navy battleships. He worked in a navy shipyard fixing things. He was working on figuring out how sensitive instruments can remain stable if battleships were rocking back and forth during rough seas. Then something bad happened. Something that changed his life. He dropped a metal coil he was working on. It walked. He went home to his wife and said, \"I think I can make a coil that can walk down a staircase\". So, during his spare time while saving the world in the middle of a war, he kept playing around with metal coils until he had one that could walk down the staircase. His wife Betty named it a Slinky.Richard and his wife, Betty, set up the \"James Spring and Wire Company\" and figured the orders would start pouring in. They didn\\'t. About a year later, the department store Gimbels gave them some space to display the toy. Nobody looked at them.Frustrated, Richard put a platform diagonally underneath the Slinky so kids could see how it walks. They sold out of all 400.In 1960, Richard disappeared to South America to become a missionary evangelical. He gave Betty control of the business. She never saw him again and he died in the jungles 14 years later.At the time he left, the business was completely failing, was over a million in debt, and she had six children to raise by herself after she and Richard divorced.She sold 300 million Slinkys (two or three billion dollars worth in today\\'s dollars) and eventually sold the company in 1998.People all the time ask: \"what career should I choose?\" or \"What is my passion?\" I feel for them. There is a lot of pressure to simply KNOW what you are going to do for the rest of your life. Even though the economy seems statistically good - money and opportunity feel scarce. Feel depressing. Feel scary. Many people are scared. But these questions (career, passion) are excuses. Nobody thinks about their \"passion\" until they are old enough to be scared they don\\'t have one. Other excuses that could\\'ve been used by Betty or Richard James at different times:\\nI\\'m raising six children with no help.\\nI\\'m millions in debt with a failing business and a cheating husband who left me.\\nOr Richard could\\'ve said, \"I\\'m just an engineer on a naval mechanical yard in the middle of major World War. This toy can wait.\"\\nOr, after a year, \"I better be a lawyer. This toy thing is not going to work out.\"\\nOr, \"I\\'m 35 years old. I should be doing something serious with my life. This is NO TIME to be fooling around with toys.\"\\nWhen they were children did they think that something they created (a simple coil) would sell 300,000,000 units to kids all over the world.I sometimes get overcome with my excuses also. I get scared. I might think: it\\'s too late for me. Or: I\\'m no good. And certainly when I look for it, many people agree with the last statement.And I don\\'t really know what the solution is. But I will tell you what I do. I pretend to be a child. We used to climb on top of rock piles and throw rocks at each other. We\\'d play hide and seek in the woods. We\\'d play ping pong and pinball. We\\'d sit around and read comic books and pretend to be secret agents.We\\'d play catch and then football in the street until our pants and shirts were all cut up and our faces covered in dirt.You remember when you played catch for the first time? When you went on a roller coaster for the first time? Or when you played \"chase\" with your friends?You didn\\'t stop to ask: but what is my \"Career\" going to be? At some point we all started asking that. And then the world seemed scary. I don\\'t know!Richard James could not have guessed what his career would be even when he was already 30 years old. It was a career that didn\\'t even exist. Betty James could not have guessed what her career was going to be. She was raising six children.I feel so bad when I hear kids in high school talk about how they hope in this world they will have \"job security\"... or that they should get a law degree \"just in case\".There is no security. It\\'s a total myth. Income has gone down versus inflation for the past 40 years. Jobs are filled with boredom, politics, frustration, unhappiness. You have to work really hard to make a job work for you instead of the other way around.When I\\'m frustrated I know what I do.\\nI list all the things I loved as a kid. From the age of 5 to the age of 18.\\nI list all the things that are currently related to those things. For instance, if I liked interviewing and rap music, I can interview Coolio on a podcast right now. \\nIf I liked Star Wars, I can interview the author of 10 Star Wars novels. Or maybe write my own book about Star Wars! If I was fascinated by computers, I could learn to program and program an app that I would love to use. If I wanted to be a spy then...maybe I could be a spy! Or at least observe people and then write about what I learn. \\nWrite down all the reasons why you \"can\\'t\". Then burn them. Do it in the sink or something. Set the excuses on fire.\\nThere\\'s a reason this works. When you burn it, your brain is more invested in eliminating the excuses. \"I only burn things that are garbage,\" it thinks from experience and that\\'s how you program the brain. The brain is not where you live. The brain is just a tool. You live somewhere else. Where? I don\\'t know. But maybe we can meet each other there out back. And, I don\\'t know, kiss.I loved playing outside until it was TOO. LATE.My mom\\'s screeching voice rising above the maze of my friend\\'s backyards trying to track me down for a dinner that was going to be cold before a night time that was always dangerous.I wasn\\'t thinking about careers then. And later, when I did think about careers, I was always wrong.I just counted them. I\\'ve had 17 different careers since graduating college. Not jobs. Careers. Working in the hedge fund industry is different than starting an Internet business is different than trying to do a TV show is different than computer programming. And so on.Most of the careers I\\'ve had as an adult didn\\'t exist when I was a kid. Heck, most of the things I do now didn\\'t exist five years ago. And whenever I try to predict six months from now I\\'m always wrong. I never know what I\\'m going to be doing six months from now. Maybe six months from now I\\'ll wake up outside the Matrix and be fighting robots or whatever. Who knows? I think I\\'m qualified.I was so scared of my mom\\'s voice as a kid, calling me home for dinner. I wanted to have fun with my friends. \"James! Where are you!\"She would sometimes drive around the neighborhood, looking for me. I would hide.We all have a compass and for many years I buried it. Where does the compass point? It points to experiences that resemble the experiences you had as a kid. It points to people you like. It points to movement and exercise and creativity and curiosity. It doesn\\'t point to meetings. Or a boss that hates me. Or work that destroys me. It points to the experience that is closest to finger painting with your friends. It points to imagination. It points to funny.Eventually I\\'d have to respond to my mom. Or my friends would just show my mom where I was hiding because adults had power over us. \"Where is he!?\" Life is better when a larger percentage of my day is going in the direction my compass points me. Some days it\\'s 10%. Some days it\\'s 100%. I think I\\'ve been improving my percentage the past few years. I used to play for hours with a Slinky, trying to make it walk down the spiral stairs in my house. Last week.The author also wrote about finding your goal and purpose in life.

       "  4: '[I am the best bad leader in the world. Not only do I know everything about how to fail as a leader but I also have spent large amounts of time with bad leaders.This is a UNIQUE opportunity for you to hear what the top 11 qualities are of bad leaders. All of the time I read articles, \"Top 10 Qualities of GREAT Leaders\".Why do people write these articles? Were they great leaders? I have no idea. In most cases it doesn\\'t seem so. It seems like they write a lot of articles about leaders. Study is one thing, writing is the next thing, but doing and then repeat is how you learn. So why do they write these articles? They write them to get name recognition. They write them to get consulting gigs. To be a life coach maybe to other leaders or CEOS. They write them to get speaking gigs.And that technique works. I know this. If you write enough articles about leadership, someone will pay you to teach them how to be a leader. Try it and you\\'ll see.But I have to stick with what I know. I know a thing or two about good leadership. But good leadership is very rare. I can count a list of good leaders on my two hands. Larry Page is a good leader. Maybe Winston Churchill was a good leader but I don\\'t know.Sometimes, to be a little bit better, you just have to avoid the little bit worse. So let\\'s get started. The qualities of a bad leader.A) NOT UNDERSTANDING THE 30/150 RULEA leader has to follow the 30 / 150 rule or they will be a bad leader.This rule has worked for 200,000 years. If a rule works for 2 years then ignore it. If a rule has worked for 200,000 years then pay attention to it.For 200,000 years humans were tribes. Every tribe had a leader but when the tribe got too big for one leader (more than 30 people), it would split in two. Then, around 70,000 years ago we evolved to handle tribes up to 150 people.Then maybe 10,000 years ago we figured out how to be above 150 people. But this is so new, an evolutionary blip, that we screw it up all the time.But for each of these three categories (&lt; 30 people, &lt; 150 people, &gt; 150 people) bad leaders have different opportunities to prove themselves if they don\\'t understand how the nature of leadership changes based on size of population.B) UNDER 30 PEOPLE: AVOIDING ONE ON ONE GIVINGIf you are a leader of less than 30 people, you have to know intimately the problems of all 30 people (or less) in your organization.You have to know their skills. What they are good at. What they are bad at. What they want to be good at. What their dreams are.Each person should be assigned ONE thing. That\\'s their responsibility. Bad leaders give people many things and then those people do mediocre jobs at all of them instead of being responsible for their one special egg they have to carry from one side of the room to the other on a spoon.When I was running a company with less than 30 people I would take random employees with me to meetings. This way they would see the effect the company had on our clients. My goal: I knew I had limitations as a leader. So I wanted my employees to be leaders.Bad leaders get jealous of the people underneath them and never hire people smarter than them. This is the #1 most common thing a bad leader does. Bad leaders don\\'t want people to rise up higher than them. Good leaders train people to rise up higher than them. Understand each of the 30 people at an intimate level. Know who their parents are. Know what they do for fun. Help them maximize their skills. Make them succeed and shine past you. Bad leaders die lonely as the 30 people leave, one by one. C) ABOVE 30 PEOPLE, BUT BELOW 150: HOW TO SCREW IT UPWhen your organization is between 30 and 150, it\\'s impossible for you to know everyone.So make sure everyone is talking about everyone else. I want to be able to ask A what B is like to work with and I want a real good answer.The people reporting directly to you should be giving more than they are getting to the people working for them. And then thats how the leader, indirectly, gets to know the entire 150 when he or she is putting together teams and assignments and trying to inspire people for a common goal.D) FAILING THE \"VISION THING\"Above 150 people you need to do many things.But here\\'s the #1 thing leaders fail at. No vision.What\\'s a vision? I suppose a 1000 boring books can be written about this. Let\\'s hold off for a second on defining it.But above 150, it\\'s impossible to know everyone in your organization or even know second-hand about everyone in your organization. So the most important thing you can do, in fact the ONLY thing you can do, is lead by example. Show that you all share a common story and vision. For instance, what if 50,000 people are in your organization. Or in the case of the President of the United Stated, 300 million people.You can\\'t unify the people by talking to each one and understanding their problems. You can\\'t define roles and fulfill dreams for people by talking to others who know everyone.You have to unify them with a story. A story everyone believes in and is inspired by and is willing to follow. So if you and I believe in the Yankees, we\\'re more likely to trust each other than if I like the Yankees and you like the Mets.All stories: religions, nationalism, politics, issues, etc are more or less designed to figure out how to unify the greatest number of people with the strongest ties possible.Because we are not so good at it, often this degrades into wars, or poor leadership, or things just disappear into the furnace of time.When Tim Cook became CEO of Apple, everyone was afraid the story would change. The stock dropped.What was the story? It wasn\\'t that Steve Jobs \"gets the most profits\". A story is rarely about money (although money itself is probably the strongest story on the planet).It\\'s that Steve Jobs had the greatest combination of \"technology + design\". Could Tim Cook keep that story going? Tim Cook\\'s leadership will be entirely judged on whether he keeps that story going or if he can successfully change the story.Actually, he has to do both. Because if he tries to turn himself into Steve Jobs then he will be judged on the story of: \"is Tim Cook just a bad version of Steve Jobs.\"So it\\'s a delicate balance. One that has to be dealt with every day in order for him to attract the best employees, keep his customers happy, keep his investors happy, and probably to keep himself happy.This is leadership.E) HAVING A BAD VISIONOk, let\\'s get closer to defining a bad vision. Good visions are difficult to come up with. It\\'s pretty rare.But since I know so many bad leaders I can tell you first an example of bad visions.I\\'ve been in the management of at least two companies worth over a billion dollars. In both cases, leadership was horrible.How did they get to a billion dollars with such bad leadership? Easy. Anyone can do that part. I will tell you how.They went public on the stock market and then used their shares to buy other companies. If you buy a lot of small companies then suddenly you\\'re a messed up big company. Your only vision was: \"we just bought a lot of companies that do the same thing and now we have a billion dollars in revenues!\"Ach! Your vision might even be worse than that. It might be \"We just bought a lot of companies, fired all of the HR people and accounting people (because we had \"synergy\") and now we have a billion in revenues and even greater profits and margins!\"\"Synergy\" means \"bad story\". Every company that has ever done that has failed.Some companies did that and came close to failing. For example, Google never had a chance of failing. But they were buying a company a week when Eric Schmidt was the CEO. They weren\\'t quite bringing these companies in under the fold correctly and Google was starting to flounder. Divisions were being shut down. Morale was at a low because the vision of Google was starting to flounder. Larry Page took over and changed the story. He said, \"Google is the best in the world at these four things\" and he closed down everything that wasn\\'t part of one of those four silos.Everyone left in one of those silos can now say, \"We are the best in the world at this\" and that contributes to the larger vision of Google of having the entirety of world information at your fingertips wherever you are. The first company in world history to do this.Man, I wish I worked at Google, to be honest. It almost happened once when I tried to sell a company to them. I loved their vision so much I wanted to bathe every inch of my body in it. I wanted to be religious about it.And that\\'s what all great religious leaders do. They tell a story. Some elements of a good story:- We fight an evil force (think the Apple 1984 commercial against IBM. Think Buddha rejecting the caste system. Think Washington rejecting a third term because he didn\\'t want the Presidency to turn into a monarchy).- We have something mysterious that nobody else has (a deity, better design philosophy, better technology, etc)- We think people will be happier if they work with us, subscribe to us, join us. Apple often has inferior products to other comparable products. But people are actually happier with an Apple product because the story is so strong.- Our leaders have \"seen the light\" or \"come out from the cold\". Steve Jobs had to leave his company for a decade in order to come back a hero. Buddha had to leave his home for seven years to achieve enlightenment. Mandela was in jail for decades.- Together we are better than apart. The bigger we are, the better we can help people who join us. So..if a company is buying lots of smaller companies, they need a vision that explains why bigger is better.For instance, we\\'re able to help people faster because we understand the needs in every city in the world.- Social proof. A vision should have other stories within it. People your vision has helped. People whose lives became better. People who can stand up and say, \"this changed my life\".Bad corporate leaders will do this: buy all the companies, fire all the waste, report good numbers to the stock market, and then sell their stock, the stock goes down, the company falls apart.I\\'ve seen that happen a lot.F) BAD LEADERS DON\\'T WANT YOU TO CALL YOUR MOTHEREvery day, the people following a good leader should be able to call their parents and say, \"I\\'m so happy. You won\\'t believe what I did/ learned/ met today.\"G) BAD LEADERS TALK BADLY ABOUT THEIR CLIENTS OR EMPLOYEES OR CONSTITUENTSI was giving a talk at one company. It turns out they mostly hated their clients.I was surprised. How can you hate your clients? They are the ones who pay you money. They are the reason you come into work.If you hate what your clients\\' story is, how you can help them achieve their dreams?Leadership is not about achieving your dream. It\\'s about helping everyone else achieve their dreams. This is NOT the employees\\' fault. Everything comes from the leaders. If the leader doesn\\'t love the clients/constituents then the people below the leader and the people below them won\\'t.Trickle-down leadership is the only leadership.H) BAD LEADERS DON\\'T WANT YOU TO PASS THEMI\\'ve had four mentors in my life. What do I mean by that?It means I wanted to be like them. I wanted my life path to mirror their\\'s. I wanted to mimic their behavior and learn their knowledge so I could be as successful as them.I\\'ve had many more teachers than four. But maybe only four mentors.And here\\'s what happened to each one of them: they all wanted me to fail at some point. That\\'s a bad mentor.I learned what I could from them. I did everything they asked. I helped each one of them with their continual successes.But at some point, when I wanted to go on my own and learn more and start my own business or direction, they all were angry and they all tried to stop me and none of them talk to me anymore.In two cases, they actively tried to damage me even though I had never done anything but help them. It even gets worse but I don\\'t want to put anyone down. I was aware of the dangers and went into it willingly.A good leader helps the people around them succeed past them. A great example is Stanford professor, Rajeev Motwani.What!? Who is he?Well, he was Sergey Brin\\'s advisor. And instead of trying to keep Brin in a cage, he opened the cage and Brin flew out and started Google with fellow grad student Larry Page. Motwani became a billionaire as a result.Leadership doesn\\'t ask the question \"How good can I get? How far can I get?\"Leadership asks the question, \"How far can the people around me get?\"People always say negative things about Steve Jobs, because of unfair media portrayals of him. But if Steve Jobs was such a bad person he wouldn\\'t have been as great a leader as he is.People like Tim Cook, Jony Ive, John Lasseter (from Pixar) and many others (even Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney), Tony Fadell (developer of the ipod, who just sold Nest for $3.2 billion to Google) owe huge amounts of their success, their creativity, the distribution of their creativity, and their freedom and well-being, to the fact that at one point or other they were mentored by Steve Jobs or benefited from leadership decisions made by Steve Jobs.All of these people were very self-motivated, which is how they found themselves with someone like Steve Jobs as a mentor.But combine that self-motivation with the leadership skills of Steve Jobs and you end up with great success.The same thing happened at Google with the leadership skills of Larry Page.The CEOs or COOs of Twitter, Facebook, AOL, and Yahoo all were at one point mentees of Larry Page and are now successful leaders and mentors themselves.I) BAD LEADERS DON\\'T KNOW THEIR NUMBERSI\\'m raising my hand. When I ran companies it took me a long time to realize what numbers I needed to know.For instance, when you run a company you need to know not only your revenues and earnings but also your revenues and earnings per employee, per customer, per square foot, etc.This applies whether you are the leader of a company, of a meetup group, of a country, of anything.What are the metrics you need to know to determine success?For instance, if you are the teacher of a class, come up with a list of things you hope your students achieve by the end of the class.Not all of them will achieve it. That\\'s ok.List each student. Next to each student\\'s name, list all of the things you want them to achieve. At the beginning of the class, list each item for each student on a scale of 1-10.Add up all the numbers for all students so you have one final number. This is the number you are starting with.By the time the class is over, that number should be higher. It might mean just one student succeeded greatly. That\\'s ok. Then you were a good leader.If you are having a hard time coming up with the right metrics, just use these: competence, relationships, autonomy. Help each person get better at those three things.By the way, it\\'s important to have metrics. I visited a company recently that I felt had a bad vision for their customers. But even a bad vision is better than no vision. J) BAD LEADERS DON\\'T GET RID OF BAD PEOPLEI was involved with a company once that had a weak leader. He owed his leadership to the largest shareholder of the company.The problem is: the largest shareholder of the company was hideously corrupt. The good leader should have disassociated himself from the large shareholder, built a vision around his own leadership.Instead, he became mired in the financial difficulties of the largest shareholder, was unable to unify the divisions underneath him and provide effective mentorship to the people who directly worked for him.The company fell apart a year after he took over as CEO. Bad leadership, no matter what the situation, can cause almost instantaneous collapse. The 2008 failures of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers are great examples.When Bear Stearns stock price was falling from $80 to $2 within the space of a week, the CEO was off playing in a bridge tournament. Bridge is a card game.While he was playing cards, thousands of employees lost their jobs. And the downfall of Bear Stearns triggered the dominos that ultimately led to the multi trilion dollar bailouts of all banks and insurance firms that happened over the next ten months after the fall of Bear Stearns.Ultimately, the person who had installed him to be leader of Bear Stearns should\\'ve removed him or recognized his own character defects.Here\\'s the problem with that and I\\'ll mention it in the next point.K) A BAD LEADER OFTEN HAS ENORMOUS CHARISMAHow can someone who is a bad leader reach a leadership position?Easy. They have charisma. They are insanely smart and know how to charm the leaders who came before them.A great example might be the set of a movie production. The director is the leader. But he has a big problem. Actors are hired because of their enormous (ENORMOUS) charisma. The world loves them. So when they want something, it\\'s hard to say \"no\" to them. A good director has to fight the urge to succumb to the charisma of the people he is leading and stay focused on the vision.For instance, in the case of Bear Stearns, the intoxication happened the instant the original leader, Alan Greenberg, met the new guy.Jim Cayne, the new guy, was a professional bridge player. In fact, that\\'s all he was. To play bridge well (to play any professional-level game well) you need years of study, you need to be able to read people very well, you need to know numbers very well and to calculate many situations in your head quickly.Alan Greenberg loved bridge also. But he wasn\\'t that good at it. So Jim Cayne used bridge to charm him. Many good leaders are successful game players include Bill Gates (bridge), Warren Buffett (bridge), Peter Thiel (chess), and numerous others. Jim Cayne was able to use this to his advantage. Alan Greenberg was an aspiring bridge player. When he met Jim Cayne he asked Jim, \"How good are you?\" and Jim said, \"if you played me for 100 years you will never be able to beat me.\" That began the road to success for Cayne and then the entire collapse of the American economy.L) BAD LEADERS SMOKE CRACKI don\\'t mean literally. Although if they smoked real crack they probably will never get to a real leadership position.There\\'s a cognitive bias that causes people to not see their own failings. They\\'ve spent so much time, effort, and money creating their particular vision that they have \"investment bias\" that prevents their brains from saying, \"maybe i\\'ve made a mistake\".A bad leader will not admit his faults or even think about them. It\\'s too painful to think about those faults because of this cognitive bias. One time I was starting a company at the same as a friend of mine. I knew instantly his company was bad but, perhaps I was not a good enough friend, I didn\\'t tell him his idea was bad.Instead I would question him: who are the users? Who are the customers? How will you make money?I wanted him to see for himself through my questions that his idea was bad.But because I was asking these questions it sort of \"woke me up\". Every day I would ask myself the same questions about my own company. Every day I would call my partners and ask them, \"am I smoking crack\" and I would go over the questions with them.This process forced me to outline new features every day that could help me provide better services to my customers.I sold my business eight months to the day after I started it for $10,000,000.My friend\\'s business: nine years later he\\'s still pushing it. It has zero revenues.You have to step outside yourself and do due diligence on your own organization as if you were an outsider. Come up in advance, all of the metrics of success. Decide if those are the correct metrics.You have to assume you are smoking crack because often you will be. You can\\'t help it. We\\'re all human. So get help from others in your organization. Get help from customers. Get help from people outside the organization.They won\\'t always be right either. And sometimes they will lie to you just to avoid being hurtful to your dreams (just like I was with my friend).The only person who can ultimately prevent you from smoking crack is you. This separates the good leaders from the bad leaders in many cases.M) BAD LEADERS WERE BAD EMPLOYEESLeadership starts long before you reach the top of an organization or community. At any point in your career, you are either a thermostat or a thermometer (hat tip to Jim Kwik who told me that metaphor). You either define the temperature of the people around you and help them to achieve their goals and dreams, or you simply do as you\\'re told and be a follower and never inspire. How do you become the thermostat? - Every day, 1% improvement on yourself in the areas of physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. This 1% compounds very very quickly. - Every day, do something to help the people around you achieve greater competence, better relationships, and more freedom in their choices. - Repeat this: help others, then give them full credit. Whether it\\'s your boss or your colleagues or your friends or family or whoever. Bad employees and leaders do the opposite of the above. But leadership starts at the bottom, does these three things, and floats to the top.Leadership is a vague term. Because sometimes the boss is not the leader. Sometimes the king is ruled by his court. Sometimes the artist is supported and driven by the leaders in her entourage. And there are so many pitfalls along the way. It\\'s easy to get caught up in ego, money, bad visions, the enticements that flirt with you the higher in the ladder you go. The feeling of, \"Ok, I\\'ve done it!\" when there\\'s still a long path to travel on. It\\'s so easy to give up.That\\'s why I never trust the articles that say \"here\\'s how to be a good leader\". Because I know that I have succumbed to all of the above pitfalls over the past 20 years. If I try to just avoid them (or do them LESS), then maybe one day I can be a decent leader. A leader of what? Well, first, my self.The author also wrote about the 10 Things You Need To Know To Become A Great Leader.

       "  5: '[\"We were assigned this weird project,\" Mollie said. I was trying to fall asleep on the couch but my 13 year old kept staring at me until I said, \"what\\'s up?\" and then she said that. \"What\\'s it on?\"\"We have to write an essay that starts with the words \\'The Power of...\\' \"Of course I thought she was going to write about \\'The Power of No\\' and I would tell her, \"aww, you didn\\'t have to do that just because I wrote the book and I\\'m your father.\"\"So what did you write on?\"\"Well, everyone was writing stuff like the \\'Power of Kindness\\' and things that seemed kind of boring. So I wrote about the \\'Power of Art\\'.\"\"I like that. How come?\"\"Well, with art, you have to deal with perfection. Nobody is perfect. For everyone who loves singing, there is always someone who sings better. For everyone who draws, there is always someone who draws better. You can\\'t make art if you are trying to be perfect.\"She was using her hands to express herself and was getting excited. There was a lot of noise outside because it was Memorial Day and the cannons from West Point were firing. But I was listening closely.\"And sometimes things are hard to say. And art gives you like a different language to say and explain things.\"I liked this.\"So,\" I said, \"Art is both on the outside: with pictures and singing and dancing and so on, but also on the inside, as another way to say what\\'s inside of you.\"\"Yeah,\" she said,\"but if you do it because you want people to like you then you\\'re always going to have disappointment. You can only create art if you love the art itself. And it\\'s not just art but maybe everything.\"So I think I learned something from my 13 year old today. Originally I was just going to plagiarize her and write this but decided to give her full credit. \"You know why we wrote \\'The Power of No\\'?\" I asked her. \"No.\"\"Because I have a hard time saying no to people. We usually write about what\\'s hard for us. It\\'s like our brain\\'s secret way of teaching us. And I think you wrote that essay because there\\'s a little bit of a perfectionist in you and you\\'re trying to figure it out.\" She smiled. After that I took her for sushi and then dropped her off at her friends house where she went swimming. Sometimes a lot of the job of being a dad is to be a chauffeur. But sometimes there are moments.

       "  6: '[I was sick of it. Another day in suck city, daytrading. It wasn\\'t so long ago. But now it was forever ago. I always was fooled into thinking I was smart enough to daytrade.But I hated it. And that day I had lost a lot of money.Where had it gone? Why was I doing the only job in the world where you can lose money instead of get money?Claudia said to me, \"what\\'s wrong?\" But I couldn\\'t look up. I felt it in my stomach, in my chest, in my head, I couldn\\'t move.The sunlight was scattering through the branches outside, falling like stains on the table while she sat there and I didn\\'t know what to say.\"Let\\'s go,\" I said.\"Where?\" We had just moved into town. 65 miles away from the city so I could be closer to my kids.\"Follow me,\" I said.And we left the house and walked about a mile and came to a small island. We walked over the bridge.\"Where are we going?\" she said and I walked us through the paths until we came to the other side of the island, the part facing the Hudson River.There was a small beach there. I had been there before but Claudia hadn\\'t. She thought I was crazy.For some reason everyone on the beach was Hispanic. There in the middle of the day. Why?Everyone was speaking Spanish. I didn\\'t understand anything.\"What are you doing?\" Claudia said and I walked into the water and started swimming.There was a boat anchored about 50 feet away. I could swim to it but I didn\\'t. Instead I swum out far enough where I could sink and put my head under the water.She came in the water also, but just to the point where she could wade and feel the coolness on the lower part of her body and the heat on her face. The day was split in half like that. Just like the sun was about to set.I went under, with my clothes mostly on and I floated for a bit. I couldn\\'t take it anymore.I had just moved. I had just gotten married. I was still losing money. I didn\\'t know what I was doing anymore.And I was just bleeding money and Claudia would realize what a fake I was and my and I would lose her also and then my kids would starve. Everyone would starve.\"Honey?\" Claudia said. And I came out of the water.I pulled her in and she laughed and we floated for awhile and held each other. Other people from the beach, on a 5pm, came in and out of the water.The people on the boat watched all of us. Where was the boat going? Why were they out here on a Wednesday at 5pm?Were they rich, without a care in the world, and maybe they were just going up and down the Hudson River, never worried about anything in their lives.Were there people like that - people with no worries? What separated them from me?We were laughing. I hadn\\'t been swimming in years. I had never gone into the water from a beach.I always thought it was disgusting. What would I step on? Jellyfish were the first beings to crawl from the sea to the land, eventually evolving into sexual creatures, eventually evolving into mammals, into men and women.Would I step on a jellyfish. Would it stick to me? Or seaweed? Or mud, pulling me back in, back to where the jellyfish first came from?When I was above the water I thought that love was everything. When I was floating under the water I closed my eyes and felt like wisdom was that feeling of \"nothing\" you only get when you float. Everything and the nothing.We walked home. Wet. The sun hot but cooling as the shadow of the mountain began to scrub out the sun for the day.I then wrote a blog post. About going broke. About being afraid of leaving my kids. About a crushing disappointment.About something I did that was very wrong. I had been writing for years but I was telling the truth - what a miserable failure I could be. And I was sick of pretending not to be.Someone tweeted - \"too much information\". So over the years I gave more information. And then how I started to bounce back. Again and again and again every time I bounced back using one technique.And now I needed to do it again. And this time I would make it stick. Please, I said to myself, make it stick!Or maybe that wasn\\'t the time I went swimming. Maybe it was the time I couldn\\'t sleep and I wrote up all my numbers and subtracted and added and divided until all that was let was an equation of my panic at three in the morning.And I kept writing numbers until I fell asleep at the table. And then the next day, sickened by myself, I wrote.I don\\'t know which day it was. But I gave up. I didn\\'t want to care anymore. I didn\\'t want to wonder what people thought. I didn\\'t want to care what happened to me.Since then my life has totally changed. I feel like I\\'m in a different universe now. I feel like I\\'m in a different body. That I have a different brain. I\\'m almost ashamed to say I\\'m happy. Or calm. One of them.I never know what will happen now. I never try to know. Today opens up like a mystery book. I give up. I surrender. It hurts to feel that panic. To feel that loneliness. To feel scared that everyone is going to realize what a fraud you are. I was scared.But I wrote. I went underwater and never came back. And this time it stuck.  The author also wrote about his 8 Reasons Not to Daytrade.

       "  7: '[When I was ten I wanted to be an astronaut, a writer, a spy, a superhero, and an advice columnist. I wrote a play. I did spy on people. But I couldn\\'t figure out how to be a superhero. I read collected columns of \"Dear Abby\" (an advice columnist) every day. The only advice I remember her giving was to a woman who was married to a guy who would go to clubs for \"sexual favors\". The woman didn\\'t know what to do. Abby told her! Then when I was in sixth grade I forgot all about the things in fifth grade. I wanted to be President! Then in seventh grade I joined a cult. And so on.

Then it all adds up. If you try to get 1% better each day at your health, at your relationships and the way you treat people, at your creativity, and at turning despair into gratitude, then that 1% compounds into an amazing person. Do that 1%. Take one action. Even if the actions is for one minute. The 1/1/1 strategy. I know this. Because I\\'m still compounding. What is 1%? Whatever you want it to be.

I was afraid I had let them down even before they were two years old. I regret the girl I left because I thought I was going to go broke and she wouldn\\'t like me. I regret thinking I was smart and starting or investing in businesses that I knew nothing about. What do I do now? Smashing a coconut in the street because someone told me it would create good luck. Yes. I regret that. Sometimes I even regret writing or saying things that I didn\\'t realize would hurt some people close to me. I\\'m sorry. But I said it and I believed it and you can\\'t put toothpaste back into the tube. No war can be justified, college is a scam, home ownership is vile, voting is useless, jobs suck, my dad had horrific relationships as a kid that I was afraid I was doomed to repeat - are among a few of the issues that resulted in death threats or lost friends and lost family.

       "  9: '[I think I\\'m in love with Mimi Ikonn. Oh, and also her husband Alex Ikonn. Don\\'t want to confuse anyone!When I was a kid I didn\\'t think I would be happy unless I was a \"millionaire\". Some kids in my school said they were millionaires and they would make fun of anyone who wasn\\'t.I asked my dad what he was worth. He said $2. Maybe that scarred me so much that I always make sure to have wads of $2 bills on me at all times.A year or so later his company went bankrupt. So he wasn\\'t worth the same anymore. In his mind, he was worth ZERO.For the rest of his life he sat in the living room, depressed, and listened to music. When he was a little boy he loved music and won an award.At some point we all return to what we loved as a child. I suppose that means I will return to comics, Judy Blume, and spying on people.A few weeks ago I met Mimi Ikonn and Alex Ikonn. I was insanely curious about them.How come? Because Mimi makes videos of herself, delivers real value to people, and then makes over a million a year because of those videos.I don\\'t know how old Mimi is. She\\'s much younger than me. She\\'s much younger than my father ever was when I was alive. He would\\'ve liked to live her life.So Claudia and I asked Mimi and Alex if we could interview them. Because they seemed very happy also. The podcast comes out later today but here\\'s the summary. This is a simple post. How to make a million.I am absolutely sure the same techniques that worked for Mimi and Alex can work for anyone. I had them lay it out step by step. A) EMOTIONSMimi became obsessed with beauty and hair. She and Alex watched before and after videos of women who were getting hair extensions. \"They seemed much happier after getting extensions,\" Alex said. \"Whenever there are strong emotions about something you know there is an opportunity.\"So Mimi started making videos of herself discussing hair and beauty and hair products.\"I never thought I would get more than 1,000 views,\" Mimi said. \"But I loved doing the videos. And I wanted to share my love for the topics with as many people as possible.\"Now she has had a quarter of a BILLION views on her videos with 2.7 million subscribers.B) HUB AND SPOKEPeople ask: \"How do I get traffic to my blog\". Or \"how do I get buyers of my book.\" or \"How do I get people to follow me on Twitter.\"A lot of it is about loneliness. We sit in our house writing blog posts and then hit Publish. We want family to love them. We want friends to love them. And then we want the world to love them.I\\'m really just talking about myself. I know when people enjoy things I do, I feel as if I have a family. I\\'m happy. At least until the next post.Mimi loved making the videos but needed traffic.So they did the only two-step technique that gets traffic online for anything you want to do. Well, make it a three-step technique.1) LoveKnow more, love more, express more, bleed more, than anyone else. Was Mimi the only one doing videos on beauty and hair? No. But maybe she put more passion into it.2) Spread the LoveAlex would take images and posts and links to her videos and spread them on Pinterest, Instagram, blogs, other sites and have them all point back to her YouTube channel.I call this \"the Hub and Spoke\" approach. Youtube was the hub, with a dozen or so spokes reaching out to popular sites that all would link back to the hub.3) Make more LoveNo matter what you do - some will be good and some will be bad. Not every video or post is going to have views. So you do more.When you do more, several things happen:a. More people find you.b. You rank higher on searchc. You improved. People who find you start clicking on your older videos so now they start to get more views.The \"Make More Love\" technique always works. Michelle Phan did 54 YouTube videos before she made a massive hit. Hugh Howey had already ten novels before he published \"Wool\" which became a massive bestseller. Clayton Christiansen applied for NASA for 18 years in a row before they accepted him.Make more love.C) 1000 PEOPLENote she said she only thought she was going to get 1000 viewers. The number 1000 keeps coming up with people who have HUGE audiences.Kevin Kelly wrote about this in a great post called \"1000 True Fans\". He writes about it kk.org. He also talks about it on my podcast.Tim Ferriss talks about how every one of his posts he makes sure he\\'s going to deliver value to at least 1000 people. Of course he delivers much more value than that. But 1000 seems to be the right number that people who know seem to focus on.Keep focusing on delivering value for a 1000 and then they tell 2 friends and so on and next thing you know you have a quarter of a billion views, five bestsellers, movies being made about you, you go into space, your own makeup lines, and on and on and on, depending on what it is you love.D) BUY LOW, SELL HIGHAlex and Mimi noticed that many of the other beauty videos were talking about a specific brand of hair extensions for women. So they went to my favorite place in the world - the mall.\"We saw these products were priced at $500,\" Alex said. \"So then we went on Ali Baba and saw the same products being sold for $100. We then went to the manufacturers and saw we could buy directly for $50. The exact same products that were being sold for $500.\"They borrowed from mom. Borrowed their full amount off of their credit cards. And they placed an order. Then, I imagine (they did not tell me this) they prayed.E) SOFT SELLMimi talks about many products on her videos. She expressed a radiant, confident personality and talks about everything she is wearing, what her habits are, what products she uses. She NEVER sells anything.But underneath the video is just a link. www.luxyhair.com.The orders came in one at a time. Then 100 at a time. They sold out of their inventory, paid everyone back, and bought more.In their very first year (2010) they had over a million in revenues. Ever since then they\\'ve had more than a million a year in profits. Never once using the words \"buy this\" anywhere.F) QVC-AThe most successful people have a model for their success. I think that\\'s why I enjoy Peter Thiel\\'s \"Zero to One\" book so much. Or Peter Diamandis\\'s \"Bold\". Or Marcus Lemonis\\'s TV show \"The Profit\".Each book has a different, but very very simple, model for how to achieve success or how to judge which companies are successful.Mimi and Alex developed their own model, they stick with it, and have used this simple model to keep jumping from success to success.Alex explained it to me:Q - QualityEverything they do is quality. The cameras they use for videos (\"But not overdoing it, because this is YouTube and not television,\" said Mimi). The setting they use and how it fits their message.The products, etcV - ValueMimi is not trying to sell anything in her videos. She explains what she does and how she does it. She does the research and believes in the products. Rather than asking, she is giving. \"When you give a billion dollars in value,\" Alex said, \"you get a billion dollars or more back.\"C - ConsistencyI read a book about television once by TV mega-executive Grant Tinker. He was Mary Tyler Moore\\'s husband, ran NBC for awhile, and then ran MTM productions producing such shows as \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", \"Bon Newhart\", and a dozen other super hit TV shows.I only remember one thing in the book. He said, \"whenever they changed the time or date of a show, then that show would die. If you moved a show from Tuesday at 8pm to Thursday at 8:30pm then you just lost your whole audience.\"Mimi said, \"if you are going to put out a video once a week, put it out once a week. Put it out the same day each week if you can. Don\\'t do once a month. Don\\'t do random. Your audience starts to anticipate and look forward to your shows and knows when to expect them.\"A- AuthenticityMimi only talks on the videos about what she believes in. There\\'s no fluff. There\\'s no pitch. She\\'s exuberant and it shows on each video.H) LESSMimi and Alex were working 80-100 hour weeks. They had the money in the bank. They had achieved their goals. They loved what they were doing but when you hit a lifelong goal you start to ask, \"is that it?\"They got depressed. Goals are a myth. Our ancestors for 200,000 years didn\\'t have goals. Every day started from scratch: hunt, forage, eat, sex, sleep, wake up to a new day.Then we were told to find our \"goals\". And now everyone asks, \"I\\'m 17 years old and feel like I\\'ve accomplished nothing in life. What should I do?\"Learning to find happiness with less is true wealth. Claudia and I recently got rid of most of our belongings, for instance. Then we started cancelling most meetings that I had set up. Sometimes it was hard. I had agreed to an event and then I would cancel.Ultimately we are the sum of our experiences and not the sum of our belongings. There is nothing wrong with making money but it is only one small part of living a life of comfort, of compassion, of calm.Mimi and Alex started to focus more on the other things that were important in their lives. \"And you know what happened?\" Alex said. \"The more we did that, the more money we made.\"  I really enjoyed talking to them. I am always curious how people made money through a channel like YouTube. Now I know and I think it can be replicated by anyone who is willing to do all of the above.I\\'m afraid I don\\'t have a face for YouTube. Or Instagram. And I\\'m not even sure I have a face for podcasting. But I think I love doing what I do.And I like having the time to explore other interests and ideas.And then sometimes I like doing nothing at all. There\\'s nothing wrong with that also._ _ _Read more from the author James Altucher is an entrepreneur, investor and best-selling author of the book \"Choose Yourself Guide To Wealth\".

       "  10: '[Pierre Levegh killed 88 people in a car race. Even I am not that bad a driver. I\\'ve only almost killed one person. Maybe two.Pierre tried to get ahead of the Aston Martin in front of his Mercedes, made a sharp turn, flew into a wall, exploded, pieces flying everywhere, his skull crushed on impact, a fire and pieces of cars blew into the audience, and 88 people died.The worst accident in a race in history.It was Pierre\\'s sixth race.What\\'s the biggest difference between a professional race car driver who has put in his 10,000 hours of deliberate practice and one who has put in \"just \" 1000 hours?I asked a friend of mine. He said, \"reflexes\".Wrong answer.Both drivers pretty much have the same reflexes.The answer is the rear view mirror. The driver who has put in his 10,000 hours has his rear view mirror adjusted just a few millimeters different from the guy who has \"just\" raced professionally for 1,000 hours.How come? Because the more advanced driver is interested in one thing: PREVENTING A HAZARDOUS MISTAKE. Both have the same reflexes. Both will make the same turns. But the one who checks for more hazards - will win.If you want to shortcut the 10,000 hours, you check for hazards. You check for more things that can go wrong. Then you will get better faster.And you will live. You will stay in the race. Many people think great entrepreneurs take risks. Great entrepreneurs mitigate risks. I\\'m divorced and re-married. If you don\\'t want your relationship to crash and burn and kill 88 people, you watch out for hazards.  I\\'m going to play devil\\'s advocate:Objection #1: Shouldn\\'t we be optimistic? If we\\'re always worried won\\'t that paralyze us? Yes. Yes it will.If you sit around being paranoid then the worst case will happen. Analysis paralysis.When a possible hazard comes up, the amateur will sit and worry. The professional won\\'t think at all. The professional takes action.Only ACTION prevents a hazard.Objection #2: Shouldn\\'t we move towards positive goals instead of constantly thinking of the negative.Won\\'t that attract negativity to us?Let\\'s say you are married. A worst case scenario could be your wife or husband thinks you are not romantic enough and eventually leaves you.Now you will be anxious, sad, jealous. Eventually you might drive your spouse away because you are so jealous.It\\'s not wrong to think you might not be romantic enough. Maybe you are right. But don\\'t sit there and be worried about it.Take action.How do you take action. Spend one minute today being romantic. ONE MINUTE. Maybe tomorrow you can do two minutes.If I\\'m worried I\\'m going to be fired tomorrow then there is a lots of actions I can take.\\nbuild my rolodex\\nhelp my co-workers so I become indispensable\\nmake connections among the customers and the heads of other divisions\\ntry to over deliver on projects for my boss\\nmake your evil plan - take steps forward every day on what you will do if you are fired\\nMaybe take on side projects. Be a consultant. Speak at conferences. Look at the various ways one can make money from home and start to develop those skills. All of these involve taking action instead of \"thinking\" or \"fearing\". A \"boss\" is sometimes called \"your superior\". He won\\'t be superior if every day you take action. Once he fires you, you will be smiling.One time a boss yelled at me, \"I\\'ve seen plenty of your type come and leave and I\\'ve survived you all\".He\\'s still there. And I\\'m here.---To succeed you have to make a contribution to the world. The world is one giant story. Uni-verse. One story. How will the world be better because you were here? It\\'s not easy. That\\'s why they say (mistakenly) you need 10,000 hours of practice to make your contribution. Your stamp. But I\\'m telling you you can skip the 10,000 hours. My worst fear in life is to be \"stuck\". To not know what the next direction to take. To always sit around thinking instead of doing. Here\\'s the secret. The one secret. IDEAS + RISK + PERSISTENCE= CONTRIBUTION. The risk is there because everyone is afraid to step out of line and contribute. But you will be able to do it. Put another way: Ideas + Risk + Persistence = You jump ahead of the 10,000 hours. When your idea muscle is strong, when you are willing to take the risk that nobody has ever taken before, when you persist through all the things that can and will go wrong, you will make your unique contribution. I know this works. Here\\'s how you do it. A) Write 10 ideas a day. You strengthen the idea muscle very quickly. You start having good ideas. I always say my life has changed completely every six months since I started doing this. Now I don\\'t have to say that anymore. Now I\\'m getting emails from tons of other people whose lives are changing.B) Mitigate all risk, shortcut the 10,000 hour rule, by constantly analyzing the worst case scenarios. Then you don\\'t die in a race. Then you don\\'t go broke in an investment. Then your relationships survive and build and you feed off of each other. C) Don\\'t sit in regret or fear. Sitting doesn\\'t do anything. Thinking is just in your head. Take action every day. Even one minute of action. Because one minute every day compounds much faster than money in a bank. After the worst race in car history, the entire racing industry changed. Three things happened:\\nFuel cells were invented. This allowed for higher force impacts without fuel being leaked.\\nBarriers were made stronger\\nHigher barriers were installed so impacts wouldn\\'t effect the crowds.\\nIn other words, ideas happened, risk was mitigated, the world changed. Pierre Levegh and 88 others died but perhaps 100,000s were saved since then. Energy technology (fuel cells) and impact technology were improved throughout the world. And today, while Claudia is hard at work, I will take action. I will bring home a flower. I will look at her ideas. Maybe I can also take a risk. A tiny one. And if I crash into a wall and explode I know I will dust myself off. I will live. I will enter the next race.]',\n",
       "  11: '[We want you to come out here and interview \"Freeway Rick Ross\" on stage.Who?I was talking to Jayson Gaignard. I don\\'t really know anything about anything so Jayson had to explain and then I looked up Rick. And then I got obsessed.Rick Ross had sold about a billion dollars worth of crack cocaine during his \"career\". I read every book. I read his autobiography. I read about a dozen articles. I watched three documentaries.I flew out to Jayson\\'s Mastermind Talks in Napa Valley. Seth Godin has great advice about speaking at conferences: If you speak at a conference either do it for free because you love it, or charge FULL RETAIL. I flew out to Jayson\\'s conference for free. I was really nervous because I knew I had nothing at all in common with Rick. Maybe he would hate me. Some nerdy Jewish guy who thinks he knows everything. I had written down about 100 questions but I knew I wouldn\\'t look at my notes during the interview. I then rewrote them from memory. And then rewrote them again. I knew the questions I rewrote the most were the ones that were probably most interesting to me. There were many things I didn\\'t care much about: politics, legal issues, the Iran-Contra situation (Rick was fooled by the CIA into providing drug profits to the Contras).The rise of gang violence was an issue so before the interview I had lunch with Rick and asked about that. He told me that while he was there, everyone working for one cause: making money, and they knew that if homicide police came in then that would be the end of the money.\"There was less gang violence when I was in charge,\" he said, \"because we were all getting rich\". We had a great interview that lasted an hour and the result will be on my podcast within the next few weeks.Rick Ross\\'s most active years were from 1981-1988. Basically a billion dollars worth of crack went through his organization. His connection was from Nicaragua. His distribution were all the gangs that he grew up with in South Central LA. His family broke up when he was four. He grew up amidst non-stop violence. He watched his uncle kill his aunt. Gang violence was every day. He didn\\'t learn to read or write so when he was 18 he was kicked out of high school and kicked off the tennis team where he was an aspiring champion. That was his one chance, he felt, to get out of the ghetto. He was on the street and needed to make money without an education, a family, and the ability to read or write. He asked an ex high school teacher for advice on how he could make money. The teacher suggested he sell drugs. So he sold drugs. And instead of spending his profits, Rick kept doubling and doubling until all the other dealers were now buying from him and Rick was using his scale to drive his own costs down.Eventually he was the main connection in all of the United States, buying up to $5 million worth of cocaine A DAY.The podcast will have the guts of the interview. But I was impressed how soft-spoken, ready to answer, and humble Rick was. He had spent, in various periods, close to 20 years in jail. Now his main goal was to lecture kids in jail and school how to avoid the situation he was in.Here\\'s what I gather were his main rules on leadership. How to lead a billion dollar organization where many of the people below him (\"all of them\", Rick said and the crowd we were in front of laughed) carried guns.A) TRY TO GET THE PEOPLE WORKING FOR YOU TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN YOU\"I wanted the same for them and for them to even surpass me.\"They might not always take it. But give them the chance to be as successful as you and they will take that example to the people below them. B) HONESTYThis sounds strange coming from a drug kingpin but there aren\\'t any lawyers or courts to track down liars. Honesty is the law in that game.When there are lawyers, people lie and deceive and betray. When everything is based on your word and everyone is carrying guns, honesty is the rule. \"If there was any funny business, I\\'d rather not deal with them anymore, or be very careful with them in the future.\"C) BE VERY LOW KEYNobody ever saw Rick being flashy. He was so low key that even when he was running almost a half billion dollars a year, the police had no idea what he looked like.Part of this was a decentralized structure. People several layers below him in the organization would not have any contact with him and would have to deal with conflicts at their level.\"I had to show by example how to manage, so the people underneath me would know what to do instead of me being always involved.\" D) ONLY DO THE ESSENTIALRick arranged the top level contacts between his sellers and his buyers. Then he stepped back.Everything else had to be dealt with by the people who worked for him and the people who worked for them.\"Everyone knew what they had to do.\" And if they didn\\'t, they stopped being part of the food chain. E) DON\\'T MAKE IT ABOUT THE MONEYAgain: odd advice from a mega drug lord. Rick poured many of his profits back into his neighborhood.This was in part to give back, to contribute. But at the same time, it was strategic.When he went to jail at one point and his bail was set at over a million dollars the million had to come from legitimate enterprises. So Rick could not supply his own bail.Instead, every household on the block he grew up on, put up their own homes as bail in order to get Rick out of jail.When you make it not about the money the benefits never stop since money is only a tiny byproduct of the reasons we live, we do things, we strive for success.F) REDUCE CONFRONTATIONSWhen things have the possibility of getting incredibly violent, reduce confrontation as quickly as possible.Often Rick would simply pay off or write off any losses on people who were no longer fitting in with the organization, rather than have a confrontation with them. Violence could bring in a whole new set of problems. Better to take a loss and move on and now worry about it. G) FREEMIUMIt\\'s almost a cliche, but Rick told how he went to Cincinnati. Stayed with a friend and told him to invite ten of his friends over. Then when everyone was there he gave everyone a free supply and told them if they were interested to come back in a week and buy the next batch. Everyone came back. Sometimes the sooner you charge in a business, the quicker you put a ceiling on your potential for expansion. This is true whether your business is drugs or when Facebook was waiting to charge for ads. H) ASSUME THE WORST\"I always knew I was going to go to jail,\" Rick said. But he wasn\\'t going to sit around and wait for it to happen. He owned over a dozen houses so nobody knew where he was. He barricaded the houses to with multiple iron fences so that it would take the police over an hour to smash their way in and by then everyone would be gone. He would leave town for months at a time. He would put extra profits into \"legitimate\" businesses like a car parts company and hotels. He always assumed the worst, so that\\'s how he was able to diversify all the potential ways he could succeed.  At the end of the interview Rick described how he learned how to read and write in prison. He said that the US jail system spends $45,000 a year per prisoner but refuses to buy prisoners books.He recommended the books, \"As a Man Thinketh\" by James Allen. \"Awaken the Giant Within\" by Tony Robbins, \"Think and Grow Rich\" by Napoleon Hill and \"The Richest Man in Babylon by Og Mandino.He said that when he was broke and his mother was broke and his community was broke and he couldn\\'t read or write and had no education or prospects, this seemed like the only way out.When asked what he could\\'ve have done differently he paraphrased, \"The Richest Man in Babylon\".When I was young I asked the most successful person I knew how I could make some money, he said.He looked down for a few seconds. Looked back up at the audience. Paused. \"I asked the wrong person.\"  Read more from the author...

       "  12: '[My favorite writer on writing died. William Zinsser, author of \"On Writing Well\" died yesterday. He was 92 years old. Was his book any good. I don\\'t know. It sold 1.5 million copies. His students and readers are practically every non-fiction writer I look up to.Stephen Dubner, who wrote Freakonomics, first recommended him to me. I\\'ve always hated books like Strunk &amp; White\\'s Elements of Style but I was looking for a good book on writing nonfiction and Stephen recommended Zinsser\\'s book. Other great books that have been recommended to me by authors: \"On Writing\" by Stephen King, Zen and the Art of Writing by Ray Bradbury, and \"Bird by Bird\" by Anne Lamott although both Tucker Max and Claudia Azula Altucher violently disagree with me on the last one. I happen to love the book and stand by it. What did Zinsser say? Why did everyone love and buy and emulate the principles in his book. You decide. Here is some of his top advice: GET RID OF CLUTTER\"Look for the clutter in your writing and prune it ruthlessly. Be grateful for everything you can throw away. Re-examine each sentence you put on paper. Is every word doing new work? Can any thought be expressed with more economy? Is anything pompous or pretentious or faddish? Are you hanging on to something useless just because you think it\\'s beautiful? Simplify, simplify.\"WRITE FOR YOURSELF, NOT OTHERS\"You are writing primarily to please yourself, and if you go about it with enjoyment you will also entertain the readers who are worth writing for.\"STUDY THE GREATS - BUT ALSO YOUR CONTEMPORARIES\"Writing is learned by imitation. If anyone asked me how I learned to write, I\\'d say I learned by reading the men and women who were doing the kind of writing I wanted to do and trying to figure out how they did it.\"THINK OF WRITING AS A PROCESS, NOT A PRODUCTMany authors \"know what they want to write, but instead of writing they say \\'Well, my main problem is figuring out how to find an agent and get it published. I tell them, \\'The main problem is that you need to write the damn thing.\\'\"READ EVERYTHING YOU WRITE OUT LOUD FOR RHYTHM AND SOUND\"Good writers of prose must be part poet, always listening to what they write.\"HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF AS A WRITER\"I go around giving my students permission to be who they are, and there aren\\'t enough people doing that,\" he said. \"You learn to write by believing in who you are.\"  Every day I try to do every one of those suggestions. Like anything, sometimes it works for me and sometimes it doesn\\'t.  Even though I followed these rules for years I still lost money on almost every book I wrote. You can write beautifully and still never get published...never get paid. But I finally figured out the \"rules\" for profitably self publishing and I write about them here (it\\'s one of the most popular blog posts I\\'ve ever written).]',\n",
       "  13: '[I\\'m ashamed because I felt the need to brag to my 13 year old. But she asked for it. My daughter Mollie had a homework assignment where she had to ask me what I do for a living which put me in a weird position. I do a lot of things. I didn\\'t know how to tell her.But it also shows that school is too focused on: EDUCATION leads to A JOB. This is not true anymore.The reality is:\\nThe average person has 14 different careers in their lives.\\nThe average multi-millionaire has seven different sources of income.\\nSo anything that is \"one job focused\" will create a generation of kids that will learn the hard way that life doesn\\'t work like that. The world changes fast. The jobs I do now didn\\'t exist when I was 13. And the jobs she will do don\\'t exist now. So learning how to learn is more important than memorizing facts. Here are her questions:Hey dad! could you answer some questions about your career for my guidance class? It is a homework assignment.\\nWhat is the name of your occupation? What are the educational requirements to work in your career?\\nWhat do you like in your work? What do you dislike?\\nHow is your day typically spent? What are your work hours?\\nHow did you chose your occupation?\\nWhat advice would you suggest to young people regarding career choices?\\nThank you! Love youHi Mollie! QUESTION #1: What is the name of your occupation? What are the educational requirements to work in your career?ANSWER: I don\\'t have a single occupation. AND you can drop out of school right now and do what I do! In fact, Mollie, I hope you drop out of school right now. Please?I\\'m a firm believer that people feel more well-being in their life when they are around people they love, they are good at what they do, and they have some autonomy (freedom) in how they make decisions. You get more freedom in your life by doing many different things. Some of which make money, some don\\'t, but all increase your COMPETENCE, RELATIONSHIPS and FREEDOM. The three musketeers of well-being. So I am a writer (I write books and articles). I\\'m a podcaster (I\\'ve had 10 million downloads of my podcast). I speak occasionally. And I advise or invest in over 30 different companies. And I screw up a lot. If you do a lot of things, you screw up a lot of things. You have to give yourself permission to totally humiliate yourself repeatedly. If you can do that, then happiness results. With companies I advise I try to stick to one criteria: can this company help over a billion people? [note: I think I exaggerated on that answer. Pathetically bragging to a 13 year old. Maybe a million people is more accurate. Or, heck, a hundred people]. And remember, there are ZERO formal education requirements for what I do. QUESTION #2: What do you like in your work? What do you dislike?ANSWER: I am really happy with the friends I\\'ve made in the past five years. Also, I learn a lot. Probably a day has not gone by where I haven\\'t learned a huge amount. The thing I dislike is that sometimes I don\\'t say \"NO\" enough (even though I wrote the book, \"The Power of No\"). Here is the secret!If something is not a \"hell, YES!\" then you should say \"no\". But even though this is a good technique, it is sometimes hard to follow and you end up saying \"yes\" because you want people to like you and you end up having less times to do the things that make you creative and give you life and energy. I don\\'t know how to solve that. Practice. QUESTION #3: How is your day typically spent? What are your work hours?ANSWER: I have no work hours. Neither will you. You have school hours now but those are fake work hours. BUT. Daily routine is very important. We are at different levels of energy and productivity throughout the day. For instance, at an extreme example, late at night we tend to be tired (that is why we sleep). So if you try to do important work at night, it might not come out good. We are at our peak productivity in our brain from 2 to 4 hours after we are awake. So if we wake up at 5am, then from 7am to 9am your brain is about 100 times more active than it is at night. So I wake up at 5am. I read for two hours. Then I write for two hours because this is the activity that is most important to me. Then I walk or exercise. Then start to do things that require less and less brain power. Like advising businesses (I will do that first) and then do things like running errands or things that don\\'t require as much energy. Our brain is only 2% of our body mass but burns 25% of our calories every day!So how you make use of this magnificent tool that we have is very important for how well your day turns out. QUESTION #4: How did you chose your occupation?ANSWER: I don\\'t have an occupation. But then I got desperate and scared. I started building businesses when I was in my 20s because I needed to make some money. When your sister was born it was like this new US citizen moved into my house and she was one foot tall, didn\\'t speak English, couldn\\'t walk, shat all over the floor, and cried all the time, and I had to take care of her. So I felt I needed to make money to do that. Sometimes I was good at it and sometimes I was incredibly stressed out and bad at it. Sometimes I wanted to run away. But I\\'m glad I didn\\'t. Because now both that little one foot person and you are now in my life. I\\'ve built over 20 businesses and maybe 17 of them have failed and three have done well. But I\\'ve also loved writing and creating since I was a little kid. I\\'ve written every single day for almost the past 25 years. Because I know a lot of people and write about a lot of people I\\'ve also started doing a \"radio show\" (podcast) where I interview people. I\\'ve interviewed entrepreneurs (Mark Cuban, Arianna Huffington), entertainers (Coolio, Amanda Palmer), many authors, many athletes, and all people who have tried to make their lives better. I interview them because I want to learn from them and share their stories with my listeners. I try to be a good interviewer but it\\'s hard. I try to practice. For every ten people that like you, at least one or two people HATE you and they are the ones who reach out and contact you. So the better you do, the more you hear from people who hate you. So you have to give yourself permission to do things that a lot of people hate. And I like helping businesses because often we are solving problems very important to many people.I chose to do these things because I love them and I also love the impact they have on people. It was very hard for me to figure out all the things I want to do and it often changes. When you have impact on people, money is a byproduct. You get better and better at how to make that byproduct when you mine for value. Every six months from now I end up doing different things. I have no idea what I will be doing for a living six months from now. Nobody does. Nothing in life is predictable. You can say, \"I will do X\" but then in a year you will end up doing \"Y\" and that\\'s fine. Being unpredictable is more normal than being predictable. Humans were made to be nomads, to be in different environments, to roam the world, and we evolved to adapt quickly to new experiences. So what new experiences we all adapt to six months from now is unknown. But I hope and think I will still love what I do and still help people and still be creative in everything I do. QUESTION #5: What advice would you suggest to young people regarding career choices?ANSWER: Whenever you are curious, ask questions. If you feel a question is \"stupid\" then DEFINITELY ask that question. If you are shy about asking a question, then ask TWO questions. Claudia has a good trick for this. Whenever she is at a conference and it\\'s question time, she raises her hand fast before she even knows what question she wants to ask. Then she has to figure out a question to ask. Otherwise you stay in a tight line with everyone else. You have to step out of the line to see how the entire formation works. Curiosity will fuel this giant engine we call our brain. It will help you learn things that nobody else knows. It will help you figure out what you want to do and be and what problems you want to solve faster than all the people who are too afraid to ask questions. The next thing is: always be healthy. You can\\'t be creative if you are sick. Every seven years your body is made up of 100% new cells and the old cells die. Where do the cells come from? Mostly from the food you eat. Eat junk and you are junk. Eat well and you are well. Also remember this saying: \"you are the average of the five people you surround yourself with\". If you surround yourself with good, creative, smart people then you will be a good, creative, smart person. These are like your \"emotional cells\". They change 100% every six months. Every day remember to be creative, even a little bit. Write, or read, or draw, or write down ten ideas. This builds your \"creative cells\". Note that my biology skills are off the chain. Finally, remember that every day is the only day we have to work with. Regrets are already dead in the past. And worries about the future are unpredictable.So be grateful for the many blessings you have right now. You have a blessed life with an entire world that is your drawing board. Paint a beautiful picture on it.  Read more from the author... James Altucher is an entrepreneur, investor and best-selling author of the book \"Choose Yourself Guide to Wealth\".

       "  14: '[I remember my dad lighting the water rocket and it flew into the sky and all the kids in the neighborhood thought I was the coolest kid.I remember getting off the train a few years ago when my daughter (now a teenager) was little and I took five photos of her running closer and closer to me: smiling, laughing, ready to be picked up and swung around.Now that little girl has disappeared into the body of a teenager and I will never see her again.I tried to find the photos. To remember that little girl. But I can\\'t find them. Gone.Between those two moments is sandwiched me, squeezed into the blueprint of an adult along the way.Crushed by time and the drudgery of worries, of responsibilities, of eventual death (father), of eventual change (teenage daughter), of aging (me), of the constant struggle (when will they call back, the crushing fear of loss, when will they want me, how can I best choose myself when the world constantly wants to have the first choice). Nobody gives us the map. We have to draw it ourselves. With crayons preferably. Change it every day preferably.But where do we begin? Nobody tells us.Our GPS will constantly reroute and nobody told us that is ok. It\\'s normal GPS behavior.Nobody will tell us that along the way there are many nice places. Stop and enjoy the tea and look around at the beauty, and meet new people.Exchange new ideas, and maybe stop for awhile and learn, but then eventually we have to say goodbye and continue on that journey again. But when?Nobody tells us how important it is to celebrate the moments where we reach a new destination on the map. To cherish the people we meet who are on the same journey.To help the people who are struggling right behind us but have their hands out, ready to be helped. These are our people.Nobody tells us that when we stare out the window and daydream while the adult brainwasher drones on that those moments are the highlights on the map.I don\\'t care about any war. I don\\'t care about whether or not the sun revolves around the Earth or whether the Earth is flat or what religion is right or wrong. Or who is President.I\\'m grateful for two things.When I was a little boy I did two bad things. I would bite my hand all night and had developed a bump all around my fingers created by my teeth. The doctor didn\\'t know how to get me to stop.My grandmother bought me superhero dolls. In the middle of the night she would take my hands out of my mouth and have me hold the dolls. So I stopped biting my fingers.I also wet the bed every night. I would wake up soaked every day.My grandmother would come into the room and wake me up around 2 or 3 in the morning so I could go to the bathroom. Gradually I stopped wetting the bed.It\\'s hard to save the world. It\\'s easy to think of five or ten little things you can do today to help someone\\'s life completely change. Give them something to celebrate. Make their lives a little happier. Even a single laugh is rapture for the body.Five or ten things to help them make their map a little more clear. Their journey a little easier.Everyone wants purpose, or to make the entire world cooler, or to create a virtual reality, or to lead the planet. Everyone wants to find their rocketship to take them into the universe.We didn\\'t know if it would work. My dad said, \"everyone run\" and then the rocket took off and flew all across our backyards and I was happy and proud and only much later would I find things that would crash me down.And much later I would lift my daughter up and swing her around while we both laughed.Both of those moments are gone and I know I didn\\'t appreciate them enough. I miss my five year old. And I miss me being five years old.That\\'s ok. I have today, and the map spread out before me, with coffee stains and creases, and words I can\\'t understand, and places that have no roads, and places I may one day go.(Photo by Timothy Krause)]',\n",
       "  15: '[Imagine if someone asked \"would you invest in this company?\" Your answer is going to be similar. With a few additions.Here\\'s the checklist I would follow:A) Has the CEO built a business before.This is not always reliable (Mark Zuckerberg or Larry Page hadn\\'t built businesses before) but there\\'s an interesting stat:85% of startups fail. If the CEO has built and sold a startup before then the odds go down to 25%. So you might as well have the statistics on your side. B) Does the company have good funding? By good funding I mean two things:a. Enough money to last at least a year. And, by the way, this is an important thing to note: if the company has six months or less worth of funding THEN THEY ARE ALREADY OUT OF BUSINESS. Which is why \"A\" above is so important. Good CEOs know this. b. \"Good funding\" means people (or funds) who will also write second checks. If all they have is one year\\'s worth of friends and family money then you are taking the risk in a year they will run out of money. Why take risks when there are plenty of other good jobs out there. And, I\\'ll throw in a bonus third thing on this: it shows they are the type of company / CEO who can raise money, sell his vision, etc. C) Do you believe in the vision? This can mean several things. a) The CEO is creative enough to develop a strong vision and he\\'s also a good enough communicator to convey that vision. b) You would use the product (if the product was applicable to you)c) You can\\'t use the product but you can easily see how this product can help a million or more people. I\\'ll give a good example and a bad example. Good example: Tesla. You would work for Tesla if you believe in Elon Musk\\'s vision of reduced need on fossil fuels, or if you want to drive a Tesla, or if you think if everyone driving an electronic car (and having a powerwall) will help a million or more people. Bad example: someone pitched me an idea where consumers can pick the type of ads they see. I do NOT see how this would really help a million or more people. So I would not work for a company like that (and, by the way, they had a lot of investors). I invested in a startup recently that developed a technology for vaping vitamins and medical drugs. I USE the product (I vape B12 with it, Vitamin D with it, and trans-reservatrol). And I can easily see how this can help a million or more people (the entire US is Vitamin D deficient and people\\'s bodies are unable to digest vitamin pills. (Btw, not trying to get anyone interested in this - already fully funded). D) ValuationYou\\'re presumably getting options at a startup and, depending on the value you contribute, those options will increase. How do you know if their latest round valuation is good?Forget for a second the money they raised (we dealt with that above). But imagine you had, in cash, the amount of their full valuation. Would you be able to create a better product with more traction? Like, for $46 billion, would you be able to beat Uber? Unclear to me. But there are plenty of startups out there where if you gave me their full valuation in cash I can easily see how they can be replaced. Don\\'t work for a company that is easily replaceable at a lower valuation. #2 consideration. If you believe in the valuation, make sure your options are not at the venture capital price but at the \"409A valuation\" price. Google that. E) LearningThere\\'s a great story about Sergey Brin interviewing people. He can usually tell in the first few minutes if he\\'s not going to hire someone. So then he spends the rest of the interview making sure he learns at least one thing from the interviewee. Make sure that even in the worst case scenario where you misjudged everything else, that you at least learn one thing fairly quickly after you take the job so that it adds to your skillset and you can move on to get a better job. I took a job once at HBO (not a startup but still) where I learned so much in a three year period I was able to take the skills (ranging from technology to entertainment to TV production) that I was able to leave and start a successful company. F) SubtletiesI visit a lot of companies per year for various reasons. I always look for the subtleties. a. how do the partners get a long. For instance, one company I was about to invest in was a co-CEO situation. I heard one of the CEOs gossiping about the other. I didn\\'t invest. The entire culture of a company comes from the top down. So if the partners who started the business don\\'t have their emotional act together, the company itself won\\'t be emotionally sound. b. how do the employees talk about the clients. Read the biography of the founder of JetBlue. He would stay up to 3 in the morning every night responding to customer service emails. Once a month he would ride on one of the longer plane rides and starting at the back of the plane and moving to the front he would sit with every passenger and ask them if they had any problems with the flight. He actually hired employees that way. That\\'s the CEO but everyone in the company should have that attitude towards customers. A year ago I visited a law firm where they were trashing their customers and making jokes about it. That\\'s not the sort of company I would hire, work for, invest in, etc. A company and it\\'s customers are ONE eco-system. Not \"us vs them\". c. your boss and his/her boss. A lot of bosses make hiring decisions based on \"would you ride in a cross-country airplane next to this guy\". You should make your decision the same way about your potential bosses. Believe me - they need you more than you need them. So you have to like them. Also, think ecosystem again - try to see their relationships with other people in the company. All gossiping is bad. Hopefully they think highly of the people they work with. Else you shouldn\\'t work for them and you shouldn\\'t work for that company. G) Demographic TrendsWarren Buffett is not a value investor. Everyone thinks he is but he hasn\\'t done real value investing since the early 1960s. Warren Buffett is a demographic investor. Two quotes from Buffett: \"If a company is going to be here 20 years from now then it is probably a good stock to buy\". and\"If you have a strong demographic wind behind you then the company will do well even with poor management\". Example: the book, \"Bold\" lists a lot of demographic trends that take advantage of Moore\\'s Law that are getting bigger. Robotics, Internet of Things, 3D Printing, etc. That\\'s one start. Another start are companies disrupting healthcare since that is such a mess right now. Another example: I\\'d rather work for Uber than a company that lends money against taxi medallions. I\\'d rather work for AirBnB than Marriott. I\\'d rather work for Tesla than GM. H) Light At the End of the TunnelYou can\\'t ask in your interview, \"when will you IPO?\" It\\'s unpredictable when a company will \"exit\" (i.e. get sold or IPO or have some event which allows employees to sell some of their shares). A good company might wait 7-10 years before an exit. In fact, a good company SHOULD wait 7-10 years. How come? Because if they are good then they are undoubtedly growing faster than the market. So they should stay private as long as possible to maximize benefits for shareholders / employees. Here\\'s the problem. The average employee stays at a startup for 3.1 years (perhaps that corresponds to vesting schedules, I don\\'t know). Make sure you can wait for that 7-10 year run. Also, I\\'d try to figure out if management is ultimately interested in an exit. Some CEOs are not. I) Eventual ProfitsMake sure you see the path to profitability. Some startups might be years away. But the good thing about working for a company that ultimately has huge margins (not just profits but margins) is that they have a lot of perks. Just compare the chef at Google with the chef at Walmart. Hint: there IS NO chef at Walmart.  This seems like a big checklist before you decide to work for a startup. But don\\'t forget that YOU are the valuable person here. Take care of all of your needs and then you will have more freedom, be able to demonstrate greater competence at your job, and have better relationships with the people you work with. In other words, you\\'ll be happy. And that\\'s a nice reason to take a job.  (Photo by Heisenberg Media)]',\n",
       "  16: '[In this series, professionals share what they\\'d do differently  and keep the same. Follow the stories here and write your own (please use#IfIWere22 in your post).First off, you might wonder how I could reach you from the future. I can\\'t tell you that. Stop asking. Second, don\\'t believe anything in this letter. This is not an advice letter. You don\\'t need any advice from me. After 22 you have some very happy moments and some very unhappy moments. Surprise! I can tell you that the key to being a calm, pleasant person is three things:\\ndeveloping competence\\nhaving good relationships with the people around you\\nbeing as \"free\" as possible\\nWhat does free mean? It has nothing to do with money or relationships. Money and Relationships only magnify what is already inside you. What inside you is bad. If you have a good relationship, you will ruin it. If you have money, you will lose it. I can only describe with an example. Remember when you worked for that professor and you were always afraid what he would say to you? Like, if he said, \"good job\" you would feel good about yourself. And if he said, \"bad job,\" then you would feel bad about yourself. BEING FREE MEANS YOU DON\\'T GIVE THAT POWER to any person or any goal or any object or any situation. Being free means that YOU don\\'t even have the power to make yourself feel good or bad. Think of all the things you are unhappy about right now. You don\\'t like the girl you are living with. You failed all your classes. You are horrible at everything you try to do. If you subtract all of them from your thoughts, then what are you left with? You\\'re still you. The same you. But you don\\'t have any of those thoughts any more You don\\'t have to forget. Just don\\'t dwell. New things will happen today. Amazing things. You can\\'t predict tomorrow. That\\'s why I\\'m writing this letter. So no need to dwell on yesterday. You have today! That\\'s big enough. Then you start to figure out who you are. Because the past is gone. Who are you today?Your choice 100 percent. That\\'s freedom. But I know you want to argue with me. There\\'s all the skills I\\'ve learned, you say. Ok. There\\'s all the people I\\'ve met, you say. Ok. I\\'ve put a lot of time into X, Y, and Z, you can say. Ok. I know some things are RIGHT and some things are WRONG. Ok. I\\'m not going to argue with you. You\\'re only 22. You\\'re not even a piece of shit. Listen to me: Don\\'t believe anything I\\'m about to tell you. If you listen to me, then you will never LEARN what I am about to tell you. Listening is like programming a computer. You take stuff in, you process it, you spit life back. Learning is different. It shatters your life. There\\'s bankruptcies, abortions, divorces, crying, bombing, deaths, betrayals. There\\'s fear. There\\'s stark, raging, maddening, filthy fear. Just relax. Those things are going to happen. Enjoy them. You can\\'t avoid them. These are opportunities to learn. That\\'s your only goal.Listening makes you a better person. Learning makes you a new person. You have to rebuild yourself when you learn. Here are some things you will learn. Some myths you have been taught to believe that you will learn were wrong. You will be horrified when you learn them. You will think your life is over. You will reach for the exact amount of pills that will kill you. You will hold them next to your mouth, about to swallow, when your baby starts to cry. Enjoy it. But listen to me: please don\\'t believe anything I tell you in the picture below. See you soon.]',\n",
       "  17: '[\"I hate everyone I work with,\" I told my astrologer / therapist. \"I feel like everything I say is fake just so people can like me.\" I had clients calling me at 4 in the morning asking for advice. Then they would forget to pay their bills. Years later I was calling new clients in a new business and helping them solve their divorce issues. And years after that I was pretending to be best friends with people who then fired me, didn\\'t pay me, and never talked to me again (until they needed me again - and then they offered me a job I refused). I was always stuck because I was pretending to be someone I wasn\\'t in order to get something I ultimately lost. My integrity and my self worth and my net worth were all connected and I didn\\'t know it. That\\'s why I would lose everything. Until: Me. You. Us. Me: I chose myself. Physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. I don\\'t need to write about those anymore. You can read past posts (or maybe my next one. Who knows?)You: Then I needed a second layer. I had to find the right partners - close friends, spouse, business partners. Nobody is creative by themselves. We all fight an unbearable loneliness. It\\'s with others that we form our creative partnerships. Our McCartney for our Lennon. Our Marie Curie for our Pierre Curie.Us: Then the third layer. Silicon Valley is a scene. Thousands of people moved there in the past forty years and created a technology empire.Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and Larry Ellison and all the hundreds of people that brought personal computing to the masses grew up together and made each other stronger, even when they were bitter enemies. New York is a scene. It was an art scene. A literary scene. A financial scene. You don\\'t have to move anywhere anymore. That\\'s the good news. You can be like me and live in an empty house seventy miles from anywhere. You can live nowhere and travel around in AirBnBs. But you MUST build your scene. This is the group that be the heart beat of your ideas. The group that will spread your ideas through it\\'s blood and bring them to life. These are the people you rely on to tell you if you are an idiot. If you are going in the right direction. If you are doing something unique and special.I can call someone in my scene and say \"help\" and they will know exactly what I will mean. They will help me. I will help them. These are the people who will connect all the dots. You grow up with these people. One day you\\'re all hunting and hungry. The next decade you\\'re all climbing the ranks together, bringing your creativity to new levels. The next decade you\\'re helping the generation that comes after you. They spread creativity and energy like an infectious disease until you all catch it. That\\'s how I was able to finally grow and find some success after I chose myself and found the right partners. It works in reverse as well. If you get infected with the negative, then nothing will stop you from coming down. You will get sick as well. Choose Yourself. Find your Partner. Build Your Scene - That\\'s the pyramid every successful person in history has gone through. Here\\'s the basics on building that scene. Do 1% of this a day. These are the people who will feed you, who will make you honest.(Click here to view full image)]',\n",
       "  18: '[I was so ashamed of everything in my life that I moved myself about 100 miles away from everyone I knew. I cut off all ties with people. I stopped talking to everyone.I didn\\'t have a job. My kids didn\\'t know anyone. I had nothing to do. And it was snowing all the time, at least in my memories.But then something happened. A couple of people moved into town and brought a Scrabble set with them every morning to the cafe. We all started to get there at 6 in the morning so we could play Scrabble. Soon there were two games going. We all became friends. Sometimes if two of us were hanging out in the afternoon we\\'d take walks. We\\'d eat lunch. We had more coffee. We talked to each other about our problems. Even in the worst, most embarrassing, horrifying moments, we would share what was going on. I can\\'t believe the things I shared. The things she shared. He shared. They shared. Horrific things. A friend listens. A friend is curious.A friend doesn\\'t judge. A friend offers suggestions but doesn\\'t force their solutions. I\\'m not ashamed to ask for help from a friend. I\\'m pretty much ashamed to ask for help from anyone else. Sometimes I meet a new person and BAM! Magic! We don\\'t need to be friends for 40 years. We can\\'t stop talking. Our chemistry is friends. Sometimes I really like people but I can also sense, \"I can never really be friends with them\". Eventually they drift away. That\\'s ok also.When I see a friend, sometimes I can\\'t wait to talk and update and...but I already know. When I feel that rush in my chest its my body\\'s way of saying, \"there\\'s a friend!\" I miss my friends that I haven\\'t seen in a long time. But I have some friends where we pick right up even if we haven\\'t seen each other in years. And I have other friends I know I will never see again. That\\'s ok. I love the fact that we were once friends. Friends don\\'t expect a lot from me and I don\\'t expect a lot from them. Then... guess what? Our expectations are always exceeded. 100%Friends introduce me to other friends they think I will like. I do the same. I think my friends will like each other. Friends share ideas with me and I share ideas with them. I have idea sex with friends and we grow idea families together. Our little babies. We watch the babies grow. It takes a village to grow ideas.Friends make me laugh and I make them laugh right back. And when one of us cries, the other tries to listen. Sometimes we laugh even though neither of us made sense. We don\\'t dwell on our non-friends. They don\\'t exist.You don\\'t wait once a year for a big friendship party. For me, it\\'s important to have friendship \"celebrations\" as much as possible. Little ones. Maybe every day. A river of friendship instead of a rare lightning storm.Friends help me get better at things. Friends point out when they think I\\'m wrong but know I probably won\\'t listen. Friends help me make decisions that give me more freedom in life. Freedom to have more time to be friends! Too many people wonder \"What\\'s my goal!\" Too many times I\\'ve said, \"I can\\'t be happy without X or Y!\" Too many times there are awards and slights and goals and ideals and dreams. All of those disappear. My memories of friendship never disappear. For the past ten years I\\'ve had more friends each year that the year before. I\\'m celebrating that today. And maybe I will tomorrow also. Sometimes I miss friends I haven\\'t seen in a long time. Don\\'t worry. Even if we never see each other again... we saw each other once.]',\n",
       "  19: '[I used to love my job. Love it. I worked for my favorite entertainment company in the world. I would\\'ve paid to work there. I made friends at work. And on weekends we\\'d even get together and play poker. Sometimes we\\'d even travel on vacations together. My boss would yell at me but I could ignore him. So I forgive you.I loved the work I was doing. What could be better than being paid to interview prostitutes and drug dealers at three in the morning in the sleaziest most dangerous parts of New York City. I was chased once with a knife. I once had a bottle thrown at me. I had guards at transvestite clubs chase me. And I had a lot of fun! All for money. I will tell you what is better than that, because I can\\'t be so arrogant to think that nothing is better than that. Walking on the moon is better than that. And maybe being a clown in a large circus. Or a famous street magician. But not much else. I always write about \"ten reasons to quit your job\". Of course I still believe that. You should quit your job. But maybe not today. Not everything is black and white. For instance, when I daytraded for a living, many years later, there were some days when I would go to work and LOSE money. WHOAH! Sometimes in the morning I was so afraid to lose more money I\\'d go to the Catholic Church across the street and pray to Jesus that Nasdaq futures would go up in the morning. I\\'m Jewish so it never worked. That never happens at a job. At a job you go into work and they send you a check every two weeks. That\\'s real magic. A lot of times people think the alternative of a job is to be an entrepreneur. That\\'s not true either. An entrepreneur is someone who has a job, but it\\'s a job he made up all by himself. He woke up one day and said, \"I\\'m going to make an app to connect all left-handed people on a dating site.\" And then he raised money, hired people, made an app, tried to sell the app. An entrepreneur has a job also. But here\\'s the difference. In a regular job you can probably get by (maybe unhappily but still get by) forever. But an entrepreneur has a job where there\\'s a well known 85% chance rate of failure. Which would you rather take? I don\\'t want people to stay at a job. But here\\'s several good things about having a job. We can\\'t ignore them. Here\\'s several things to think about it. And I finish with the alternative. A) Steady paycheck.It might go down over time and you might get fired suddenly but for awhile, at least, it\\'s steady. B) Sex.A lot of people have sex with people they work with. That\\'s a really great thing until it isn\\'t. C) Chance of promotion.I don\\'t know if promotion is good or bad. But for about a day or two you think, \"they like me! They really really like me!\" D) Fake money.If you rise really high at your job then it\\'s as if the entire company is your fake bank account. They pay for your travel, your computers, many of your dinners. They might even pay for some of your friends. E) Respect!If you become the CEO of your job then people will respect you. It\\'s not easy to be the CEO of a big company. To be CEO of a big company I will tell you what you have to do: a. You have to work in many divisions of the company so you know what they all do. b. You have to build relationships with the other board members of the company so when the time is right, they pick you. c. Go on vacations with the biggest customers so you become indispensable. It\\'s not such a bad thing to go on vacations d. Build connections between the different divisions. Always be the behind the scenes guy between you, the CEO, and the other divisions. You know what happens after that? Behind the scenes becomes in front of the scenes and you are the CEO. e. Make a lot of money for the company. This seems hard. But it just involves signing one or two large customers or large distribution partners or launching a lot of products, one of which might become successful. Try things long enough and you will make a lot of money for your company. f. Always over promise and over-deliver.Sometimes people hate that. They want to underpromise and overdeliver. Don\\'t do that. That\\'s stupid! Most jobs are not so hard to over-promise at because for years, the employees before you have been under-promising. And the jobs are not that hard. What...are you trying to launch a spaceship to the Moon? Overpromise and overdeliver and you will keep getting promoted because nobody else is doing it. F) You Can Afford to Have an Evil Plan. When I had a job I started a company on the side. I was also trying to pitch TV shows on the side. I was doing lots of things on the side. I was a hustler. My bosses didn\\'t mind because I was overpromising and overdelivering. I started a company in 1996. My new company took me eight hours a day at least. But it wasn\\'t until August, 1997 that I left my fulltime job to join my new company. 18 months. Why did it take so long? Because that\\'s how life works. You don\\'t start something and suddenly everything changes. You start something, make sure it\\'s right, test the waters, build up, get rid of all the risks, and then make the jump. Being an entrepreneur is NOT about taking risk, it\\'s about ELIMINATING all risk. Being an entrepreneur, or having multiple sources of income is ultimately safer than having a job. But only if you use the job to get rid of, one by one, all the risks. Just being an entrepreneur, without having multiple sources of income, without first taking care of the risks, is suicide. G) Be an Entre-ployee.Maybe you like the people you work with and you like what you are doing. I wish I were you. At a job you can do something that you can\\'t do elsewhere. You can LINK your financial success (or other kinds of success) to the success of the larger company. If you can figure out how to do this, then you can stay at your job forever and watch it grow. If you can\\'t figure out how to do this then you MUST QUIT. But only when eliminating risks. I was always trying to figure out how to convince HBO to spin off new divisions or companies that maybe I could help run. It never worked out. Nobody listened to me. But I tried. A great example is the world famous Craig Silverstein. Oh wait! You don\\'t know him? He\\'s a low-level programmer at the Khan Academy. But before that he was the first employee ever at Google. And now he\\'s a billionaire. His success was totally tied to the success of Google. Google is a search engine on the world wide web. H) Summers are Off. The first summer I was at a full time job it was really heaven. Most of management basically took off the summer. Deadlines on all of our projects slowed down. My work was right by a park so I\\'d sit in the park all day and play chess. When you\\'re an entrepreneur you don\\'t have summers off. You don\\'t even have three in the morning off. I\\'d wake up at three in the morning and try to calculate out how I was going to make payroll for the next six months. It was really painful. I) You Get to Switch Jobs. The average American employee stays at their job for 3 years. This number is getting smaller and smaller. People move around jobs. Get lots of experiences. Meet lots of people. Make more and more money (hopefully). And then, when they have enough contacts and experiences they can set themselves up in a situations where they have multiple streams of income. Maybe this means they start doing speaking gigs. Based on all of their work experiences and knowledge in an industry. Maybe it means they consult. Maybe it means they learn new skills and now start using those skills to help other people. Because if they have a steady paycheck they can build these side gigs over time and eventually start charging. That\\'s what I did TWICE. That\\'s what I would do today. Don\\'t jump over the cliff. Have ropes and safety gear. It doesn\\'t mean start \"a company\". Then you are just going from one company to another. But they start generating a lot more money from many different sources and if any one source is cut off then its not the end of the world. It\\'s just an opportunity to replace that one source of money with an even bigger source.  I write a lot about reasons to quit your job. I write a lot about how life can be better elsewhere. But life is always better elsewhere. We\\'re nomadic mammals. Also, many jobs are bad. The worst thing about a job is your boss. Then your co-workers. Then your pay. Then your work. Then the fact that one person can say words that turn your life upside down: \"you\\'re fired\". So get yourself in a situation with more of the attributes I describe in the ten reasons above. Then it\\'s up to YOU to decide the right time to quit. It\\'s no longer up to a mysterious \"Them\". The important thing to remember is this: Jobs as our parents knew it are dead. Income has gone down versus inflation for 40 years. People are being demoted and spending less years at a job. View a job as just one source of income among many. Build up your sources of income. Be creative. Write a blog. Do consulting on the side. Get more skills. Do speaking. Be an entre-ployee. Then suddenly you won\\'t have \"just\" a job. You wont\\' be an entrepreneur. You won\\'t have any label attached to your money. Have your evil plan. Do it in secret. Work on it a little bit each day. 1% a day. Stay calm. Don\\'t be impatient or entitled. Then you\\'ll be your own person. Nobody will be your boss. There won\\'t be a ceiling when it\\'s finally time to spread your wings and fly into the sky.(Photo by Richard Elzey)]',\n",
       "  20: '[When I was a kid I used to skip school, hide behind my house until my parents left, and then go off to play chess with John Nash. Not THE John Nash, the Nobel Prize winner who also had schizophrenia. But his son, who was a very strong player. We would go over to his house (where his father and mother also lived) and play all day and then I would go home before my parents got home from work. The son also had schizophrenia and I sort of could tell but we focused our days on playing chess all day. At the time, I didn\\'t know who his father was. This was a family of brilliant people. His son was a strong chess master. The father was a Nobel Prize winner. Maybe that makes them mentally strong. Maybe not. John, the son, disappeared and we lost touch. I last saw him I think in 1988. Since then I\\'ve met a lot of incredibly brilliant people. Because of my podcast and businesses I\\'ve been involved in I\\'ve met some of the smartest people, some of the most successful people, some of the most brilliant people in the world. Maybe they are mentally strong. Maybe not.Often many of us are very good at constructing masks and it is never really known what is deep inside of us. What we keep hidden for fear of death if others were to find out. But I can tell you what is most in common with some of the people I have encountered and maybe then you can tell me if you think these are qualities of mentally strong people. I would like to know. All of these things...anyone can do. Anyone can learn to be mentally strong and change the world as a result. Wealth, health, success, strong relationships, and freedom seem to be byproducts of the traits listed below. Here\\'s my trick: I list, for each item, 1-10 on where I rank and then I add them up. So somewhere between 0 and 100. Then every day I try to improve by 1. A) RELATIONSHIPSThe mentally strong people I know, the ones who have achieved the most in life, have ALL had incredibly strong relationships. Friends, spouses, partners, and so on. I\\'ve interviewed billionaires, well known movie directors, athletes, scientists, artists. All have believed in the saying \"you are the average of the five people you spend your time with\". If you build up strong relationships, it means they are supporting your ideas, adding to them, helping you execute them, and not constantly fighting you or dragging you down. B) HONESTYThis is not religious but math. The brain takes up 2% of the body\\'s mass and burns up 25% of the body\\'s calories each day. One in four calories you eat goes to fuel your brain. When you lie, one side of your brain has to deal with one set of lies. And the other side of the brain has to deal with the other set of lies. So to be at optimal mental strength you now need twice as many calories. This is impossible. So the best way to be mentally strong is to be honest so all of the fuel in your body can be used efficiently at propelling your brain from strength to strength instead of fighting off the attacks on your weaknesses. C) IT\\'S NOT ABOUT ME, IT\\'S ABOUT YOUWhenever a girl broke up with me, it never seemed to be about me. That\\'s ok. That was a line to make me feel better. I guess I should be grateful for the many people who tried to make me feel better by blaming themselves. But true mentally strong people constantly are focused on others. They are solving problems for other people. They don\\'t think, \"How can I make money\" since money is just pieces of paper fueled by a mythological story. They think, \"What are problems in the world that I can solve?\" They think, for instance, healthcare is a mess. And since we all know \"prevention is the cure\", how can I develop a product that helps with prevention and diagnostics. And, if you were a genius like Elizabeth Holmes, you would drop out of Stanford, make a company called Theranos, and do exactly that. That is just one example. Mentally strong people are always solving other people\\'s problems. The problems of the individual get solved as a byproduct of solving the problems of the many. D) READINGI\\'ve interviewed over 150 people now for my podcast. Here is one question nobody ever hesitates on: What are the last books you\\'ve read? Do you know why mentally strong people read? I have my guess. We all have one life to live. But when you read, you get to absorb the curated life of another person in just a few days. So if you read a lot, your one brain can hold onto the critical points of potentially thousands of other incredible people. You can bathe in their lives and come out a stronger you. I asked Freeway Rick Ross, the largest drug dealer ever, what books he read in prison that turned around his life. He couldn\\'t read or write before prison. But then he taught himself. He told me instantly: \"As A Man Thinketh\", \"The Richest Man in Babylon\", and \"Think and Grow Rich\". I asked Tim Ferriss, author of The Four Hour Work Week. He said, \"Radical Acceptance\", \"Essentialism\", and \"The Effective Executive\". All 150 people I have interviewed gave answers instantly. I have no doubt if I ask them again next week they will all have different answers. I have never met a mentally strong person who wasn\\'t a voracious reader. E) HEALTHBecause the brain burns so many calories, you have to have health in other areas of your life. It\\'s hard to be mentally strong, to be creative, to execute, to change the world, if you are sick in bed. This is not being judgmental towards those sick in bed. Sometimes we just get sick. We can\\'t help it. But almost everyone I\\'ve ever dealt with in business or in life who has gone on to greater and great successes all acknowledged the importance of constant healthy transformation of their bodies. This doesn\\'t mean lift 500 pounds. It means sleep eight hours a day. It means eat well (which simply means: less on processed foods, more on vegetables, and exchange your 15 inch plates for 10 inch plates), and move. Movement doesn\\'t mean running a marathon. It might just mean walking a lot.Our paleo ancestors got their exercise from walking and climbing on their daily hunt for food. This kept them healthy enough to be our ancestors so I thank them every day for that by following their model. F) CURIOSITYIf you are talking to someone and they say something interesting but you don\\'t understand, do you interrupt them and ask them what they mean? I often don\\'t. And then what happens? Then, for the rest of my life, I will never understand what they mean. Sometimes I\\'m afraid to ask questions because I don\\'t want to seem stupid or I don\\'t want someone to be annoyed at me or I\\'m feeling shy. The only way to learn new things is to ask questions and be curious. Find the people who inspire your curiosity because those are the ones you will most learn from. Then ask them questions. The more stupid you feel asking a question, the more you HAVE to ask the question. If you feel shy asking one question, then ask TWO questions. Every mentally strong person has this one thing in common: the things they most remember that has changed their lives have been the answers to questions they asked. If they never asked those questions, their lives would not have changed. G) LEARN, SAY, REPEAT We think we learn in school. We take a class and a brilliant professor gives a lecture and we supposedly leave the class smarter. But here is the science. Within 45 minutes of leaving a class, college students have already forgotten 80% of what was said in the class. By the next day, they have forgotten just about 100%. Here\\'s how to remember: First you hear something. If it interests you, write it down as a note (carry a notebook. I carry a waiter\\'s pad because they are cheap). Then use it in a conversation within an hour. Then use it in a conversation the next day and then the next. NOW there is a decent chance you have learned it. Because you build various connections in your brain that have now been programmed with that nugget of information. That\\'s how learning takes place. Mentally strong people learn how to learn. H) THE IDEA MUSCLEPeople say \"ideas are a dime a dozen\". This is simply not true. Ideas are \"a dime for three\". Go ahead and try. Come up with 10 ideas for surprises for your spouse\\'s next anniversary. The first three are easy. But, for me, then it gets harder and by #7 I\\'m counting the list over and over again to see if I reached 10. Ideas are a muscle that need to be exercised. If you get hit by a bike and are stuck in bed for two weeks recovering, then when you leave the bed your leg muscles are so atrophied you need therapy to walk again. The same with the idea muscle. It needs to be exercised every day or it will atrophy. How do you exercise it? Pick a theme, any theme will do, and write down ten ideas a day. Every day. I can tell you that when I was broke and suicidal and scared I started doing this. My life has changed 100% every six months since then. It\\'s been incredible. Like magic. I wrote this and shared this with others. Now I get emails from people every six months telling me how their lives have changed. When I was interviewing the rapper Coolio he told me he wrote lyrics down every day for 17 years before he had his first hit. A year after his first hit he had the best selling song on the entire planet. When he described that song to me he described which elements from which musicians who came before him that he meshed together to create his hit. This is called \"idea sex\". When you are an expert in one category and an expert in another then you are the greatest in the world at the intersection. Exercising the idea muscle, plus learning, plus idea sex, will make you be the best in the world at whatever you aim. What about execution? Execution ideas are just a subset of regular ideas. If you have an idea you want to execute on, then your idea list the next day should be, \"What are the ten next steps I need to take?\" Should you then take them? I don\\'t know. Mentally strong people probably make those lists 100 times a year and only need to execute on one of them to change the world. Give yourself permission to have bad ideas. It\\'s only through diligent mining of the universe inside of you that you find the gems that will light up the world. I) PERMISSIONMentally strong people give themselves permission. Why did the Google guys come up with the 8th search engine and think theirs was special? Why did Elizabeth Holmes think it was ok to drop out of the best school in the country to pursue a business dream? Why did Henry Ford, after failing twice at car companies, think it was a good idea to start a third car company. Why did the Wright Brothers think it was ok to make a plane with spare parts from their bicycle shop when the government was spending tens of millions? They all gave themselves permission to do something that has never been done before. They all gave themselves permission to have many bad ideas. They all gave themselves permission to risk their reputation and the forked tongues of the people who would fight them. They gave themselves permission to slip and fall and get up and dust themselves off and try again. And again. And again. And again. They gave themselves permission to love something so strong that every neuron on their brain would light up and conspire to make their dreams come true. If you don\\'t give yourself permission to create a new world, chances are nobody else will. J) PRESENCEI regret so many things from my past. Maybe that one time I lost all of my money, I could\\'ve used it to help my father live a little bit longer than he did. Maybe I could\\'ve held onto my house. Maybe I could\\'ve been smarter about business. And all of the time I am anxious. Will I give a good speech. Will this business I invest in work out? I hope it does. I don\\'t want to go broke again. But whenever you regret the past, or are anxious about the future, you are time traveling. Time traveling seems exciting but it isn\\'t. You can time travel all your life and then suddenly you are dead without ever having lived in the present moment, the only moment that exists. Whenever mentally strong people find themselves time traveling they take a step back. They said, \"What can I do right now to help otihers\" instead of wasting time regretting the past or worrying about the future. Worry and regret never solves tomorrow\\'s problems and only drains away energy from today. Presence will always solve this moment\\'s problems. Mentally strong people solve problems, love people, are curious, stay healthy, have idea sex, are honest with you, and make the world a better place. I hope each day I can improve a little on each level. And if I run into you on the street, maybe we can wink at each other. We\\'re on the same team.(Photo by PopH)]',\n",
       "  21: '[I knew I was going to get thrown out of school. I had already failed three out of the four classes (we took one class a semester). We would get these tests on a Monday morning and have to turn them in by Tuesday at 5pm. Everyone worked all night, for 30 straight hours. I\\'m not ashamed to say I cheated on all of them. But still I failed them. Everyone was so smart in the program, I knew I had no way to compete. My officemate - his name was CB - was the inventor of the best chess computer in the world at the time. Several years later, after IBM swooped CB and the computer up, the computer (called \"Deep Blue\" then) became the first computer to beat the world champion at chess when it beat Garry Kasparov. I worked on it a little. And IBM even offered me a job to work on it more. But I didn\\'t take the job. I was afraid to break out of my routine. I liked a girl who didn\\'t like me. I liked my friends. I liked my easy life. IBM seemed too \"real world\" to me at the time. BUT here\\'s the secret to how a computer beat the world chess champion for the first time in history: They made the computer as stupid as possible. Other chess computers were \"smart\". They knew how to analyze chess positions very well. Deep Blue didn\\'t do that. Deep Blue did the minimum needed to figure out if a position was good or bad. They stripped almost all of the intelligence out of it. Then it had time to move onto the next position and the next position. Hundreds of millions of positions a second while other computers were wasting time with complicated formulas on each position. Deep Blue did \"ready. fire. aim.\" Entrepreneurs should do that also. And writers. And anyone. By reducing the amount of software and intelligence, the computer became the best in the world. Most intelligence should be subtracted. Most experiences should be said \"no\" to. The times when I thought I was smart are probably the times I was most stupid. That\\'s why when they stripped all of the intelligence out of a chess computer, it suddenly became the best chess computer in the world. It beat the world chess champion. And then, before IBM could take any chances, they unplugged the computer. It went dark.They put it in the same warehouse as the Lost Ark, and Deep Blue never played another game of chess again.  When Gandhi died he owned less than ten items. Even though he came from a rich family. Even though he freed a nation of 300 million people. He owned a pair of glasses, a bowl to eat with, a watch (but not an Apple watch), and sandals. Taking my advice, he didn\\'t even own a home. Every day I get emails from younger and younger people all saying the same thing:\"I\\'m 28 and I\\'m miserable because I don\\'t know what I want my career to be.\" \"I\\'m 25 and...\" and yesterday, \"I\\'m 17...\"So many people so miserable chasing something that will never exist. The word \"career\" was invented to staple people to assembly lines. I\\'ve had very bad luck with careers. Every career was like sand being held in my hand. Every home I owned, I lost.Most relationships I had, I clung, begged, demanded, pleaded until they left. I\\'m sorry I clung to you as tight as possible. I\\'m sorry I demanded and yelled and pressured. But ok, it happened.Sometimes I want to know in advance what to dream about. What to dream for. I NEED to know! But before you can dream, you have to relax. You have to clear your head of everything that went wrong yesterday and could get even worse tomorrow.Turn off the intelligence for awhile. Go to sleep. Then, I\\'m told, you can free 300 million people and be the champion of the world.]',\n",
       "  22: '[I forced Claudia to do something she didn\\'t want to do. She was scared but I still made her do it. She had written a lot of inspirational posts about yoga over the prior year. This was in 2010 or 2011. I forget. I had her print up all of her articles and put them down on the ground. Admire them. Love them. Then I had her gather up the ones she loved the most and make one pile. Then I took a stapler and stapled them all together. \"There!\" I said, \"Now you have a book.\" But its just a collection of blog posts, she said. Here\\'s the thing: a. Very few people have read your blogb. The people who search \"yoga\" on Amazon have never heard of you. c. This is JUST a first draft. Rewrite it so it goes from a collection of blog posts to a real book. Write more chapters. Build seamless connections between the various ideas. Do other \"book\" things. You\\'re going to have at least ten drafts before you have a book done. d. You\\'re only going to charge 99 cents. I\\'d pay you 99 cents for a curation and rewriting of all of your best work. You aren\\'t asking for much. I then took a sexy picture of her, doing a yoga pose on a rock leaning right over the Hudson River. That became the cover. A few weeks later, we uploaded to Amazon. She actually made several changes to the book (with new uploads) after the first upload to Amazon. For almost a year her book was #1 in the Yoga category on Amazon or, if not always #1, always in the top ten. Was it a masterpiece! Was it \"War and Peace\"? Probably not. Was it her first book?Yes! Now she was an author. A bestselling author. Since then she\\'s written two other books, both bestsellers. One a Wall St Journal bestseller. She\\'s working on another book right now. It\\'s easy to come up with excuses:\\nIt\\'s just a collection of blog posts.\\nIt\\'s not perfect.\\nThere are smarter yoga people out there than me,\\nPeople are going to hate me if they see what I have to say.\\nAnd many more excuses. In fact, some people did hate her. Yoga people have a strange way of hating people. One woman wrote her and said, \"you still need to work through \\'samskaras\\' from other lifetimes.\" Ok, so now put that in the list of excuses to writing a book. Then burn that list. Actually set it on fire. Her book became an incredibly valuable resource for people just starting yoga. Over 20,000 people bought it. So ok: what happened? It\\'s a specific technique and you can use this technique for creating anything. COMPONENTSList the ten components you need to do something: a book, a website, a business, a spouse, whatever. What did she need to write a book? The body of the book (50,000 words), a cover, 10 rewrites, and a distribution platform. FIRST DRAFTWith brute force you can create the first draft of anything. Example: let\\'s say you have a design for a jewelry item. Go to shapeways.com and print it up right now using their 3D printer and then set up a store on Etsy and now you can take orders, sell jewelry, and not even carry inventory. You have a \"first draft\" of a jewelry store made up of your own unique designs. EXCUSESI love excuses. If you don\\'t have any excuses then nobody will hate you. If nobody hates you then nobody will like you either (I\\'m sorry, that\\'s mostly the way it works). If you are afraid what parents, friends, family, colleagues think then that\\'s a good start you\\'re about to embark on an exciting journey. Bon voyage! Come up with as many excuses as possible. Then burn them. You have to burn them. There\\'s scientific proof on this. But I forget what it is or who the scientist was. Maybe Einstein or Stephen Hawking. I think the ashes that come out of your burned pile of excuses are called \"Hawking Radiation\". I don\\'t know. I didn\\'t get to the end of that book. The \"Brief History\" one. SPRINKLE IN VALUE You need to move beyond the first draft. Claudia wrote new chapters. Tied together chapters that didn\\'t stand alone in a book. And added more value. Then she rewrote. A lot. Now it\\'s a book!UPLOADYou don\\'t have to upload to Amazon. But that\\' s a good place to do it. A trusted site where people buy books. Maybe nothing would happen afterwards. Nothing magical. No angel would come down and bless you. But you did it! And now you can do it again. And you can love it. And get better. And give permission. And love more. And give more. And create more. CREATE. So many times we are afraid to permit ourselves to be flown away on a dream. Now she had a book done and published. A dream come true. She told me, \"I can\\'t believe I wrote my first book.\"She\\'s working on her fourth book now. She gets better every time. That\\'s what happens. When you do something once, it might not be good. And then you get better. The first time Michael Phelps swam he almost drowned. Then he got a little better. In 1994 I wrote a book of short stories. I had this one idea: It should fit in the palm of the hand and can be read on a bus, since I used a crowded bus to commute to work then. So I stapled together all of my short stories and wrote some new ones. Then I made it so you can read it in just one direction, then turn it upside down and read it in the other direction (i.e. you\\'re always reading the right hand page and ignoring the left hand). I then went to every store in town and asked them to sell the book for 25 cents. I wanted it to be the price of a video game. Maybe I sold 100 copies. I forget. It didn\\'t matter to me if anybody read it. I DID IT.One time I had an idea for a website. A dating website. I outlined it. Outsourced it to India. Launched it. Failed. Started another one. Failed. Started another one. Failed. Ten times. Succeeded. I\\'m not suggesting you do something bad. I\\'m not suggesting you do something scary. I\\'m not suggesting you get a lot of people to hate you. I\\'m suggesting you give yourself permission to love.]',\n",
       "  23: '[Failure is not good.Failure is the worst thing possible. You feel sick. You feel like you\\'re going to die. You feel like if you don\\'t die you might kill yourself.There is absolutely nothing good about failure. And there\\'s nothing you can pretend to learn from failure.Lately, we\\'ve been living in the Golden Age of Failure Porn. Everyone wants to share their story. Everyone wants to \"fail forward\".You can\\'t learn anything from failure because don\\'t forget that every single moment in your past has added up to that one moment in your present - where you are lying on the floor moaning your painful and abysmal failure.Stop whining. And stop using the word \"failure\". Blah!Here are better things to learn from. Failure has many cousins. Learn from one of the cousins:Curiosity: When something happens and you don\\'t understand why, then ask, \"Why?\"Keep asking questions. Clearly, something confusing happened. Ask and ask and ask.Guess what will happen: you will get answers.Experiment: Sometimes people say Thomas Edison failed 999 times before he finally came up with the lightbulb on the 1000th try.This is a total lie. It is normal in a lab to experiment with many many materials before coming up with the right one.Oh! Your experiment didn\\'t work? Ok, change something and let\\'s try a new experiment.Persistence: I get asked: how do I market my book? Or my app? Answer: write another book. Write another app.The best way to get better, to get more known, to learn the subtleties of your art or your field or your sport, is to simply do it again.Persistence + Love = Abundance.Forgiveness: I used to live in regret. One time I sold a business for $15 million. Within two years I had lost almost all of the money.And it wasn\\'t money on paper. It was money in \"real life\". If I tell you how I lost it you would hate me forever. That\\'s ok. But it\\'s not important for this answer.\"Failure\" is a word used to label a past event. That\\'s 100% up to you how you label a past event.When you label a past event \"failure\" it prevents you from moving beyond the past. You get stuck there. You keep time traveling to the moment of failure under the excuse that there is something to learn there.The thing you learn first is forgiveness. Then you move back to the present. Get healthy. Be around people you love. Start being creative again.Study: When you get a question wrong on a test, a good student doesn\\'t call it a failure.It\\'s a pointer to one single question wrong on a test. Study a bit more next time and you won\\'t get that question wrong anymore.Understand and study and remember the correct answer. Don\\'t keep living in the past where you remember the wrong answer.Athletes always go over their losses. They study videos. Go over games. Get advice from coaches. The coach doesn\\'t say, \"here\\'s where you failed!\"He says, \"here\\'s where you should turn right instead of turn left.\"Botvinnik, the World Chess Champion in the 1950s, noticed he often lost chess games to people who smoked.So he would play practice games against people who would smoke in his face.He didn\\'t say \"I fail against smokers\". He became the World Chess Champion because of smokers.\"Failure\" is not a detail you can learn from. Again, it\\'s a label that describes nothing except a feeling inside of you.Details are what you can study and learn from.Hard Problems: The key to success is to solve hard problems. Searching the Internet is hard. Google does it better than anyone.Making an electric car is hard. Tesla does it better than anyone.Figuring out a market for post-it notes was hard. The inventor tried for over 20 years. Now it\\'s 3M\\'s most successful consumer product.Writing a book is hard. Maybe your last book was bad. That\\'s ok. That happens to everyone\\'s first book. Now read a lot of good books so you can solve the hard problem of what makes a good book. Then write.Failure is not a hard problem. It\\'s a label. Failure is in the past. Hard problems can be solved right now.Don\\'t Care: When I thought I had failed, what I really was worried about was: would other people think I was a failure?Yes. Yes they did.When I stopped caring about that, when I took the word out of my vocabulary, I suddenly stopped caring what people thought.Then what happened? Only good things.  My dad failed. He had a company that went bankrupt. He went broke.Then he got depressed. He couldn\\'t stop thinking about the failure.Then he got sick. He was always sick. Because his body broke down from obsessing on the failure.Then he got a stroke. Depression + stress + sick = stroke. Then he never recovered and for two years he never moved and could only blink.Then he died.I\\'ve started a lot of businesses. Some worked. Some didn\\'t. Over a period of many many years. MANY.I hope I\\'ve solved a lot of hard problems. Maybe not the best I could\\'ve but I tried. And then tried again.I\\'ve slipped on the ice rink and got up. I\\'ve cried and wished I were dead but then I started asking questions.Lots of questions. Lots of studying. Lots of learning. I\\'ve never failed. I am still alive.(Photo by Chris Potter)]',\n",
       "  24: '[She said \"No\" to me and slammed the door. She was on my paper route. I asked out every girl on my paper route. All three of them. I liked having a captive audience. I\\'d hand them the paper and say, \"Want to go to a movie?\" They all said \"No\". Well, one girl said, \"Yes\" but then the next day her brother told me she really meant \"No\". I made about $2 an hour on my paper route. It took me about four hours a day and then another five or six hours on the weekends collecting money. One time, delivering papers, a guy drove by and yelled, \"one day you\\'re going to rule the world!\" I guess because delivering papers somehow showed work ethic. I worked hard but hated it. I had no life but delivering papers. So I will tell you another story. Don\\'t tell anyone please. It\\'s our secret. The local video store once gave me pamphlets to put at every house on my route. He gave me a $20 bill. I took it. Within 15 minutes, I threw all the pamphlets in the sewer and never went back to that store. All of this is to say: My daughter is considering taking an $8 an hour job. I said to her, instead of that: why don\\'t you go to Lynda.com or CodeAcademy.com and learn basic Wordpress skills. You can make blogs for stores. It would take you ONE DAY to learn the basics. Then go from door to door to every store in town. Say for $1000, plus $50 / month maintenance, you\\'ll make their blog or basic website for them and help them upkeep it. If they require a \"shopping cart\" then charge them $2500. She frowned a little and said, \"They will say No. They don\\'t need it.\" She doesn\\'t want anyone to say No to her. I can relate to that. I don\\'t like it when people say No to me either. I said, \"Ok, we have about 40 stores on this street. Let\\'s say only 2 say yes. That\\'s $2000. It will take you ten hours to do the work. That\\'s $200 an hour instead of $8 an hour. And then the $100 a month you make in maintenance will take you about two hours a month.Here\\'s another idea, I said. To be on Wikipedia you need about 10 media references. We were in a restaurant. I pointed at the wall. \"How many reviews does this restaurant have.\" She was digging in. \"I don\\'t know.\" She looked away. \"More than ten,\" I said. \"So you can make a Wikipedia page for them. Charge $200. Maintain it for $10 a month.\" Or maybe every store needs a Facebook page. 1 in 7 Americans are on Facebook RIGHT NOW THIS SECOND. Restaurants can use their Page to get local customers to \"Like\" them in exchange for coupons and future messages. Again: $500 for setup and $20 per store per month to maintain. She didn\\'t want to do it. It\\'s not a skills issue. ANYONE can get the skills by studying one or two online courses for about a day or two. She does have skills at drawing logos, editing short videos, and some basic design skills she can improve with a course or two. On fiverr or freelancer.com she can do an infographic for $20-50 and it would take her thirty minutes. Why work for a boss? Here\\'s my guess. She wants to work at a hang out place. So she can work while seeing her friends. Ok, I get that. I would love to work at the same time that I hang out with my friends. But if she started doing what I suggest here\\'s what she would learn: A. SHE WOULD CREATE SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHINGMost jobs don\\'t let you create something out of nothing. You just move some shit over to some other shit and get paid shit. The best things in the world are when you create something out of nothing. Like: I created her (in part) out of nothing. I admit I had help with that. B. BASIC COMPUTER SKILLSSeriously: if you think you don\\'t have computer skills, take three online courses. Now you are in the top 1% of the world in computer skills and can charge for those skills. C. REJECTIONThe most AMAZING skill to learn. I\\'ve put in my 10,000 hours of being rejected. I am a MASTER of rejection. Every time you get rejected you learn a little more about yourself, about how to approach people, about building strength, about getting out your comfort zone. D. SALESShe\\'ll learn to look at a situation and find what the urgent problem is, what a useful solution can be, and how can she uniquely solve it. E. YOUR NEW BEST CUSTOMERS ARE YOUR OLD CUSTOMERSOnce she starts making money she\\'ll do what most people do - she\\'ll want to make more money. There\\'s only two ways people who make money make more money.\\nGet new customers.\\nOffer your old customers new services.\\n\"2\" is the most reliable technique people have used since 3000 BC. Which would force her to learn even newer skills and solve bigger problems for her customers. F. OUTSOURCINGMaybe someone wants a shopping cart integrated with a database of products. That\\'s too much for my little girl to handle. She can outsource that to India for $100 and pocket $900. Not so bad. G. FRIENDSHIPSUltimately, customers become friends. How come? Because in a good business you don\\'t want to do business with people you don\\'t like. People think business is \"Shark Tank\". Real business is more like \"Tuna Tank\". Customers become friends, they become testimonials, they pay your bills, they refer other customers to you. Some customers even want to smoke crack with you but I\\'d advise her against that. Customers are a good, fun thing and some of them end up changing your life (don\\'t smoke crack with them, honey). H. YOU DON\\'T NEED A BOSS TO MAKE MONEYRemember: every time you have a boss - he\\'s taking some of your money. And his boss is taking some of your money. I hope my daughter will do one of these things but I don\\'t think she will. I hope my daughter realizes that the average multimillionaire has seven different sources of income. A job is only one source. Guess what? Being an Entrepreneur is also ONLY ONE SOURCE. I don\\'t recommend being an entrepreneur (i.e. starting a company, hiring employees, having an 85% chance of failure and depression) unless you are a masochist. Some people say to me, \"how can I convince so-and-so to \"choose themselves\" or \"not go to college\" or \"be more creative\" or \"quit their job\" or ...\" .You can\\'t. Nobody can. And I guess that\\'s the whole point. I couldn\\'t convince Beth Mosesman on my paper route to date me. Even though my braces were glistening with passion. My greasy hair was reflecting the sun. My paper route was reeking of luxury. I can\\'t convince my daughter to make money the way I want her to. The best I can be is a good example. Sometimes I\\'ve been a bad example but all I have to work with is \"now\". Right now she\\'s a teenager so doesn\\'t really listen to me. Teenagers have to bond with their peers and reject their parents because 200,000 years ago it was their peers that would save them from lions. Not old people like me. I don\\'t know if I could save my daughter from a lion but I would try.But she still watches what I do. The greatest miracle on this planet is that a small cloud can block the sun. But only for a little while. The sun will come up again tomorrow. It will power the entire planet. Nothing can stop it. What does this have to do with my daughter rejecting my advice? I don\\'t know. Maybe everything.(Photo by Loco Steve)]',\n",
       "  25: '[Although you probably won\\'t care. Why would you care what I have to say?  Hi James, you\\'re 106 years old. Congrats! Boy, I never thought you would get there. You were too stressed. It\\'s not like you\\'re an athlete or anything. I\\'m writing you this letter but you don\\'t even give a shit. You\\'re 106 years old! I wish you could write me a letter back and tell me how you did it. Can you? But what advice would you even want to give me. I know you: you TOTALLY don\\'t care. I don\\'t even know if I want to be 106 years old. Like, if I die tomorrow that\\'s fine with me. Maybe that\\'s a selfish way to think. I don\\'t know. I\\'m going to be arrogant enough to give you advice on what you should be doing at age 106. Because that\\'s the kind of punk you were. MY ADVICE TO 106 YEAR OLD JAMES:- NO GRUDGES. You can\\'t cradle a grudge and love a grudge in the same way as when you were much younger. Historical is hysterical. A grudge is a hysterical historical. Why would you care? - SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF.I hope I have a garden when I\\'m 106. So I can put things in dirt. And make sure I cover up those things correctly. And then water the dirt. And then clean up. And then look at what I did. Love dirt. - ENJOY KIDS. If you\\'re 106, maybe it means you\\'ve stored up a lot of life force. It must be great to share that with kids. So then they get older with that life force. Or maybe it\\'s vice versa. Either way: spend time with kids. - SMILE AT STRANGERS. A lot of old people seem angry all the time. I\\'m going to smile at people in creepy ways. They won\\'t even be able to look at me, the light from smile will be too bright.Either that or they will think I\\'m a pervert. Either one. I\\'m ok with it. I\\'m 106. I\\'m ok with anything. - EAT SMALL PORTIONS. The other day Claudia threw out all of our 15 inch plates. She was listening to one of my podcasts. \"People who have 15 inch plates eat 30% more calories on average\". The cause of almost every major illness is how you eat. So I guess eating on 8 inch plates will give you a chance to live to 107. Or three inch plates. I\\'ll switch to three inch plates. - HAVE FRIENDS. I wish I had more friends. How many people can I call right this second and make some jokes with. Do you think I can have a friend at 106 that I can call and talk to and laugh with. I hope so. I want to be able to call a friend and just be silent on the phone while we do our thing. - LAUGH. Amy Schumer put out a video yesterday that\\'s a fake rap video with girls \"twerking\" and a fake rap song about the object of fascination being a \"poop machine\". I laughed because \"poop machine\" was funny. I hope I still laugh at things with the word \"poop\" in it. - PLAY CATCH. My daughter and I got to an event almost two hours early. There was nobody even in the parking lot. It turns out I had a tennis ball in the trunk. We played catch for an hour and made up all sorts of games around it. She was laughing. Do you know how hard it is for a father to make his 16 year old girl laugh?Answer: it\\'s impossible. But playing catch did it. And laughter leads to a longer life. Which means playing leads to a longer life. I want to play. - I WILL NEVER CARE ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK. Why should I? I\\'m 106 years old. Beat that! I can walk around the street naked and the worst they will do is just take me home and tell my great-great grandkids that maybe I need \"help\". But, if they know me, my grandkids will wink and just say, \"thanks. We\\'ll take over from here.\" Take over! - NOT OWN ANYTHINGAm I really going to be sentimental about anything at that age. I\\'m about to die. All sentiments die with me. All my past dies with me. I don\\'t need any extra clothes. Or plates. or furniture. Or sheets. Or extra towels. Whenever I need a towel I\\'ll just hit the 3D printing machine in the bathroom, get the towel, and then put it back in to be reused when I\\'m done. Will I need photos? Why waste time looking at the past when I\\'ll have people I love in my present. If I\\'m 106 I hope there\\'s even more people around me that I love than now. - LEARN. This sounds trite. Everyone says \"learn something new every day\". But you would think at 106 I would get tired of learning new things. Today so far I\\'ve learned that the exact things that bring creative partnerships together also often end them. Opposites attract (Jobs and Wozniak, Lennon and McCartney) but often the \"opposite\" becomes too much to handle and people split apart. That\\'s ok. You then meet new opposites. You learn to love many opposites. Elon Musk doesn\\'t build spaceships. He finds his opposites that do. Then he moves on to the next thing. At age 106, why should I care? Because it\\'s fun! Maybe then I\\'ll put on a Beatles song. Like \"Yesterday\". - DEAD PEOPLE CAN GO TO HELL FOR ALL I CARE. Claudia might be dead before me. She insists on it actually. Will I be sad? I\\'m going to be about to see her. Or not. Either way. Because there\\'s nothing I can do about it. - NO WORRIES. Right now I\\'m involved in maybe too many things. I think about each thing. When I\\'m 106 I\\'m not going to think about ANYTHING. Most thinking is really boring and useless. If I stop writing this for a second, I can hear something I didn\\'t hear one minute ago because I was so focused on writing: birds singing. If I just don\\'t think I bet I can hear more singing. Naked people singing. Why not?- THE ADVICE I HOPE I GIVE WHEN I\\'M 106. When I\\'m 106 years old I think my only advice will be this: don\\'t predict anything. My 13 year old daughter told me two days ago she was going to be sick yesterday. \"All my friends are sick and I\\'m not getting any sleep so I know I\\'ll be sick.\" I told her that second to write it down that she will be sick tomorrow. What happened? She didn\\'t get sick. I have yet to meet anyone who can predict the future. Today I got an email from an economist friend of mine. He told me his predictions were right: we\\'re experiencing deflation in the economy and we\\'ll all be ruined. So I pulled up his email from exactly one year ago today. He was predicting \"spiraling inflation\" that would \"ruin the economy.\" I sent him his email from last year. Waiting for a response still. He won\\'t respond to me because I know deep down he doesn\\'t like me. Because people in their 40s don\\'t like people a lot of the time. One thing I do know: WE CAN NEVER PREDICT OUR OWN BEST INTERESTS. Bad things happen. And we get scared and sad about them. And then they turn out to be good things. One time, a guy who had funded me to run a hedge fund pulled all the money away from me. He was very angry. He said, \"I don\\'t care if you make or lose money for me. I care that you didn\\'t return my calls.\" We didn\\'t talk for five years after that. I felt very bad. I would avoid walking on his corner in NYC because maybe I would run into him. I was ashamed. Now, eight years later, we talk almost every day and we do a lot of business together. The only way things stay bad is if you clutch to your heart the \"badness\" of the experience. An experience is only \"bad\" if you label it that way. It\\'s all your choice. If you let go of that bad feeling, then you invite in good things to replace it. That sounds simplistic. But, hey, you can\\'t live to 106 if life is complicated.  Where does money lie into all of this. Well, if you\\'re 106 you don\\'t need to worry about money. You\\'re going to probably die quickly. But what about when you\\'re younger? Don\\'t you need to worry about money? Yes. But only if you don\\'t do the things I describe above. You don\\'t have to believe me on this. I only know this is true for me. I can only do one thing in my brain at a time: either worry about money, or do something else. The \"something else\" is more likely to make me money than worrying about money. So play, laugh, learn, love, be simplistic, listen to a bird, don\\'t own anything, don\\'t give a shit, no grudges, don\\'t predict anything, don\\'t assume something is bad, call a friend, and be excited about what is on your plate today (your three inch plate). Dear James at 106, I hope you are doing all of these things. Because these are the things I intend to do today.]',\n",
       "  26: '[I feel inadequate. And there\\'s not much I can do about it. Or even want to do about it. I actually like the feeling. I had a lunch today with a guy who worked in the mailroom at Hannah-Barbera which made all my cartoon favorites from the 70s: The Flintstones, Scooby-Doo, The Jetsons, and so on. He used to pitch ideas every day to Joe Barbera. \"I was working in the mailroom but I kept coming up with ideas for cartoons. I would send them up to Joe Barbera and I had no idea if he would like them or not. Then eventually he pulled me over and I started helping on all the scripts.\" I mentioned some of my favorite cartoons from the 70s. \"You know that one with Scooby Doo and the Harlem Globetrotters?\" I said. \"I wrote all of those,\" he said. \"What about Space Ghost?\" \"I wrote that. \"What about the Jetsons?\" \"Wrote it.\" And so on. Impressive guy. He killed himself at one thing for 30 years and wrote all these classics I grew up on. I\\'ve met or interviewed so many people in the last year. In the last five years. In the last 25 years. People who have amazed me. I try to learn from them and sometimes I can learn a little bit. When I meet someone I try to learn one thing that I will never forget. It adds up.Like how someone got inspired by a pencil to build a hundred schools in third world countries (Adam Braun) or about someone who wrote lyrics every day while 97% of his friends were killed by the time his childhood was over and then he made the bestselling song of 1995 (Coolio). Or the Congressman obsessed with meditation Or the other congressman who is now running for President. Or the 72 year old who runs the largest beer company in the country. Or people who work 90 hours a week chasing their dreams. I admit: I\\'m not really that driven. I like to read. I like to write. I like to tell my story. You know what my basic story is? Fear. I was desperately afraid I couldn\\'t feed my family. I made a lot of money. I thought I would never have to worry forever. Then I fell in love with someone. Then I lost it all. Made it back. Lost. Made. Lost. Made. What a roller coaster! I wasn\\'t making dreams. I just wanted to feed my family. I think I came up with a strategy to keep me balanced. To allow me to grow and flourish instead of just worry. But really, past that, I don\\'t care. I\\'m happy I feed my family now after such a roller coaster. I don\\'t want to own a basketball team. Or end aging. Or go to the moon. At some point I gave myself permission:\\nIt\\'s ok if you don\\'t know what you want to do next.\\nIt\\'s ok if you\\'re scared. Scared shitless. \\nIt\\'s ok to not write a bestselling novel. \\nIt\\'s ok to leave early.\\nIt\\'s ok to not be a billionaire. \\nIt\\'s ok to not start a charity that ends malaria.\\nIt\\'s ok to get fired or to fail. Or even worse, to lose someone\\'s money. That happens sometimes.\\n I try hard at everything I love. When I love something I want to obsess on every part of it. This has caused me problems in relationships when I obsess.  It\\'s ok to be in hard situations that you can\\'t solve. This is why I have to remind myself every day to focus on health. Be around good people. Be creative. Be grateful. Once a day I save my life by reminding myself of that.  That\\'s ok that I have to remind myself of that or lose everything. Again. It\\'s ok if not everyone likes me. Sometimes it surprises me who doesn\\'t like me. I think I get surprised like that at least once a day. I got surprised like that yesterday. It\\'s ok to be \"stuck\" sometimes. To know that you have talents but to have no idea how or when or why to apply them. Being stuck is a huge signal it\\'s to time to change. That\\'s not a bad thing. It\\'s a good thing.  It\\'s ok to take time ordering.  It\\'s ok to not have opinions. Whenever you argue, people are always ready with pointy sharp facts. If one person has the facts for X, then another has the facts for -X.  There\\'s lots of intelligence tests out there. Like: Google asks these questions at interviews. How marbles would fit in all of outerspace? I look at those questions. I can\\'t answer any of them. That\\'s ok too.  Sometimes I forget to return an email. I really liked a person and they sent an email and then I forget to reply. I look back months later and see I made a draft but never hit send. Sometimes that\\'s ok. But sometimes it prevents me from being friends with people I like. I like beating my 13 year old daughter at tennis! But guess what? We played for the first time in months this past weekend and she was hitting stronger and faster. Pretty soon she will beat me. I guess that\\'s ok also. Children should get better than their parents. A friend of mine is a super-genius. He stopped by yesterday to show me his latest invention. He came up with a new molecule to put into a \"vaping\" device (an electronic device that lets you smoke without the actual smoke.)He made a special concoction so instead of smoking nicotine he\\'s the first person to ever smoke vitamins. We loaded it up with vitamin B12 and each took about 10,000 times the recommended daily allowance. He took his blood before and after. Sure enough, 10,000 times more b12 was in his blood than before. He said, \"this goes right into the bloodstream. As opposed to taking it in pill form where none of it goes into the bloodstream. That whole $28 billion vitamin industry is a scam.\" We vaped Vitamin B12 for about an hour and then I went to my cartoonist lunch and then over to do a podcast with Stephen Dubner who wrote Freakonomics. I was thinking to myself, \"I\\'m the second person in history to smoke Vitamin B12. I\\'m like the Buzz Aldrin of that vitamin.Claudia incidentally, was number three. We\\'re vita-nauts. Dubner and I were talking about what the saddest truth in life was. He said, as if it were obvious, \"you mean other than dying?\". I said dying to me sounded like the happiest truth about living. That being born was a pretty sad truth. Once your born you have to excrete food for the rest of your life. That\\'s like God\\'s punishment for eating that apple. Once we were eating apples we had to shit them out. I said I wouldn\\'t mind if I died tomorrow. I\\'m not depressed or anything. But life has been pretty good to me so I don\\'t really sweat dying. It\\'s ok if I want to die occasionally without being depressed. Who cares? We all have to die sometime. Dubner and I did six straight podcasts in a row. We\\'re probably going to release the podcasts in a month or so. I had a lot of fun. Not because of the podcasts but because we\\'ve been friends for 15 years almost. I\\'m vaguely ahead in a backgammon match that we started in 2003. What are you up to next? he said when we were leaving the studioI said, I don\\'t know. Probably go home and go to sleep. I\\'m pretty tired. It\\'s ok if I go to sleep at 7pm if I\\'m tired. And that\\'s exactly what I did. A day in the life.(In photo: Choose Yourself vs Freakonomics author Stephen Dubner)]',\n",
       "  27: '[(click here for full image)The best way to \"choose yourself\" is to help others. There\\'s never in history been such a thing as people doing it by themselves. There are no \"lone geniuses\". The other day I mentioned come creative pairs. I\\'ll mention more: George Lucas and Marcia Lucas (Marcia was the editor on Star Wars and is the only \"Lucas\" to win an Oscar). Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg. Watson and Crick (DNA). The \"lone genius\" is a myth. Part of choosing yourself means you get to choose your scene. Means you HAVE to choose your scene. Because that catapults your emotional health. And it\\'s not just a pair either. Lennon/McCartney had Harrison and Starr (not to mention their managers, etc). Bill Gates / Paul Allen had Steve Ballmer and the dozen or so people in the initial launch of Microsoft. And it\\'s not just a small group either. There\\'s the massive industries and then society itself that confers it\\'s blessing on the people who choose themselves and create and bring things to the world that solve problems and demonstrate value. How do you find your scene? How do you find the people to share ideas with? How do you find people who are also trying to improve 1% per day on physical emotional mental and spiritual health? You go out and meet them. You find partners there. You share there. You network there. You find friends there. My best moments in the past year is when I\\'ve gone out of my way to meet new friends and partners. What bliss it has been for someone shy like me. Meetups have been happening all over the world in the past few months. Here\\'s where meetups are currently being organized. You can start one and you\\'ll network and help people and meet like-minded people. Or you can go to one of the meetups on this map. Or join the FB group (cc Choose Yourself) where meetups are being formed. The beauty of this is that it is happening without me. People are choosing themselves to create these opportunities to define their scene. Once you find your scene, you grow up with them. You solve problems with them. You create art and innovation and magic and change the world with them.(Photo courtesy of Tom Sullivan during the first ever San Diego Choose Yourself Meetup)]',\n",
       "  28: '[He dropped out of high school. Started a company that didn\\'t work. Read a lot. Then started another company. He wanted me to advise his company. I didn\\'t do it. But we spoke for awhile about his being a high school dropout.He said, \"Once I figured out how I can learn to learn then I didn\\'t need school anymore.\" I didn\\'t know whether to believe him. But I liked that phrase, \"learn to learn\". He made an app that didn\\'t work. Nobody wanted it. Not even his friends who said they wanted it. I was thinking a year or two later: thank god I didn\\'t advise that company. So he backed off and asked himself why the app wasn\\'t as popular as he thought it would be. Nobody can predict the future. A Harvard PhD and a high school dropout have equal skills at prophecy. He called up the top people at many companies and asked them if there was any part of his app that they would want. He met with maybe 50 heads of technology at all sorts of different companies in different industries. He figured out what their problems were. He listened and studied. Then he rewrote his app. Just slightly. He also rewrote the way he described the app. Just slightly. It\\'s now four years later. I\\'m not saying the name of his company because I don\\'t know if news was announced yet. But he just raised $60 million at a $250 million valuation. He\\'s on track for great revenues this year. My friend who was giving me this update said, \"I\\'ve never seen anything like this. He has a 100% close rate on his sales calls. Everyone buys.\" Is he uneducated? Of course not. He reads constantly. Maybe more than anyone I know. Did he not get networked enough? Of course not. He created his network by helping them solve their problems. If I\\'m not mistaken, Google is one of his top investors. Do I regret not advising his company? No. I\\'m not a very good advisor I think. I like to sit in my room with the shades closed. If you go for every opportunity you end up chasing everyone else\\'s dreams except your own. It\\'s good to know what you are good at and what you are not so good at. I like to deliver value my own way. Everything has turned upside down. FOR THE FIRST GENERATION IN HISTORY, since Julius Caesar, we are on track to make less money than the generation before us. And with $1.2 trillion in college debt to pay back on top of it. This is not just in America. The entire world is having this problem. This generation will make less than the generation before. We were all told to go to school and get a job and incomes would rise. We were all told a lie. Admittedly, we have some good things going for us. I can take any course I want for almost free. I can read books on my kindle.I have a computer (courtesy of college dropouts like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates) and I can always see what my friends are up to (courtesy of college dropout Mark Zuckerberg) and I can even diagnose any diseases I have cheaper than ever (courtesy of college dropout Elizabeth Holmes). I can stay informed if I want (but I don\\'t) courtesy of an expelled college student (Ted Turner) and I can eat healthy (courtesy of college dropout Whole Foods founder John Mackay). You can say, these are all anecdotes. That\\'s true! I have no defense. And yet, I can read, write, connect, eat, stay healthy, etc so I have time and energy to learn. I\\'m an anecdote also. I went to college and then graduate school. Was thrown out of graduate school (coincidentally by the friend I had dinner with last night who told me the update about the high school dropout). I then started to read everything I wanted. I then started to live the life I wanted to live. But it took a long time. I had many passions. I\\'m still working my way through them.I hope it doesn\\'t take so long for my own daughters. I hope they learn how to learn. I read one study that shows that 45 minutes after kids leave a lecture they can\\'t remember anything said in the lecture.Here are the only ways you can learn something. College or no college:\\nDo it.\\nWatch it.\\nRead it.\\nThink about it.\\nTalk about it tomorrow. Talk about it the day after that. \\nLove it.\\nRepeat. Repeat. Repeat.\\nI have no study to quote on this. This just an anecdote also. This is the only way I learn. I want to home-college my kids. I know they have passions and interests. I want them to explore those instead of wasting time on useless things they will forget. Then they need to put those passions to work. You change the world by changing yourself. That\\'s how you unwrap the unique gift you can give everyone else. Here are the skills they need to learn that are specifically NOT taught in college:(Click here to view full image)]',\n",
       "  29: '[Kid musicals are the worst. Can you imagine: waking up and saying, \"I have to see that awful musical being put on by 10 year olds today instead of doing anything else in the entire world.\" But it reminds me of a story. Theodore Geisel \\'s first book \"And To Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street\" came out in 1937. It had been rejected 26 times by publishers. This is one of those stories of: and then it got accepted. Because it did. On the 27th time. I would\\'ve given up. Probably #20. I would\\'ve said: \"I\\'m no good at this\". And I would\\'ve switched to something else. There\\'s nothing wrong with switching. In fact, I did switch.I wrote novels, they got rejected. I switched. I\\'m a quitter and a switcher. A quit-switcher. But then I did other things that I loved. And I got a little better at them. I was a quit-switcher but not a switch-quitter. I kept switching until I found something I loved. People write me and say, \"I give up. I failed\". They are very depressed. I ask them their age. 22. Sometimes they are 52. It doesn\\'t matter. It\\'s ok to jump from table to table, knocking everything off. To Quit and Switch. Quit and Switch. You don\\'t need to submit the 27th time.The problem is this: when you first do something you love, you realize how bad you are at it. Because you love work done by masters while you are still an amateur. So you are too stupid to quit but smart enough that you see the huge gap between you and someone who is good. You close the gap with love and persistence. That\\'s why persistence + love = mastery.Persistence means you get 1% better every day, no matter how you add it up. Love means you begin to see the subtleties that nobody else sees. From there it takes a long time. A lot of persistence and a lot of love. If you don\\'t have the persistence and love, it\\'s ok to quit-switch. Persistence and Love are not about fame. Or not about money. It\\'s like a kiss. Two people afraid at first, stumbling unsure. It might take many kisses. You search. You fumble around. Finally, it\\'s about the moment where you meet each other in the middle. I didn\\'t have enough faith in myself. I didn\\'t have enough faith in my work. I didn\\'t have enough faith in a system where a handful of people could reject me. So I didn\\'t love and I didn\\'t persist. All of that has changed now. There\\'s a new system - a system without gatekeepers. And there are things I love enough to try and find the subtleties that were once hidden. If Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss) gave up on the 26th try we would never have his second book: The Cat in the Hat. We would have no Grinch and no Green Eggs.There wouldn\\'t be my father reading, \"Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are?\" as I fell to sleep. Long before he became mentally ill when he would forget his own luck. Last year, according to Brian Grazer\\'s book, \"A Curious Mind\" (I highly recommend), Dr. Seuss\\'s books sold almost 4 million copies even though he\\'s been dead for 25 years. This weekend I watched my daughter perform as \"The Cat in the Hat\" in the local musical \"Seussical\". If Dr. Seuss hadn\\'t tried that 27th time I wouldn\\'t have seen her light up the stage. It made me happy to see that. I\\'m glad Dr. Seuss tried the 27th time. \"The Cat in the Hat\" is a mischievous character. He teaches the little kids to break the rules. If you worry too much about the future, you can\\'t enjoy your now. Dr. Seuss knew that. He taught us that. I try to remember. That when someone says \"No\" to you, you\\'re allowed to ask (silently or not) \"Why?\" and \"Why not?\"I hate plays. I hate musicals. I hate sitting for 90 minutes on uncomfortable chairs in uncomfortable gyms. I also dislike failure porn: \"if so-and-so didn\\'t submit that last time there would be no Grinch, no Harry Potter, no Luke Skywalker, no Google, no light bulb.\" It\\'s ok to not make that final try. To live your life the way you want. To try many things. To love many types of subtlety. It\\'s only when you quit switching that you begin to die. But I\\'m glad Theodore Geissel had faith and persistence. So I could watch my baby girl, maybe for the last time, sing and dance like a great big cat.]',\n",
       "  30: '[I had to interrupt him. I was too curious. I thought I would die if I didn\\'t ask.Whenever you are curious about something, don\\'t forget to ask a question. Curious. Question....Curious ==&gt; Question. The only things you will ever remember are the questions you ask when you are curious. Curiosity is the ONLY technique for learning.I was talking with a guy who was incredibly inspiring and he seemed to really know what his purpose in life was. So I got curious. I asked him how anyone could find out what their passion is. The people who feel stuck in their lives. He said: Imagine you have a billion dollars. Think of all the things you can do now. Subtract out everything that is a luxury. For me, for instance, I\\'d hire someone to do all my shopping and maybe bathe me. I have to subtract that because that\\'s like a luxury. I asked Claudia. She said she\\'d fly to Buenos Aires. I said, \"You can do that right this second. That\\'s all you can think of if you got a billion dollars?\" Maybe she just wants to get away from me until I shower. But anyway, subtract the bigger house, the boat, the trips, the chefs, the assistants, the bigger car, the plane. What would you DO? Not what you would HAVE.Now...figure out how to that thing RIGHT NOW. Without the billion dollars. Naveen Jain told me this technique. He\\'s going to the moon. He started moonexpress.com. He\\'s already developed a lunar lander. NASA agrees it will work. He\\'s going to head over to the moon by 2020 and I believe him. One of the smartest people I\\'ve ever spoken to. He wakes up at 4:30am and reads constantly about the things he\\'s interested in: space research, medical research, neuroscience. He said also, \"let\\'s say you want to be a philanthropist\". This doesn\\'t mean give all your money away. He said, \"you still have to make it sustainable. So it\\'s okay if it\\'s a sustainable business.\" For instance, if he can get to the moon, he can mine for rare earth minerals which are quite valuable here. Then once it\\'s a sustainable business he can achieve his true objectives, which is to use the moon as a sort of launching pad for other planets. I like this. He didn\\'t need money to do this dream. He\\'s rich but he raised the money, he hired the scientists, he mapped out the dream, he found the business model, and in 2020 he\\'s going to land on the moon. I\\'m going to add to this. Someone asked me yesterday what I thought about Warren Buffett\\'s \"5/25\" technique: A) Write down the top 25 things you want to do with your life. B) Focus on the first 5C) NEVER EVER FOCUS AGAIN on the next 20. AVOID THEM. They are only distractions if you truly want to be good at the first five.I actually think it\\'s wrong to focus on the first five. Focus maybe on the first two or three. Of the 105 people who have been on my podcast I can tell you the first two for every single one of them. For example: Mark Cuban: Money and basketball. Coolio: Rap and cooking.Claudia: Yoga and writing. I love to write things that will help people. I love to entertain. I don\\'t need a billion dollars to do that but if I had a billion dollars I would do those things.Well, what if you have no money? I had no money. And it took years to figure out how to do the things I wanted to do. For all 105 of my podcast guests it took them years. But if I had a billion dollars, I\\'d do the things I\\'m doing right now.And I\\'d keep trying to get better at them. I have other things on my list also. I wish I could paint. I wish I could play the piano better. I wish I could run a billion revenue business. But you know what: I\\'m not going to focus on those things. They are not in my top three. Maybe they are somewhere around 15-20. I\\'m going to give you one other technique for finding purpose. The Plan B technique. Otherwise known as the morning after pill. It\\'s the morning after and you realize your absolute #1 dream didn\\'t work out. But divide the dream into categories. Ok, I like to entertain. That might mean write, or it might mean speak, or it might mean, write fiction, or it might mean ten other things. So do this and tell me what happens:\\nthe \"you have a billion dollars\" technique\\nthe \"5/25\" technique\\nthe Plan B technique\\nOh, one more technique: \"the one thing technique\". What ONE THING can you do today to move forward a tiny tiny bit on what you are left with when you do the above. Maybe it just means find one thing you are curious about. Ask a question.I wrote this post. I\\'m going to shower.]',\n",
       "  31: '[Rich Roll was having a heart attack on his staircase. He was fat. He hated his work. He was unhappy. A few years later he ran, swam, biked, 703 miles in seven days when he was 45 years old. When he was 40 he had a job he was unhappy at but he was still trying to live the American dream: the two cars, the beautiful family, partnership at a law firm.\"I thought I was having a heart attack on the staircase,\" he said. \"I was 50 pounds overweight. I was working 80 hours a week. I wasn\\'t happy. I was going to die.\" That moment on the staircase was one of three or four turning points in Rich Roll\\'s life that forced him to say: \"I have a small window to change for the better.\" And then he did it.But what\\'s interesting to me is that Rich Roll is an addict. I\\'m an addict. Many people I know are addicts. Many addictions are bad for you. When I was younger I was addicted to just about everything that could possibly be harmful to me.Rich Roll, when he was 31 years old and a high-priced lawyer, had to check himself into a 100 day rehab after he was drunk-driving the wrong way down a one way street.While in rehab he noticed something interesting. \"At first it felt really horrible, and then it felt better.\"When he was 40, he wasn\\'t drinking but he threw those obsessions into his NEXT unhealthy addiction. \"I was living on the window diet\" - if you can drive up to a window and order the food then that\\'s what he would eat. Like three Wendy\\'s cheeseburgers.He threw himself into the lifestyle of top lawyer, 80 hours a week, eat whatever you can. But that moment on the stairs made him realize, with heart disease in his family, that he was at risk.So he started a seven day cleanse. All juices.\"In the first three days I felt horrible, but I knew from my experience in rehab that it would get a lot better\".And it did. At the end of the juicing he felt incredibly energetic and cleansed.This was his third addiction. Gradually he went from juicing to a \"junk vegetarian\" style (pizza, etc) to real plant-based vegan lifestyle.\"I had so much energy I couldn\\'t stop moving. Even sitting at rest I couldn\\'t stop tapping my leg.\"So one day he went for a run. He ran 24 miles. His biggest run prior that was 8 miles!And that was 22 years earlier. Sorry, Rich, if I\\'m getting the numbers slightly wrong.After that he realized this was some latent ability that was coming out so he started to train.He trained every day. He started running in \"Iron Man\" competitions. Then the competitions got more and more intense until he did his 700 mile Hawaii run. 5 Irons Mans in 7 days.This was his fourth addiction.He was named one of the 50 fittest men in the world.But he was still a lawyer part-time and training part-time.He wrote a book about his lifestyle. ... He started giving talks for free. Going to conferences. Spreading the world on this healthy lifestyle that had changed his life, invigorated his relationships, and catapulted him to being one of the healthiest people in the world.This was his fifth addiction. He couldn\\'t stop spreading the word about what was happening to him.\"It was hard at first,\" he said. \"I wasn\\'t getting paid and I was traveling everywhere.\" Gradually he started making a living at his new career and he gave up his job as a lawyer.His book \"Plantpower\" is about to come out, describing his lifestyle even more. Rich and I are one year apart in age. I can\\'t even run down the block although I try to live a healthy lifestyle.People always demonize addiction. It\\'s bad! Don\\'t be an addict!But there are positive addictions. \"Well-being\" is being addicted to three things: Competence, Positive relationships, Autonomy. And maybe one more thing: Growth every day in all three of those areas. If you do those things, I can tell you you will feel well-being today, no matter what else is going on in your life. The first few days or weeks or months are really hard and then as Rich says, \"suddenly it gets better.\" When I was talking to Rich for an upcoming podcast, he would use the same language often when describing a bad addiction and a positive addiction.\\n\"I noticed I had to change\"\\n\"It was hard at first to get over it but I knew it would get better\"\\nIt was all-consuming for him and obviously, negative or positive, he loved the lifestyle\\nHis family and friends were super-supportive and those were the people who gravitated towards.\\nWhen he went from negative to positive in his life he also suddenly went from AMBITION to MEANING.\\nThere\\'s a lot of great books recently about habits and developing positive habits. A positive habit might be: brush your teeth twice a day. make your bed in the morning.What\\'s the difference between a habit and an addiction? I think there is a gray area here but roughly - a habit you can control. An addiction feels out of your control.I bet that if Rich didn\\'t exercise for a week he would feel physically ill. I bet exercising and health are addictions for him.  What happened to Rich Roll?He told me that during his time in rehab, someone asked him, \"are you a human being having a spiritual experience or a spiritual being having a human experience\".He said the question threw him off. He had never even thought in those terms before.It was always the straight line: school, law school, lawyer, partner, family, two car garage, retirement.What does that question even mean?The truth is: it doesn\\'t have to mean anything. It just has to make you think. It has to give you a little bump off the straight line. To tear you apart a little inside so you realize there\\'s a world outside the one you\\'ve been living in.  I try to turn on my inner addict every day. I look at what I\\'m doing and I try to be competent, have good relationships, and the freedom to do what I want. Or grow towards those things. Maybe it means meet new people. Or be creative in some way. Or try to get better at something. Or start saying \"No\" more to the people who are trying to direct my life in ways good for them but not for me. If I do that, I know I will get excited and my inner addict will turn on. And everyone\\'s inner addict is different. I will NEVER run 100 miles. Or even one mile. But every six months my life has changed almost 100% as a result.It\\'s a gradual process. You can\\'t be a \"positive addict\" overnight.But when you \"invest in yourself\" as Rich told me he started doing, the universe conspires to help you find the right answers to questions that have no meaning.I\\'m an addict and proud of it.

       "  32: '[\"There are three types of people,\" astronaut Chris Hadfield told me, \"-1, 0, and +1\".Chris Hadfield spent 166 days in space in the space station ISS.While there he also sang \"Space Oddity\" and uploaded (or can you say \"downloaded\" in this case) the video to YouTube where it was viewed 25 million times.When a business fails it feels like a -1. When a relationship fails, often it\\'s because I\\'ve been a -1. Certainly stalking and begging and crying has made me a -1 many times.When I clam up in my shell, refusing to take responsibility, afraid to return calls, afraid to admit responsibility, that\\'s -1 behavior. When I think I\\'m a +1, often I\\'m a -1.Even worse, even much worse, is when other people think you are a -1.There\\'s a saying, \"it\\'s none of my business what people think of me\".But sayings are fun to say and hard to live.When people think I\\'m a -1 I have a tendency to add all of those people up. Sometimes that makes me a -1000.Claudia says, \"trust me, a 1000 people aren\\'t thinking of you.\"I said to her, \"but what about the 1000 voices in my head. All shouting \"BAD!\"\"Being a +1 is usually too difficult to me. I never know what I\\'m doing.For instance, one time I was CEO of a company that was my idea. I was very good at raising money. We raised $30 million.I had no idea how much money we made. What our costs were. I didn\\'t even know what our product did. I had bought it with the money we raised.I was so afraid to talk to people, I would get in early and lock the door behind me and not answer the door when people knocked.Eventually they fired me as CEO. Then they fired me from the board. Then they took my shares away. I went from a \"+1\" to a \"-1\" very quickly.It\\'s good to be a zero sometimes. To learn and listen and help.When I do a podcast I feel like a zero.I ask people to come on my podcast because I want to learn something from them. How to be a better person. They are +1 people. I\\'d like to be like them. So I ask them questions.Here are the qualities of a zero. LISTEN to what people tell you. Maybe they experienced something you have never experienced.Our brain can curate the experiences of others so maybe it can help us live our own lives better. OBSERVE what people do.We have what are called \"mirror neurons\". If I think I\\'m a +1 in \"firing a gun\" I might shoot myself and kill myself.If I watch someone over and over firing a gun then my mirror neurons kick in and I might be able to do it myself if asked.Although I hope nobody asks me. HUMILITY.Some people are great people. They are kind. They are humble. They are productive. They are competent. They get things done. Then they get AMAZING things done.When you compare, you despair. When you are humble, you learn. When you get curious, you get better.How did they get this way? Oh! They read some books. They wrote some books. They had some ideas. They worked hard every day for years. They saved some lives.Ok. Now I learned from them. Maybe I can do some of that also. 1/10 of that if I\\'m lucky. CURIOSITYA zero starts with:\\nWhat are they doing?\\nHow are they doing it?\\nHow can I help?\\nHow can I get better?\\nHow can I be competent. Then build trust? Then build excellence?\\n THEMES INSTEAD OF GOALSChris Hadfield wanted to be an astronaut for 21 years before he became the commander of the International Space Station for 166 days. Sometimes he had disappointments along the way.\"If I had only focused on big successes,\" he said, \"then I would be disappointed most of the time. You have to focus on the small successes and make sure to celebrate them.\"He had a theme of being competent. Of helping the astronaut program. Of being an astronaut. Of working towards the common goals of a program he believed in. He achieved many many small successes that way. And then he sang \"Space Oddity\" while circling the Earth 2600 times in a row on a 92 million mile trip he took.Here\\'s the video. Watch it.People tend to think they are meant for something BIG in their lives. I understand that. But to get to BIG you have to focus on today.I have to keep quoting Chris. \"Continually investing in the success of others is what will eventually lead to success for yourself.\" RESPECTOne person can lead a company. But it takes thousands of employees, customers, investors, fans, etc to really create a success.A good follower observes the leader, trusts his suggestions, and then ties his own success to the success of the company.When I worked at HBO I only started to feel like I was accomplishing something when my language changed from \"they\" (referring to HBO) to \"we\".I was a zero there. But I watched all of their shows, learned enough of their vision, learned their history, followed the lead of their executives, until I could make my own contribution.My contribution was big enough that other companies started to approach me and ask me if I could help them also.So I started my first company. I haven\\'t had a job since. NO ENTITLEMENTI admit, sometimes I get angry feeling like a zero. I want to be a +1 all the time, at everything I do.I get competitive. I want to be the best at this, or the best at that. RIGHT NOW.But one thing I always know, feeling entitled to anything will automatically put a ceiling on what you get out of life.Do you know someone who is feeling entitled? Is he angry most of the time?Entitled people are the ones who later say, \"I should\\'ve been X\" and they are bitter and then life is over.Entitlement. Ceiling...Entitlement. Ceiling. I have to remind myself of that all the time.A +1 combined with entitlement can easily make you a -1 within seconds.It\\'s important to realize that what\\'s most important is paying attention to the things that are not important. DON\\'T BE DISAPPOINTEDOne time Chris Hadfield had a serious setback when France gave away his slot for their test pilot program to another person for political reasons.He was disappointed: \"I\\'m not going to become an astronaut\". He heard Air Canada was hiring pilots. He considered taking a job there.His wife, Helene, said, \"You don\\'t really want to be a pilot. You wouldn\\'t be happy and then I wouldn\\'t be happy\". Don\\'t give up on being an astronaut - I can\\'t let you do that to yourself or to us.\"She said that and he didn\\'t go for the job and he ended up in outer space.Sometimes 0 + 0 = +1.This isn\\'t a story about math. Or being a success. Or being an astronaut. Or achieving all your dreams.This is a love story.  About James:James Altucher is a successful entrepreneur, chess master, investor and best seller author.

       "  33: '[I wrote a blog post that was horrible. Claudia said, \"People won\\'t relate.\"I rewrote it completely. She said, \"much better\". I published it and that practically ruined my life. I loved it so much. I became obsessed with blogging. I read every day. I wrote every day. Eventually I rewrote some stuff and made books out of them. Some of the books became bestsellers.Claudia went over each book and told me what to take out and what to keep in. Then she worked on the design of each book. Then she worked on the publishing of each book. She says, \"these are practically my books\". Then I started giving talks. I started getting paid to be on boards or give advice. People were buying my books. I started a newsletter. I get many opportunities because of the writing. All because I kept a discipline of writing every day. But that\\'s NOT what did it. That\\'s not what I\\'m writing about.What did it for me was having a partner. A partner that helped me get things done. A partner that filled in the gaps of my creativity. There\\'s no such thing as a lone genius. Every Steve Jobs has a Steve Wozniak. Every Marie Curie has a Pierre Curie. Every Lennon has a McCartney. Even the most isolated genius (Picasso) had a Braque. Claudia now has a book out. It\\'s been #1 in her category since it came out. Now people are paying HER to give talks. For five years, I\\'ve helped edit every one of Claudia\\'s blog posts. I take out words. I take out paragraphs. I take out half the article. We even do a podcast together. Ugh, it sounds like I\\'m bragging. I\\'m not. The reverse. I used to write boring stuff about stocks.Now I write about those ugly places where my past intersects with my present. Where I\\'m trying to still get through the prickly needles that give me pain every time my mind remembers. I couldn\\'t do that without a partner. Writing is ultimately something you do by yourself. But finding someone who helps you move beyond what you would be by yourself is the key to making something that stands out. Doesn\\'t have to be a spouse. I can tell you - maybe it shouldn\\'t be. And it doesn\\'t have to end well (Lennon and McCartney, Jobs and Wozniak, Freud and Jung). I look back at the 150 people or so I\\'ve interviewed for my podcasts. Artists, authors, billionaires, astronauts, creatives in every space. 100% of them (100% !) had their McCartney, or their Simone De Beauvoir, or their Sheryl Sandberg. Creativity wins when you take two minds that can complete each others sentences, but enough differences between them that your creativity lights on fire exploring those differences. With this one idea in mind, find the people who complete your sentences. List all your interests, go to meetups to meet like-minded people. Share your work online and see who is most excited. Get together with the people in your social network and come up with ideas for each other. See if 1+1 = infinity. We define the people around us. And they define us. Find the right dictionary. The key to creativity is to give to someone else. And for them to give back to you something better. Repeat._ _ _Creativity equals your partner + your skills. Here are still the 33 skills I feel I need to become a good writer. Am I a good writer? I have no idea. I\\'m honest and I try my best and I\\'ve had major pains. Meshing them together, I write about it. These are the 33 techniques I use to try and improve every day._ _ _About James:James Altucher is a successful entrepreneur, chess master, investor and best seller author.

       "  34: '[We were all beating each other up because of Jesus. We were six years old and half of us were Jews and half were Christians. I will tell you this: when I was growing up, my parents didn\\'t say nice things about Jesus. And, I can imagine, when my Christian friends were growing up, maybe they probably don\\'t hear nice things about Jews.This is not anti-semitism. This is normal. People are hatched into their little tribes and only later fly out of the nest.Black and white is easy for a six year old and only when we later roll around in the mud of life do we appreciate the beautiful color gray.Finally, Greg Fiorvanti stopped everyone from fighting. Someone had hit him in the face and he was crying and dirty.He yelled, \"Can we all just agree that Jesus was a great teacher?\" And then, just like we saw our fathers do every day, we went back and forth and shook hands with each other.Greg\\'s father was the CEO of MTV. We were all little white middle-class boys living in a little suburb near New York City. We were tiny Jihadists on a playground.My friends parent\\'s (Jews) didn\\'t like me because I always talked about how Jesus could walk on water. Like Superman. Moses was pretty impressive also. Someone should make one of those buddy-cop movies where Jesus and Moses are the cops. Or Yoda and Morgan Freeman. Thomas Jefferson spent his entire post-Presidency life devoted to coming up with an accurate story of Jesus. He didn\\'t like all the contradictions and varying stories of Jesus\\' life in the different gospels.He used a razor to cut passages out of the different gospels and paste them into one coherent book which he never published but it\\'s called \"The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth.\" He left out the miracles and the angels and anything supernatural because he felt this corrupted the original message of Jesus. He told John Adams those stories were used to placate the Romans who loved the stories of miracles in their own gods.He never published the book. He didn\\'t want to upset anyone. He did it for his own inspiration. Never taking anything as \"gospel\" he essentially composed his own set of beliefs just for himself and his own happiness.Leo Tolstoy, after he wrote \"War and Peace\" did the same thing and it took him about 30 years. In 1880 he published \"The Kingdom of God is Within You\". This book focused not on a supernatural heaven that waits us later but on the choices we can make today that can make us happy and inspiring: \"Turn the other cheek\".Gandhi, a Hindu, lists this book as the most influential book in his approach to non-violence when dealing with an oppressive government. Gandhi and Tolstoy wrote back and forth with each other for years. In these books, ONE thing stands out for me. And it\\'s extremely relevant in this era of \"outrage porn\". Everyone screaming all day long on the Internet about the slightest wrongs they can find in everyone else. Jesus says about the crowd who wants to stone the adulterer, \"let he who is blameless cast the first stone\".The older people leave first, then the younger people. Jesus isn\\'t paying attention. Oddly, he\\'s just doodling in the sand. No miracles. Finally, he asks the woman, \"Has no one condemned you?\" Almost as if he were daydreaming the entire time and didn\\'t notice what was happening. It\\'s probably weirdest story in the New Testament. She says, \"No, sir.\" And he says, \"I don\\'t condemn you either\".He DOESN\\'T say \"I forgive you.\" Forgiveness is not something you can give to others. It\\'s not like ice cream. Forgiveness is the gift I give myself. Forgiveness and anger and fear and hatred are all things that happen inside of ourselves. I know when I\\'m upset at someone, it ruins everything I touch after that. I can\\'t sleep. I can\\'t write. I can\\'t work.It\\'s like that cartoon of the guy typing and yelling: \"Honey, I can\\'t go to sleep right now! Someone is WRONG on the Internet!\" We choose for ourselves what we feel. When we let other people choose our feelings, we mirror their mediocrity. We mirror their weakness instead of choosing our strength.As the great Morgan Freeman says, \"Let me ask you something. If someone prays for patience, you think God gives them patience? Or does he give them the opportunity to be patient? If he prays for courage, does God give him courage, or does he give him opportunities to be courageous?\"The best way to help the other people in this extraordinary dream we are in is to wake up.And then what happens?Morgan Freeman again, \"You change the world.\"---About James:James Altucher is a successful entrepreneur, chess master, investor and best seller author.

       "  35: '[Not everyone can be a Mark Zuckerberg! Not everyone can be an Elizabeth Holmes, who dropped out of Stanford at 19, started a business in a basement, and is now a multi-billionaire. Not everyone can be a Bill Gates. Or a Beyonce (although Claudia wants to be Beyonce in her next life. Which I hope that means I come back as Jay-Z). Sometimes people say to me: \"not everyone can be X\". Not everyone can choose themselves! Or, \"Maybe focus on helping others instead of choosing yourself!\" Ok. I don\\'t argue. There are always exceptional people. But exceptions are created, they are not born. Every person on the planet is a future amazing anecdote right now. Here\\'s the questions I try to ask myself every day. Sometimes I forget. I try to follow my own advice and I get better at it. But like everything, it takes practice.  Is it better to be sick in bed, or to do one small thing a day to improve my health? Yesterday it was warm enough to play tennis. So I played with my daughter. Which is great because I get to exercise and also spend quality time with her. And also, she\\'s the only person I can beat although she\\'s getting better pretty fast. Is it better to be around people who will laugh at me and put me down? Or is it better to be around people who inspire me and who will support my dreams, even when they change every day? Like yesterday, I was obsessed with doing an impression of Morgan Freeman. Claudia put up with me for hours trying to talk like Morgan Freeman while she was doing her own work. Then I wrote down 15 jokes I can say about Morgan Freeman and both Claudia and my daughter picked out the funnier ones. Both were kind to me although Mollie said, \"You don\\'t sound anything like Morgan Freeman.\"  Is it better to try and be creative? Or is it better to be unoriginal in everything you do? This question is not easy to answer. \"If it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it\" means, \"sometimes you shouldn\\'t be original\". But still - it\\'s a fun exercise to try and be creative every day. Or to pretend to be Morgan Freeman.  Is it better to be grateful today? Or to complain? I try to find one thing I\\'m miserable about. Like, right this second, I can feel it in my stomach - I\\'m upset about some things people have said about me. That\\'s ok. It\\'s an opportunity to turn it into what I call a \"difficult gratitude problem\". If I can find ten things to be grateful about these people who said these things then my gratitude muscle will be improved. That sounds corny. But it\\'s better than being upset. Or dwelling. If I can answer all these questions then I know I will help others. How come? Because it\\'s a miracle that a tiny cloud can obscure the massive moon. Get rid of the clouds, and you can make it to the moon. Others can follow you there.- - -I don\\'t worry about anecdotes or exceptions. If you ask these questions every day and celebrate your small successes then you start to become the exception instead of the rule. And what is the rule? There are no rules.- - -About James:James Altucher is a successful entrepreneur, chess master, investor and best seller author.

       "  36: '[Steve Dinisio is the Angel of Death for failed businesses. When a business fails, the owner makes two calls. One to the bank and the next call to Steve. Steve sells their equipment, furniture, inventory, everything. Maybe he buys it cheap and sells it. Maybe he sells it for a commission. Either way he\\'s trying to help them scrape the last piece of dream out of their reality.He makes a profit on everything he sells. He didn\\'t go to college. He has a healthy seven figure a year business liquidating other businesses. Go Steve! There are always businesses failing. 85% of businesses fail. One quick note: if you are profitable on day one, then the odds go down to 20% that you will fail. This doesn\\'t have to be a sad time. Dreams are a rainbow. Reality is in the spectrum of colors. Then it rains and a new set of dreams come out. I spoke to Steve for almost an hour and put the conversation on my podcast. I wanted to learn more how he did his business and then I got excited and exchanged ideas how I thought he could make his business much bigger. I shouldn\\'t say \"exchange\". I gave un-asked-for advice to an already thriving business and he politely said, \"ok\". I can\\'t help myself. But this is not why I bring up Steve. I don\\'t want you to have to liquidate your business.I hope you never have to call Steve (sorry Steve). Here\\'s why I bring up Steve: Steve wrote me last night. He said, \"I\\'ve gotten some great leads from that podcast And loads of emails from people offering suggestions.\"And these aren\\'t guys trying to sell me their service. Just your listeners offering to help. You\\'ve got a very nice group of people listening to you. Thanks.\" I\\'m really proud of that. Pride kills, right? But it\\'s great to see people connect. The strength of your connections\\' connections is the true value of your network. That\\'s a combination of your skills, your beliefs, your character, your effort to reach out and help others. And your ability to step outside the boundaries set up nicely for you by everyone else. The gatekeepers, your colleagues, your bosses, sometimes family, sometimes huge industries or government. The people who laughed at your dreams. The best way to choose yourself is to build a community of other people choosing themselves. This is the only way to survive in this new economy we woke up in. Tam Pham wrote me. He said there\\'s many \"Choose Yourself Meetups\" starting up in different cities. I didn\\'t even realize how many cities. Koh Samui, Thailand?He said, \"can you promote the list of meetups?\" Because he knows that it\\'s better for him, better for everyone, if more people are reaching out to each other and helping each other choose themselves and find their own dreams and create their own realities. Tam wrote the text for me. So I\\'m going to write it here: Ever since my best-selling book, Choose Yourself, was published in 2013, it has started a movement throughout many cities.If you\\'re interested in meeting like-minded people that have used the philosophies in the book and chosen themselves in their lives, I welcome you to join these meetups groups and attend their upcoming events.1) Choose Yourself Meetup: New York, New York2) Choose Yourself Meetup: Massapequa, New York3) Choose Yourself Meetup: San Diego, California4) Choose Yourself Meetup: Bay Area, California5) Choose Yourself Meetup: Schaumburg, Illinois6) Choose Yourself Meetup: Deland, Florida7) Choose Yourself Meetup: Austin, Texas8) Choose Yourself Meetup: Houston, Texas9) Choose Yourself Meetup: Melbourne, Australia10) Choose Yourself Meetup: Manchester, United Kingdom11) Choose Yourself Meetup: London, United Kingdom12) Choose Yourself Meetup: Toronto, Canada13) Choose Yourself Meetup: Ko Sami, ThailandIf you want to start your own meetup, send an email here: info@chooseyourself.meYou can also join the Choose Yourself community on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/groups/chooseyourself.me/ where everyone shares ideas and resources with each other to improve our lives 1% each day.- - -I wrote him back and told him (or anyone starting a Choose Yourself Meetup) that I\\'ll donate books for any meetups. One business I was invested in failed about a decade ago. The CEO lied. Someone stole. The customers left. The product was probably bad. The business was liquidated.But I had nobody to call. I had no network. And the original founder blamed me. Everyone hated me. I became a shut-in because I didn\\'t want anyone to see me or talk to me. That period lasted three months before I would leave my house. Well... now I think I\\'m beautiful. \"ugly beautiful\". So now I leave my house.

       "  37: '[I did an experiment. I can\\'t wait to tell you about it. There\\'s one trick that everybody who writes sales knows and nobody else seems to know. This trick is so effective that Microsoft Word has it even built in so you can test while you write.First, I took the most popular 30 articles on LinkedIn yesterday, ranked by page views.Then I took the nine front page articles from three college newspapers: The Cornell Daily Sun, The Yale Daily News, The Daily Tarheel (Duke).For each article I calculated the most important score that every writer should keep track of.The F-K Score.The Flesch-Kincaid Score was calculated to determine at what grade level you are writing for. If your score is 10, you are writing for a 10th grade level.If your score is 12 you are writing at a 12th grade level. And so on.The F-K score is a function of how may words per sentence (lower is better). How many syllables per word (lower is better). And a few other factors.Good sales writers aim for as low a level as possible. Anything greater than 8 is considered bad sales writing. People get fired over this. But does this mean it\\'s bad writing? If you write at a 7th grade level is your writing not getting your point across in an adult manner. Maybe it\\'s too simple?I don\\'t know. You decide.One of the top ranked articles on LinkedIn yesterday was by Gretchen Rubin. She is a New York Times bestseller. She wrote \"The Happiness Project\", one of my favorite books, which has sold over a million copies. Has given TED talks. And has also been a guest on my podcast.She\\'s also my cousin. But that\\'s another story.Her article was written at a 5th grade level. She had the lowest F-K score of all 30 articles.Of the 30, I had the next lowest F-K score at 6.4.Jeff Hayden, who had the most page views by far, was writing at a 7th grade level.On average, of the 30 articles: all written by bestselling authors, CEOs, entrepreneurs, great communicators, were writing at an average of an 8th grade level.---The college students average was at a 12th grade level. The lowest score was at a 9th grade level. The highest score was a 13.4.When you want to express an idea, tell a story, share a vision, get your point across, be simple. Don\\'t use complicated words. Maybe this is BS. Maybe all these LinkedIn writers get there by writing for the lowest common denominator. Maybe it\\'s not good writing. Just sales writing.I don\\'t know. Of the 30 there were many bestselling authors.But let\\'s look at other authors who have stood the test of time.The F-K Score of \"Old Man and the Sea\" is 4. Hemingway wrote at a 4th grade level. The year after that book he won the Nobel Prize.\"Heart of Darkness\", considered one of the best books ever, by Joseph Conrad, was written at a 6th grade level.\"Crime and Punishment\" - by Dostoevsky - written at a 7th grade level.The score for this post: 4.6The skill to be an effective writer is more important than ever: texts, emails, articles, tweets, books, updates, ads, etc. Writing is how we share and communicate our lives.If you have a vision and want your ideas to be heard, as they should be, then write below an 8th grade level. Don\\'t be fancy. Don\\'t show off your semicolons. Why write something that only few will want to read?In one of the Cornell articles (with a 13.4 F-K score), here\\'s a sample sentence:What were trying to do is extrapolate positive language from currently existing policies on campus and for once tell people what they can do rather than what they cant do, Balik said. Ideally, this is something that will bring together all constituent assemblies, all the members of the community and really make Cornell a place thats easier to navigate for all.Good luck with that.Gretchen Rubin, in her article, points out that we often fail to give up habits we know in the long term are bad. Like sugar. Or too much alcohol. Or working late hours to get ahead.She says, \"We should make sure the things we do to feel better dont make us feel worse.Sounds like good advice.---About James:James Altucher is a successful entrepreneur, chess master, investor and best seller author.

       "  38: '[I lost my keys and was locked out my apartment. It was the middle of the night and I had nowhere to go. I left a message for the landlady. I tried to climb up the fire escape to see if I could sneak in but I\\'m afraid of heights. About two stories up, I froze. I couldn\\'t move up or down. I was scared.Finally I crawled down. I sat down by the curb. Did the landlady get the message? I didn\\'t know. All I could do was wait. Watch the cars go by. Smell the gas at the gas station next door. Or I could take action. Sometimes we can\\'t take action. I could\\'ve broken a window and crawled in. Like they do in TV shows. But then maybe I would bleed and it would take a long time to repair my window because I was lazy and broke. Sometimes it\\'s better to sit on the curb. And wait. And say, \"maybe she got the message\". Or say, \"I can sleep like this for now and tomorrow I can even stay with a friend if I have to.\"Sometimes you have to give up.Quitter!It\\'s not so bad to quit. Sometimes it\\'s the most productive thing you can do to quit. So many times I felt like quitting things but I kept going until it was too late. Until a cliff was reached. Until I fell off the cliff. I know so many people who try and try and try even when all hope has long since left the room. Hope doesn\\'t announce it when she leaves the room. She just leaves. I used to be in relationships where we both knew it was over a year in advance. Usually my fault. I didn\\'t trust her. And then I would get paranoid. And then she didn\\'t like my paranoia.And then I would trust her even less. And then, of course, bad things would happen. Sometimes it\\'s not so bad to quit. Sometimes you have to trust yourself that things are painful now but if you take action, things can feel a lot worse.We\\'re an action jackson culture. We want to move, to dance, to execute. \"Execution is everything!\" \"I take ACTION!\"Or, if it\\'s not working, we \"PIVOT\", we \"CHANGE!\" It\\'s hard to just sit on the curb and wait for the landlady to show up with the keys in the middle of the night. \"DO IT!\" Break the window! I had a business. When the economy went south we went from profitable to unprofitable. Then someone was caught stealing from the business.Then we lost our lease.Then we lost all our customers. Then the CEO quit. They needed more money to survive. I was going to get squeezed out of the entire business even though I had put in a lot of money.If I took action, I would\\'ve put in more money.I didn\\'t put in more money (because I was dead broke actually).The head investor called me into his office. \"We\\'re all putting in money.It looks really bad that you aren\\'t putting in money.\"I blamed my now ex-wife. \"My wife says I can\\'t invest any more. I\\'m in too many investments.\"He knew I was lying. Smart people know when you are lying. And that was a pretty pathetic lie anyway. Blaming my wife on the 50th floor of a Park Avenue building filled with professional investors.Meanwhile, the bank was foreclosing on my house. Meanwhile, I tried to get another loan from the bank with the intention of leaving the country.Good thing I never took action. Good thing I just quit.Eventually I quit everything. The investment firm fired me. My old company that I had started fired me. I lost my house. I had to store almost all of my belongings to fit into the small house I moved into.I stopped talking to all the business people I knew. We moved far away. I never left the house and I gained 30 pounds. A friend of mine called me and I told him I gained 30 pounds. He said, \"ugh, and I remember you from before.\"At what point in the rainbow does the red turn into orange.I\\'ll never figure it out. But eventually it does. Eventually it changes but you can\\'t pinpoint it. I started playing Scrabble at the local cafe. I met some good friends there. They are still my friends. I played backgammon with another friend who would come up from the city to visit me.I started to write. I wrote every day. I wrote two articles a day. I made new friends.I quit for about six months. And then I started to make some money again. And then I started to get excited about things again. Excitement creeps up. I feel it in my chest. Then my head. Then my legs want to wake up fast in the morning. I pitched a book idea. She said \"yes\". $5000 advance. YAY! Book advance!I raised money for another idea. It started to work out. I wrote down ideas every day of more things I could do. I started sending ideas to people and they would call me and ask me to help them. A year later I was getting paid more for my articles, my first book came out, I raised more money for my fund. I started another fund. I started thinking about doing another business.I was walking every day. I was writing ideas down every day. I suddenly had friends that I loved. I felt like I could be myself around them. That hadn\\'t happened to me in almost seven years.I was grateful. When it snowed I was grateful. When my kids bought me a skateboard I was grateful. When I fell and flipped over on my first ride on it, I couldn\\'t believe how happy I was when I was lying in the middle of the street and bleeding and both my daughters came running up to me screaming, \"Daddy, are you ok!?\"I quit and I quit and I quit and at the time it seemed scary. Like if I enter the abyss will I get sucked to the bottom?I had to give myself permission to quit. Many times. Not just one. But I waited and I built up from the inside. And my inside changed. And then suddenly everything on the outside changed.I quit and I waited and I surrendered.Surrendering is action. Surrendering to what you can\\'t control is the most powerful form of action. Quiet action. While waiting on the curb I saw some metal in the grass. My keys. Sometimes everything happens and you\\'ll never know the reason. But sometimes you can wait and the reason will peek out. It was hiding. It was somewhere you didn\\'t expect. But then it pops out! There you are!Here I am.---About James:James Altucher is a successful entrepreneur, chess master, investor and best seller author.

       "  39: '[My mom told me I looked disgusting. I was eating cereal. Reading a book. In a few minutes I would go to school. She had just woken up. Walked into the kitchen. Saw me. Said her thing.Not the worst thing in the world. Not something you can\\'t overcome.I was maybe 16. I liked a girl. I liked many girls. I wanted them to like me.One of my friends said, \"why don\\'t you get contacts?\"Another said, \"When are your braces coming off?\"Another said, \"You just need to smile a lot. People like people who smile.\"One time I had a cyst so big it covered the entire area from my eye, down the left side of my face, to the bottom of my nose. A big purple bubble that made my face look like a burn.Once a month my dad would take me into the city and a nurse would spend the morning draining the pus out of the cyst.Then I would spend the day at the arcades across from where my dad worked. Me and a bunch of kids from god knows where skipping school.My dad would tell me before, \"go anywhere but that arcade. It\\'s dangerous in there.\"But where else was I going to go? And it was dark. And it was fun. I was living inside a dream where the admission was free. One time I couldn\\'t comb my hair before school. The brush just wouldn\\'t go through my hair. I threw it at the mirror and told my dad I wasn\\'t going to school that day. One friend of mine said, \"just wait for college. Things get better in college.\"Ok.Ok.I\\'ll wait.I started staying home every day. I never went out at night. I didn\\'t have that many friends.My main friend I had in high school is now dead.At least, I think he\\'s dead. Since nobody can find him on Facebook and google shows up with no results.I\\'m really bad at keeping in touch with people. I wish I were better. I wish I had a group of friends that we can sit around and laugh about our mistaken memories. Together those memories can form an ugly collage. When I started college I was afraid to leave my dorm room. I was afraid what people would think when they saw me for the first time.Gradually things got better. Things change.I didn\\'t need braces anymore. Everything got a little better. I got a girlfriend although nobody could believe it.But you never lose that feeling of being someone nobody wants.The sort of person that girls whisper about. That guys come over to protect the girls. That girls run when you ask them out. I say that not because I was that \"sort of\" person but because those things happened to me.Does it get better? Yes. Yes it does. A lot better.For some people. I guess, not for everyone.When I lost all of my money (the first time) I felt the same way. Ostracized in the same way. Did it get better? Yes. Yes it did.But it doesn\\'t always. Not for everyone.If you threw me into the street and took away everything I ever had or hoped of ever having, I know I could survive because I\\'ve done it before. And then I did it before that. There\\'s one secret. The price of admission to a dream has not gone up. The cost of an illusion disappearing is still painful. Your ideas, given freely every day, are the installment plan. Build up your ideas. Share them. Help people. The secret: When you are kind to yourself, your ideas get better, you become an idea machine - it\\'s like a super power- and the installment plan gets easier. I know this because it took me a long time to be kind to myself. To be the water, the sunlight, the soil, the love, that feeds the baby flowers ready to bloom.(Photo by Diego DaSilva)]',\n",
       "  40: '[I want to be under water and float and not move.I love that feeling. Water completely surrounding me, I make every part of my body go limp. Thoughts rise up and create little thought bubbles above me on the surface.I don\\'t like to think too hard. When I float, I enjoy thinking of nothing. Outsource my thoughts to the air. To future breaths.Asking for advice is like outsourcing your thoughts. \"Asking for advice\" seems weak.But it\\'s actually the most powerful tool in your arsenal as a creative, an entrepreneur, a friend, a lover, a fighter.Advice is the world in another person\\'s eyes. What a beautiful thing to see through everyone else\\'s eyes.I was talking to Mark Ford the other day. He\\'s helped build over 100 different businesses. Maybe more. When you create wealth for so many people you lose track.We went out to dinner. Everyone kept coming over to him and hugging him and saying to me while pointing at Mark, \"this is the real deal.\"So ok.Mark told me many things. One thing he told me, struck like a clock.His partner, \"BB\", when negotiating, asks for advice at the beginning of any negotiation.Mark said, \"nothing has a specific value. Value is a range.\"So BB has a technique. He asks the person he is negotiating with, \"Give me advice since you know your business better than I do. What do you think I should pay for it.\"I thought at first. Ok, I like that. Get the other person to give a number first.But that\\'s NOT the technique at all. It has nothing to do with the number at all! That\\'s the water on the surface.BB already knows when he asks that question what his range is.When the person responds ,BB will say one of two things.\\n\"That sounds reasonable\". And then the negotiation begins about where in the range they will end up.\\n\"Oh, I couldn\\'t afford that.\" Because the person said a number way out of the range.\\nAnd I thought that meant they would negotiate further. But that was not what that answer means.It means the exact opposite of that.That answer means WE WILL NEVER TALK AGAIN. And that\\'s the entire reason for BB asking for \"advice\".\"If someone is so far out of your range in what should be the honeymoon period, then how will you be able to work with them in six months, or in five years, or in your life at all.\"Once BB says, \"Oh, I coudn\\'t afford that\" it means he\\'s identified you as a person who he would never be able to do business with ever.How many times I could\\'ve used that in relationships. Or in business. Or in friendships. Or in family. Or when simply asking for advice and gauging if a person really has my best interests at heart or is someone I should avoid forever. Why forever? There\\'s a number called \"Dunbar\\'s number\" about the number of people you can ultimately be close to in life. Someone (I guess his name is Dunbar) said, \"150\". 150 is not a big number. And if you bring someone into the fold, into your scene, someone who does not have your best interests at heart, then you\\'ve wasted a spot on that precious 150. And perhaps that one bad spot can spread like a contagion as you bring in the friends of your new friend. One bad spot in the 150 can lead to 30 bad spots. So BB asks for advice. He wants the person to tell him not a number, but whether he deserves to be in the 150. Whether he deserves to be in your scene. The people around you who will grow together and inspire and support and live and love.One by one I\\'ve been changing around my 150. \"Can I ask your advice on something?\" Once you say the word \"fu-ture\" the first syllable of the word is already long gone in the past. You can\\'t waste a syllable. You can\\'t waste the precious people close to you. Once you do a deal, seal a love, make a friendship, the first smile and handshake is long gone. For only a short while you can float without thinking. Then you have to move. Then your body forces you to come up for air. Until the day it doesn\\'t. What a great thing if everyone left in your wake at that point gave you good advice along the way.- - -About James:James Altucher is a successful entrepreneur, chess master, investor and best seller author.

       "  41: '[Choosing yourself means taking risk, means not being afraid what people think, or your chances of success or failure. It means doing what you want and hopefully helping the world along the way. Because when you help others, that\\'s how you get paid in a choose yourself world. Elon Musk is inspirational to many people, including me. Inspiration is somewhat of a risk: it takes you outside the world you once knew and introduces you to a new thought, person, idea, or something totally unexpected. I want to find Elon Musk\\'s most inspirational quotes. The ones that might give clues to how each inspiration leads to the next. The ticking of the clock.Here\\'s his quotes that most stuck with me. 1. If something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it.I often get stuck: what if something really is impossible?But Elon Musk then takes it to the next level always: \"let\\'s go to Mars\". Or \"let\\'s make a billion dollar battery factory.\" So at the very least it\\'s always worth exploring the delicious curvature of the impossible. 2. Going from PayPal, I thought: Well, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? Not from the perspective, Whats the best way to make money?I\\'ve interviewed over 100 people now on my podcast. Each of the 100 have achieved amazing results in their life. That\\'s a subjective opinion.\"Amazing\" to me. But none of them have done if for the money. I was talking to Coolio, for instance, who had the best selling song of 1995. He started writing lyrics every day in 1977. It took him 17 years to have a single hit. \"Never do something for the money,\" Coolio told me. \"Or the girls\", he added. 3. (Physics is) a good framework for thinking.  Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there.My guess is he is not referring specifically to the science and theories of physics but the act of visualizing something, coming up with an idea or a theory of why it might be true, and then figuring out how to prove that theory. To me, thats what physics is. Since the rules are constantly changing, which is another fascinating aspect of physics. Visualize a possible universe. Prove that it can happen. 4. The first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur.I wonder about this. What\\'s impossible? Maybe a time machine is too hard to figure out. But to make an electric car you can imagine first a hybrid car that has a trunk filled with very efficient batteries so you don\\'t ever need the gas part. Then it becomes a function of probabilities versus possibilities. 5. Its OK to have your eggs in one basket as long as you control what happens to that basket.Many people think entrepreneurship is about risk. In fact, it\\'s the opposite. Good entrepreneurs don\\'t learn by failure (the popular \"failure porn\" all over the Internet). Good entrepreneurs learn by solving difficult problems. Elon Musk controlled his outcome with X.com not by destroying the competitor but by merging with it (paypal). 6. Persistence is very important. You should not give up unless you are forced to give up.I always think this is the magic equation: persistence + love = abundance. You have to love something enough to persist. You have to persist enough to deepen your love. This is true for a career. True for a relationship. But only true for YOU and not what someone tells you to do. And then abundance is the natural outcome. Not just for you but for everyone. Since wealth comes to those who create wealth for others. 7. You want to have a future where youre expecting things to be better, not one where youre expecting things to be worse.This is incredibly important. News reporters have zero qualifications to inform people and yet they are all doom and gloom to sell subscriptions. But people who choose themselves... first imagine a better world and how to make the leap to get there. 8. It is a mistake to hire huge numbers of people to get a complicated job done. Numbers will never compensate for talent in getting the right answer (two people who dont know something are no better than one), will tend to slow down progress, and will make the task incredibly expensive.When I was running a software company, we always knew it would take one great programmer to solve a hard problem in one night versus 10 mediocre programmers taking a month to screw up a problem even worse. Ultimately, if you want to make a TV show, don\\'t rely on the gatekeepers. Take a camera. Make a youtube video. Make 100 youtube videos. Now you have a show. All by yourself. 9. If you go back a few hundred years, what we take for granted today would seem like magic  being able to talk to people over long distances, to transmit images, flying, accessing vast amounts of data like an oracle. These are all things that would have been considered magic a few hundred years ago.And now imagine what it will be like 300 years from now when people look back at today. \"They had to actually \\'connect\\' to an Internet then!\" or \"It took them 7 hours to get from NY to CA!\" 10. My biggest mistake is probably weighing too much on someones talent and not someones personality. I think it matters whether someone has a good heart.I recently watched a company go from a billion in revenues to zero when a founder stole $90 million from the company. Integrity, humility, and doing your best is by far the most important consideration when evaluating whether to work for someone. In order to choose yourself, you have to make sure you have completely surrounded yourself with others willing to take the same leaps. Else you will all fall into the ravine you are leaping over. 11. When I was in college, I wanted to be involved in things that would change the world. Now I am.I always wonder about the phrase \"change the world\". Can one person change another. Perhaps the most valuable starting point is to do everything I can to change myself each day: to be physically healthier, to be around emotionally healthy people ,to be create, to be grateful. To try and improve in these areas 1% a day. Then maybe I can have a head start on changing the world. 12. I think its very important to have a feedback loop, where youre constantly thinking about what youve done and how you could be doing it better. I think thats the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.I\\'m invested in about 30 companies. The companies that fail are when CEOs smoke their own crack. Technology, competition, customers are constantly changing. But we have a cognitive bias to think that the activity we have invested the most time in is, of course, a GREAT activity. What could be wrong with it? So it\\'s important to constantly question this evolution-based cognitive bias with constant questioning as if one were an outsider looking in. Without that, businesses fail. And if you have trouble taking your own feedback, find someone you trust. Find an accountability partner. Ask: am I choosing myself? And when you find one...find a group. Have a meetup of like-minded people. Together, is how we individually choose ourselves.13. I wouldnt say I have a lack of fear. In fact, Id like my fear emotion to be less because its very distracting and fries my nervous system.A small level of fear is motivational. It forces me to have a backup plan. The average multimillionaire supposedly has seven sources of income. They all have backup plans. Even Elon Musk has Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity, and probably a dozen other companies he\\'s peripherally involved in. Any endeavor I do, I always ask two questions: \"What is my plan B?\" and \"What is my evil plan?\" Meaning what do I hope to learn from this that nobody else expects.14. Life is too short for long-term grudges.I always think that I\\'m the average of the five people I spend the most time with. So this quote is important to me. Don\\'t spend time with people who can even incite a grudge. I try to spend time with the people I love and who love me.Even when something bad happens, rather than blame, I try to think about what I learned. I don\\'t want to make the same mistake again. It takes practice. I am very trusting. But I hope to learn a little each day.15. Dont be afraid of new arenas.Again, inspiration is a risk. It means stepping out of the comfort zone where you\\'ve never been before. I try as an exercise to figure out at least one thing a day to do that is outside my comfort zone. The other day I went up to people and asked them if I could buy a $1 bill with a $2 bill. Interestingly, everybody who was white avoided me. I was a lunatic. But everyone else took my $2 bill in exchange for a $1 bill.You never know what you find when you experiment. But it\\'s always fun and scary and good practice for getting out of the comfort zone.16. I think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.I thought about this when I read it. I think it\\'s ok for \"ordinary\" people to be ordinary also. Ordinary is beautiful. But I think every day it\\'s worth trying to be a little better (1%, an amount so small it can\\'t be measured) in physical health, emotional health, creativity, and gratitude. Maybe that is a path to extraordinary as that 1% compounds. But I don\\'t want the pressure of \"future extraordinary\". I just want to be a little better today17. I could either watch it happen or be a part of it.Sometimes people say to me, \"I missed the boat\" or \"I am too late\". I think it\\'s never too late to do what you love.What you love is always on the shore, waiting for you to arrive, waiting with open arms.18. Being an Entrepreneur is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of deathPeople say to me, \"I hate my cubicle. I want to be an entrepreneur.\" Entrepreneurship is a disaster. 85% of entrepreneurs fail and failure is not fun at all. Not to mention you have to deal with customers, employees, investors - they are all your bosses and not the other way around. Then you have to sell, you have to execute, you have to build, you have to exit, you have to grow. I like Elon Musks\\'s approach of having many things to work on. Many Plan Bs. So any one entrepreneurial endeavor doesn\\'t take up all the mind space.One secret, though, to beat that 85%. If you start off with a profitably customer, the odds of failure go from 85% to less than 20%. 19. \"I would like to die on Mars. Just not on impact.\"I highly recomend Andy Weir\\'s book, \"The Martian\". He self-published it. Then it got picked up by a major publisher. Now Ridley Scott doing the movie. Discusses this very topic.20. On his favorite book when he was a teen, \"The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy\": It taught me that the tough thing is figuring out what questions to ask, but that once you do that, the rest is really easy.\"Here\\'s my favorite part of Hitchher\\'s Guide to the Galaxy: the idea that all you really need from a materialistic perspective is a towel. Then the Universe sort of takes care of things after that. Hygiene is key.21. \"I just want to retire before I go senile because if I don\\'t retire before I go senile, then I\\'ll do more damage than good at that point.\"The two most critical years in terms of dying are the year you are born and the year you retire. So I doubt Elon Musk will ever retire.---Choosing yourself is not about launching a rocket to Mars. Or making a billion. Or even creating peace in the world. It\\'s about not letting anyone tell you you can\\'t. It\\'s about maneuvering around \"can\\'t\", no matter what the risk. It\\'s about having a backup plan. It\\'s about health, to prepare you for the war against skeptics. It\\'s scary and exhilarating, and requires you to take action, and requires you to persist. But it\\'s worth it. Because nobody knows better than you what will set your life on fire and what will lift it into space and beyond.---About James:James Altucher is a successful entrepreneur, chess master, investor and best seller author.

       "  42: '[I asked Claudia if she would still love me in 40 years. I don\\'t know why I asked. Maybe because she was making me coffee. If every morning someone asks you to make coffee, how can you love him?Maybe she would get tired of it. To be blunt: I would not like making her coffee every day for 40 years. She turned to me and there was the pause that comes between two lines of poetry. I just looked it up. There\\'s a word for that pause. A caesura. Claudia spoke first a silent caesura. A search for the right words so everything can click. I should speak with more caesuras. \"I don\\'t know,\" she said. \"40 years is forever.\" And it\\'s true. I look back at the last five years of my life. Even the last year of my life. Even yesterday. Who could\\'ve predicted? Questions are clothes with no bodies inside of them. Tomorrow is just a question. When I got puked out of the education system and stood on a corner of New York City near Chinatown I was waiting for the traffic light to turn. green This was 21 years ago.And so many people were coming at me. Beautiful people. Interesting people. All people I wanted to talk to and to touch.I was love sick for everyone who passed. Talk to me! And then I remembered being a kid and my parents loved me and suddenly I felt home sick. I feel home sick right now writing this. Imagine for a second being home sick. Where do you feel it in the body?I feel it a little in my stomach and chest and my eyes. Not a bad feeling. A homesick feeling. And then, right when I first moved to NYC, I remembered my girlfriend, 1000 miles away, and I felt sick for her. Why did I leave so fast? And I felt sick for everyone before her because I never thought of them anymore. Yet they were people who I had once confessed love to. And years later, after I had lost the last dollar that would pay my next month\\'s expenses, I felt money-sick. A deep pit of hopelessness. The bottomless nothing.And I felt bad for my two babies that I had to support. And I felt bad for myself that I had gotten lucky and now the luck had run out. I feel bad now that at one point I thought it was luck and now I know it was only part luck. Part disease. Part skill. Part chemistry equation. This is the equation. This is the entire post: Persistence + Love + Health = Abundance. No professor ever wrote that on the board for me. How come?Every morning, before my first job, I would sit at train station at 5am with all the other sleepy people.I\\'m sorry now we all waited together and yet nobody spoke. The sun would soon overwhelm us, a lover for the day.People say to me, \"My life can really begin once I find my passion.\" Maybe so. Maybe so. But passion often comes long after persistence explores every part of the maze. Creativity and gratitude and helping others, step by step, is what gets us through the maze. Those are the only things today that moves me one step forward in the maze. Standing on that corner in NYC 21 years ago. I had no passion. I was afraid to speak or to touch.I was lonely and hungry and nothing and I couldn\\'t cross the street. I couldn\\'t move at all. And I loved the sea of people moving around me, getting to their expectations as quickly as possible, and I was sick with all the possibility, and happy to be free of not wanting any one thing specific. I was in the desert and I had no water to give it. Nothing was predictable. I\\'m glad now nothing was predictable. And nothing has changed.

       "  43: '[Louis CK turned down $500,000 a year from Conan in the early 90s so he could go broke instead. Conan wanted to hire him as head writer of his show.Every step of the way in the 20 years since he put a challenge in front of himself that seemed impossibleand it was until he passed it. Now he\\'s the best comedian ever. One can argue with that but one can argue about anything. He was offered the job of head writer at one of the hottest comedy shows in the world. He would\\'ve grown from that and be set for life. Instead he decided to hit the road. He went from gas station to comedy club to bowling alley to hotel to wherever to tell his hour of jokes. He talks in one interview about he loved to perform at proms. \"I would get booed by drunk teenagers even before I got on stage. If you can handle that you can handle anything.\" He was already one of the best comedians in the world already in 1997 when I first saw him perform. But that wasn\\'t the end of it. In the mid 00s he made a radical transformation to his act. Inspired by one of his heroes / mentors, George Carlin, he did two things: 1. CONSTANT CHANGE.He changed his act every year - \"January 1 I had no material.\" He would start from scratch. This is incredibly difficult to do. To be honest, I don\\'t quite know how to do that with my writing although I try. 2. AUTHENTICITY. He decided to leave behind the classic jokes of comedians (\"what\\'s my ethnic background? Here\\'s how I make fun of it. Etc\") and talk more about his personal life. In 2010 I played some of Louis CK\\'s jokes to my kids. His jokes were then about how his kids basically suck. My children were horrified. \"Isn\\'t he being mean? What do his kids think?\" But it was funny. They laughed. And Louis CK doesn\\'t tell those jokes anymore. Every year they get better. But that\\'s not all Louis CK did after he turned down the job for Conan. 3. MASTER EVERY ASPECT.He also wrote a movie. It was crazy stupid wild. \"Pootie Tang\". It\\'s a cult favorite. And everyone hates it. Watch it. It is completely insane. He directed, produced, and wrote it, getting experience from two different sides of the camera.He also made an HBO show that got cancelled (starring not only Louis but also my prior podcast guest, Jim Norton). The HBO show was a direct insult to the then current form of TV production. He also pitched a show to CBS, they rejected it. And he pitched a show to FX (they barely accepted it, giving him the lowest possible budget per show ever and he turned that into one of the most successful series on TV). Before that he wrote on the Chris Rock show, getting experience in other forms of comedy. 4. UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESS SIDE. I can keep going. Louis CK released on his website his comedy special even though any major network would\\'ve been happy to pay him for it. He made over 7 figures in a day. Constantly experimenting: he worked on his art (listen to the way he does voices now versus 10 years ago, 20 years ago).He worked on his authenticity. He challenged himself in ways that seemed impossible (coming up with an hour of material every year, it took Jerry Seinfeld 15 years to do that). He wrote, he was a director, he was a producer, he created a TV show, he wrote for TV shows, he handled rejection, he created an ecommerce site, and he constantly expanded his rolodex and network. He didn\\'t put in 10,000 hours. He put in 20,000 hours. 5. UNDERSTAND ALL THE SUBTLETIES. Jonah Hill tells a story when he was on Howard Stern. Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen were in the movie \"Funny People\" playing standup comedians. So they wanted to get experience as comedians. They did an open mic night at a local club. The Jonah Hill segment is on YouTube and is pretty funny. But by coincidence, Louis CK was also performing there that night. So Seth and Jonah were terrified. After the show Louis CK comes up to them. Jonah Hill was an academy award nominee and one of the funniest actors on the planet. Seth Rogen is a mega-comedy superstar in every movie (yes, even in the Green Hornet). Louis CK said, \"what, are you guys playing comedians or something and practicing for the role?\" Seth and Jonah said yes. Louis CK said, \"Ok.\" He turned to Seth Rogen. \"You did ok.\"He turned to Jonah Hill and said, \"You need a lot of work.\" Jonah Hill had never done stand up before. Seth Rogen had done some standup as a kid ( a clip of Rogen doing standup as a 13 year old is on YouTube). Louis CK saw every subtlety. We\\'re all born with a limited set of resources. Energy, intelligence, time, money. Louis CK could\\'ve taken that $500,000 a year job and kept improving from that point. 6. DELIBERATELY PUTTING CHALLENGES IN FRONT OF YOURSELF. But 10,000 hours of work isn\\'t about improving. It\\'s about starting from a place of hunger, and going above and beyond the ceilings placed above you, and achieving mastery.It\\'s about taking all the resources you have and investing completely in yourself so that you constantly have nothing to fall back on except your own ingenuity and success. It\\'s about taking everything you have, emptying your \"life bank account\" and pouring it back into yourself. Looking for the \"return on YOU\" instead of the \"return on investment\". Louis kept starting from scratch and challenging himself to force himself to master some aspect of comedy he had never mastered before. To start from scratch:\\nat a job. Giving up $500,000 a year to have no job security forced him to up his skills enough to get paid on the road versus every other comic in the world.\\nat writing a movie\\nat writing comedy fresh every year\\nat being authentic and honest and not falling on the comedy standard used by other comedians\\n7. BREAKING BOUNDARIES\\nat starring in a TV show that broke boundaries (\"Lucky Louie\" took 70s style TV direction and brought it, unsuccessfully, into the 21st century).\\nat writing, producing, directing, starring in a new TV show with almost no budget.\\nat constantly hitting that gray area where he both insults the audience and gets the audience to love him (\"can all the Jews leave now?\" - Louis CK is part Jewish, part Mexican, part Boston, part other things).\\nbecause we are in an arena where the gatekeepers are dying, Louis CK made his own website the source of distribution when nobody in comedy had ever done that.\\nStudy his comedy in the 80s, the mid 00s, now. See how he improves. How he constantly invested in himself. Do the same with another master: Jerry Seinfeld, and compare the different ways they improved. Louis CK has defined a new level of mastery in comedy.\\n8. FAILING\\nat failure. How many things has Louis Ck failed at? Writing a movie, two TV shows, probably numerous comedy events.\\nHe was already one of the greats but why did CBS reject him and FX barely accept him? How did he overcome this frustration when he was divorced, getting into his 40s, and having no prospects for success (he\\'s a high school dropout - this was IT for him). He must have been scared? He must have had some despair on his chances. And then he did it. 9. BUILDING YOUR SCENE YOU ACHIEVE MASTERY WITH. In the show \"Louie\", which is semi-autobiographical, the main character (played by Louis CK) is watching a TV clip from the 80s and sees himself performing and Sarah Silverman performing. He calls Sarah Silverman on the phone and they watch it together and are nostalgic for those years when they were so young and just starting out. 10. STUDYING THE HISTORY. Comedy isn\\'t about telling jokes. It\\'s about observation. And studying the observation of all the observers before you. From that moment on in the 80s, he invested in himself. He studied the history. He studied every comedian. He studied failure. He studied every aspect of the art. His \"return on himself\" was one million percent. Not everyone needs to do that to feel a sense of success. I don\\'t think I\\'ve done it. But it\\'s beautiful to watch and appreciate it. Louis CK is not my favorite because of a single joke or two. He\\'s my favorite because he invested in himself and not the opinions of others. He invested in himself and not the gatekeepers. I want to be like him when I grow up.(Photo by Dan Nguyen)]',\n",
       "  44: '[The woman had tattoos etched beautifully over her arms and told me the story of each one. Her husband owned the rights to 14,000 songs and told me the 20 year roller coaster ride of how he had acquired them. He owned the rights to almost all my favorite songs. I learned an immense amount listening to the two of them. Then I left even though the party kept going. I left early.When I sold my first business, it was because my sister in high school was learning how to do exactly what I did for my clients. I was charging $75,000 to do a 3 page website and now 13 year olds were doing it better and for free. Time to leave the party. It takes a half hour for the stomach to communicate to the brain whether or not it\\'s full. Here\\'s the solution: buy smaller plates. \"You\\'ll eat 20-30% less calories\" says a future guest on my podcast. Someone on a post the other day said I should be ashamed for encouraging people to be \"not informed\". He\\'s probably never been inside a real newsroom to see who is doing the informing. I leave the news early. I leave parties earlier. If I meet you in the street and say hello and fall in love with you, I\\'ll probably leave early. I try to go to sleep early. I try to wake up early. If I do yoga I don\\'t kill myself doing it. I\\'ll do what I can and then leave early. If I\\'m in a meeting, 15 minutes is my deadline. Then I leave early. I\\'ll just hang up and 90% of the time nobody on the conference call knows I\\'m gone. \"I prefer to leave early\" is my mantra. \"Prefer\" is there because why pressure myself into a \"Must\"?Then there\\'s the usual math. 15 minutes of \"leaving early\" every day adds up to about 3-4 years of extra love or work or art you can express per decade (assuming people work or fun or or create or love for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week). That\\'s 3-4 years worth of quality time you can spend with people you love. 3-4 years worth of art you can create. I don\\'t care what the \"art\" is. Make six second videos. Draw a picture of a house every day. Write a dumb poem. The dumbest poem possible. Here is an example of the worst poem ever: ---I prefer to leave earlyThat\\'s why I\\'m never surlyAnd my hair stays curlyAnd even when I\\'m latePlease excuse meBecause I\\'ll still leave early---I\\'ve spent much time in the past ten years coming up with many multiple streams of income for myself. I usually write about my failures. Because they are more fun stories. But maybe one sentence of success. I have about 15 different sources of income. Each one was difficult. I had to master each area. And then move on, else I\\'d be stuck with just one source instead of 15. I had to leave the party early on each one. I\\'m afraid to work for a boss. I\\'m always afraid I\\'ll be trapped in a prison and have to do things I don\\'t want to do. A boss is when you have one source. One person who can change your life with two words, \"You\\'re fired\". I need to feed many mouthes. I feed the IRS. I feed my family. I feed my stress so I don\\'t go crazy again in the back of a police car.Every stream of income requires a little bit of love and tenderness per week. Then...per month. Then...per year. Now I have time to write stupid poetry. Next time you go to a party. Maybe even it\\'s a political party. Or a charity event. Or a dinner. Or a conference call. Or a sales meeting. Do this:Find the most valuable, fun, creative thing you can learn as quickly as you can. The one thing that will add value to your life. Hone in on it FAST. Learn something.Then leave. Even in a sales meeting: if you learn from the customer, the customer will buy from you. Even on a first date. Get the kiss. Leave early. It gets better later if you leave early today.Someone said to the great pianist, Artur Rubinsteain, \"I love the way you play the notes!\" Artur Rubinstein said, \"Ahh, the secret is how I play the silences between the notes.\" The real you is the silences between the notes. Not the you in the meetings. The talking you. The worrying you. The you trying to please the date or the boss or the trolls. The you that HAS to respond! I try (sometimes not so successfully. Sometimes horribly) to play the silences in between the notes. How many things can you leave early today? Be honest about it. This is the only gift we were given when we were born. The ability to leave things early.Without the silence, we would never know how to distinguish a beautiful sound.(Photo by John St John)]',\n",
       "  45: '[I\\'ve given up right before the finish line. It\\'s not as bad as people say really. It even has a nice ring to it. French. \"I\\'m a self-saboteur\". Maybe I\\'m a spy. Like, right when you are about to make a lot of money, or finish a book, or get a job, or whatever, you can\\'t take it anymore and you just give up. It\\'s too much. Take drugs or have a lot of sex instead. Enjoy. Who am I to judge?For one thing, once you give up you take off all the pressure of being a \"winner\". Who cares anyway? I once wrote the software for a company that I was going to split 50-50 with a guy. This was 20 years ago. I wrote the software. Well, I wrote almost all the software. I gave up. Too much work. I wanted to play with girls. Now it\\'s a thriving business. It\\'s a fun consumer-oriented website. I\\'m a free member for life. He\\'s made millions. Ok, that happens. I am happy for him. When it comes to self-sabotage I\\'m an expert. If anyone needs advice on how to self-sabotage themselves I am here for you. I can even open up a clinic maybe. I\\'ll wear my labcoat. People will come in and say: I\\'m about to sell my company, or my book looks like it\\'s going to be a bestseller. I\\'ll say, Whoah! Hold on there cowboy. Let\\'s take a step back. And then let\\'s take TWO steps back. Just sit back down hombre. Space is for astronauts, you know what I mean? There are so many great things about self-sabotage, depending on who you are. More cheap and fun relationships? Or maybe just lying in bed and reading more books. I don\\'t know. You and I, we\\'ll figure it out together. Here\\'s the most common kinds of self-sabotage I\\'ve either seen or I\\'ve done myself. You are welcome to all of them. I\\'ve even been addicted to self-sabotage. And I\\'ve had the best enablers. I\\'ll admit I hope I\\'m over it now. But once an addict, always an addict. I see them everywhere, every day. Not a day goes by I don\\'t see it among even my closest friends. A) CONTROLLet\\'s say you have a great idea. An idea that will change the world. It\\'s brilliant. You can make a billion. Maybe ten billion. But not everyone is good at everything. I\\'m not good at filling out my taxes, for instance. Thank you Richard M. Gabor for helping me with that. I\\'m not good at driving. Thank you Miss Claudia Azula Altucher for helping me with that. I\\'m not the best businessman. But I have many many mentors who help me with that. Thank you. Always say Thank You is what my mamma taught me. When you have one piece of a puzzle but someone has another piece of the puzzle, then you have to let them help you.But they want 95%!? I called Chet the day after the Netscape IPO in 1995. I said to him, can you believe this BS?He said, what are you talking about? Marc Andreesen, who wrote the software, only ended up with like 5% of the company. Jim Clark and James Barksdale got a lot of the rest. J-j-j-James, hold up there, Chet said. Without those guys this software would never have left the lab. And now he\\'s rich anyway. Great ideas happen to individuals. But great executions happen in groups. Another BRILLIANT example is with PayPal. Peter Thiel (Paypal.com) and Elon Musk (X.com) were going head to head and destroying each other through competition. How did they solve the problem? They merged. When PayPal finally sold to Ebay for $1.5 billion, Peter Thiel, the FOUNDER of PayPal had just 3% of that. Did he care? Of course not. He took 1% of what he made and invested it in a tiny website called Facebook. B) LEAKSI was once at a poker table in Las Vegas during my \"year of poker\". I played poker for 365 days straight, every day, every night, including the night my first daughter was born. I\\'m not proud of it but if I worried about every way someone could judge me from 16 years ago I\\'d be a scared man all the time. One guy at the table, maybe the best player there, said to me, \"I have one leak. Women.\" In other words, he makes his money, and then he spends it all on prostitutes instead of saving up his bankroll and really making a play for the big leagues of poker. Be honest. What are your leaks?. Maybe you fall for too many people. This is an addiction also. I am too trusting. I often have to rely on others to help me figure out who to trust. Maybe you drink too much. Or read junk news too much. Maybe you think the finish line was earlier than it really was. This happens to me a lot. I think, \"Ok! I\\'m married. I don\\'t have to focus on this relationship any more!\" Often it\\'s in those final 10 yards in a 26 mile marathon that the race for gold really begins. But most people don\\'t know that. I learn that over and over because I\\'m an addict. Every day I have to remind myself. C) BLAME SOMEONE ELSE (EXCUSES)This is the worst. It\\'s nice and easy when something goes wrong to blame someone else. Why would one blame others? It\\'s nice when things are not your fault. That\\'s one reason. Another reason is jealousy. If the rich are oppressing the poor, then they are easy targets to blame and could explain why one is not rich. \"I would never want to do what they have to do!\" \"MMmph!\" (Stamps foot down!)Or maybe everything would\\'ve worked out but you made a poor decision when you hired that guy. That ONE guy that screwed it all up! \"He seemed like a good choice. How could I know??\" There\\'s a two-step solution to blame: a. It\\'s your fault. It\\'s always your fault. b. Have a Plan B on every decision. If you follow \"a\" you\\'ll never waste time being angry with someone else. They have their own issues. Now they need you to be angry at them?If you follow \"b\" then whatever bad happens, you have a backup plan. It\\'s not always easy to have a backup plan. That\\'s why very few people win the gold medal. D) BLAME DOOM &amp; GLOOM\"It was the housing bust!\" That cost me my house. Then my family. Then my job. Then I couldn\\'t get a new job. Then I got depressed. Then I had to take medication. Then and then and then! BLAH! Every day there\\'s bad news. I\\'ve worked for enough newspapers to know that the news is bad for a reason. It\\'s not like there\\'s only bad news happening. But they only REPORT bad news. Picture you\\'re in the jungle. To your left is a donut tree (I love donut trees) and to your right is a lion. Which one makes your brain light up more and pay attention. The newspaper industry knows that you will pick up a paper that has a lion on it that is about to eat you. If you\\'re American then you certainly aren\\'t hungry so the donut tree can wait. \"It\\'s Obamacare!\" \"It\\'s the government bailouts!\" \"It\\'s Greece!\" I like the last one. Everytime Greece is in the news every stock investor I know loses money because \"It\\'s Greece!\" and then you turn on TV and people even uglier than me are talking about Greece like it\\'s a Hiroshima on the economy. Then they forget about it for awhile (\"it\\'s Ebola!\") and then it\\'s back in the news again. Solution: Macroeconomics is largely a myth. It\\'s just an extra thing to study in college so they can justify charging you $40,000 a semester. Even politics is a myth, particularly in the West. How much has a President really moved the needle on your life. If you\\'re in the army (i.e. you work for the President) then they might move the needle. But largely the President, the Congress, some judges, etc maybe move the needle 5-10% on your life only once in awhile. So ignore it all. People say, \"but don\\'t you need to be informed?\" About what? I can\\'t really think of anything I\\'ve ever been informed about that has significantly changed my life. I like to focus on the things I love, not the things I\\'m informed about that disappear tomorrow. E) ENTITLEMENTI am happy to say I have never fallen for this. Only because I\\'ve seen others fall for it a lot. So when I see it happening in me, I shut up. \"I\\'m better than this! I deserve to make $X\". And that ruins everything. All visions, all bigger pictures. It ruins it for everyone who backed you and supported you in the past. It ruins it for your boss, who now has to fire you. Entitlement is the same as the word \"ceiling\". Once you feel entitled to X, then X is your ceiling. Nobody is entitled to anything. A great example is Louis CK. The man is the greatest comedian alive (you have to admit top 10 even if you disagree with me). He was offered to be the head writer for Conan in the early 90s at $500,000 a year but he turned it down. How come? He wanted to be a comedian. He went on the road. He shot a movie. He kept pitching his own shows. He kept improving his skills. Not over a period of months but over a decades. In the mid 00s he even had a show on HBO, \"Lucky Louie\" (also starring a recent podcast guest, Jim Norton). It got cancelled. Then he pitched another show to CBS. They rejected it. Finally he pitched a show to FX. He didn\\'t give up like, \"they NEED to give me a show. I\\'m the best!\" Now it\\'s one of the best shows ever on television. And he\\'s my hero. If at any point he had given up because of feelings of entitlement he never would have created the work of art he now does and gone on to higher heights as a comedian. Oh man, long post again. What the heck? Can\\'t I just make a list like everyone else does and keep these down to 300 words or less? I forget who said it: \"I\\'m writing a long letter to you because I didn\\'t have the time to write a short letter\". So ok, I will just list the other ways people self-sabotage. F) COMPLAININGG) GOSSIPINGH) FEAR OF CONFRONTATIONI) THE WORD \"CAN\\'T\" Ok, I need to comment on this one. If someone says to you, go be the best pianist in the world, you might say, \"i can\\'t do that\". That\\'s fine. That\\'s a normal \"Can\\'t\". I\\'m not a big believe in \"Can\\'t Porn\" - this idea that you should NEVER say \"Can\\'t\". But so many people take something simple: like \"self-publish a book ever month or so and make an extra $1000 a month\" and say \"I can\\'t\". Why can\\'t you? Did you try the 20 times that are necessary to get good at something? Did you study all the books on self-publishing and the techniques of the people who did? Do you have to be 8 feet tall to self-publish? Can you stop watching TV for one hour a day so you can do your full time job and write your book on the side and at least try? It\\'s your heart\\'s desire but you\\'re so afraid of failure that you don\\'t even want to make the attempt so you can continue to live with the illusion, \"I could do it ...if only I can\\'t do it.\" ??Roosevelt could\\'ve said, \"I can\\'t. I have polio.\" Hawking could\\'ve said, \"I can\\'t. I can\\'t even move!\" Thomas Edison said, \"I can\\'t. It didn\\'t work the first 999 times. It will never work.\" \"Can\\'t\" is the jealous lover of \"Persistence\". J) NOT MY THINGWe get labels early on. I\\'m a mathematician not a businessman. I\\'m a dancer not an actress. I\\'m a programmer, not a salesman. I\\'m a pretty girl, not a physicist.Richard Branson could\\'ve said, \"I\\'m a music guy not an airline guy.\" Elon Musk could\\'ve said, \"I help people on Ebay buy baseball cards, I can\\'t blast a rocketship into space.\" Steve Jobs could\\'ve said, \"I\\'m a computer guy not a music/phone/movie guy.\" JK Rowling could\\'ve said, \"I have to take care of my kid. Not write a fantasy novel with unknown prospects.\" Maybe these are just anecdotes. Benjamin Franklin could\\'ve said, \"I run a printing press. I don\\'t know anything about lightening.\" Albert Einstein could\\'ve said, \"I\\'m a clerk in an office. I don\\'t know anything about the time-space continuum\".---I feel like there are some that I\\'m missing. Please add to the list. We all see self-sabotage every day. I know it. OH! Here\\'s one. K) NEVER THE RIGHT CONDITIONSLike the guy who has to be in Paris to write. Or the woman who has to be Silicon Valley to start a tech company. Or you have to be in Hollywood to be an actress. Or you\\'re \"stuck\" and don\\'t know how to get out. That\\'s a post in itself. What are others?I see self-sabotage every day. People who don\\'t know how to sell an idea, or express a vision, or who want to fail because that gives them something to blame. So they give up. What am I missing?I will tell you this, though. If you run those last ten yards.... If you just make the attempt. If you just cross the finish line...There\\'s the other side of the finish line. And you realize you never have to stop running. Nobody is ever going to stop you now. (oh, they will try. But they will fail). You can run out of the stadium. Past the people. Past the houses. Past the forest. You run and now you jump and now you\\'re in the air. You\\'re flying.(Photo by 55Laney69)]',\n",
       "  46: '[Here\\'s the Rule: born, school for 12 years, college, grad school, job, sowing oats, marriage, kids, promotions, luxuries, retirement, death. Here\\'s the Fact: the Rule never happens. Here\\'s the Sadder fact: People who believe in the Rule will get depressed and disappointed. Even at a young age: \"it\\'s too late for me!!\" Which is to say: there\\'s an exception. Which is to say: the exception is to be exceptional. I don\\'t know how you can be exceptional. I\\'m the last person to give advice. I\\'m the guy who last week was an unlicensed driver crashing on an icy road into a snow bank with my 12 year old next to me. I\\'m the other guy who has failed in 17 out of 20 businesses. I\\'m divorced. My mother doesn\\'t speak to me. But here\\'s what I try to do. And I guess it\\'s better for me than not doing it. OVER PROMISE AND OVER DELIVEREveryone says \"under-promise\". Don\\'t do that. Don\\'t be that guy. The obvious liar. It\\'s so obvious when people under-promise. In a group of ten people, nine will under-promise. Be the person who steps forward instead of backward. When I sold stockpickr.com to thestreet.com I had very ambitious goals for traffic. They didn\\'t think I would meet it but they would be happy if I did. So I created a Q&amp;A portion of the site that many people got obsessed with. Traffic doubled within a month. I over-delivered and they were able to put ads on every page. Not that I was so great. I got depressed about six months later and stopped showing up. Don\\'t tell them but someone else wrote all my articles (2007). I never was good at working for someone. But at least the product I sold them kept humming and still is.  HAVE A VISIONIt was 1994 when I was at HBO and nobody had a website.Whenever I tried to convince people to go on the \"world wide web\" my boss\\'s boss\\'s boss would tell my boss, \"please get him off this internet stuff. The internet is good for academics but not cable guys.\" Christmas weekend I took all of their databases (including the kitchen menu) and made an intranet and then put Netscape on every desk. Then within a year I was running their website. Then a year after that I had a company on the side creating websites for other businesses. I was a very bad businessman. I should have stayed unprofitable, raised money, gone public, cashed out. But instead I made websites as cheaply as possible for all of our clients. When you have a vision it makes you bigger than your job, it makes you bigger than the company you start, it makes you bigger than the people who buy your company. The way to get a vision is to read as much as possible, and then dig inside and see what excites you. Write down ten ideas every day. Buried inside those ideas is your vision. Self-publishing excites me, for instance, right now. And batteries. I wish my phone battery would last forever. Oh, and I have a vision that I\\'m the best comedian ever. I doubt that will happen. But hey, I have to try. HONESTYI don\\'t believe in radical honesty - where there is no filter between your head and your mouth. Don\\'t tell your wife\\'s friend\\'s sister you want to have sex with her for instance. The Bible starts: \"In the beginning was the Word\". That\\'s all we have that defines us to other people. Our words and our actions. Do we do what we say we are going to do. Or do we slander? Do we gossip? Do we try to play politics. Be the source. When you go to Google, Google is honest: \"I don\\'t know anything about motorcycles but I\\'ve done a lot of work and I think these ten websites can help you. And, by the way, three of these websites are paying me to tell you that.\" And then what website do you then return to when you want more advice? Google. Become the person everyone comes back to. Because they know what you say is fair and honest.  MOVE FROM AMBITION TO MEANINGWhen I was in my 20s I wanted to make a lot of money and have a lot of girlfriends. Those were my ambitions. Oh, and I wanted to write a novel because I thought it would get me the other two. Then I spent my entire 30s in a vast black hole confused by an indulgence in all the things I was ambitious for. \"Meaning\" takes you from simple pleasures to helping others. Then you feel real well-being. How do you find meaning? Stay healthy, have friendships that are positive, write down ten ideas a day, and be grateful. This is the mother of meaning. Everyone has time for the above. Everyone has time to be a superhero. WHAT ARE THE RESULTS?  YOU BECOME COMPETENT at the intersection of vision and meaning. You will get good at what you pursue. You will always know how to get good at what you do. YOUR NETWORK GETS LARGER. Because you are the source of integrity and competence they can trust. And they know you have their interests at heart. People are skeptical of this. I put a book on Amazon for 99 cents once (the lowest price they will let you) and someone gave me 1 star and said, \"I love Altucher\\'s writing but I can\\'t believe he\\'s selling out.\" For 99 cents. People can\\'t believe when someone steps out of the \"straight line\" out of \"the rule\". When you are the exception, the other 99 out of 100 will tear you down. That\\'s ok. Let them do that. In 80 years all 99 of them will be dead.  YOU GET HEALTHIERThere\\'s only seven million scientific studies on this. All you have to do really is: sleep 8 hours, laugh a lot, be grateful, and your brain gets better and you get healthier.  YOU FEEL BETTERYou don\\'t have to feel \"happy\" all the time. I don\\'t feel happy most of the time. Sometimes really bad things happen. I live right by the Hudson River. From my house I can see it. Sometimes the river is stormy, sometimes calm, sometimes all ice. But I can still stand there and watch it. I don\\'t have to swim in it every day. Being able to watch the river of emotions that swirl past you allows you to take good and bad situations with equal tranquility. This allows you then to keep pursuing your life of meaning instead of being swept away by the tides of anger and fear and envy and even ecstasy.  WHAT IF YOU DON\\'T HAVE MONEYI only learned this by repeatedly not having any money. I only learned this face down in the gutter. I don\\'t mean to engage in failure porn. This is actually a success story. This morning I\\'m emailing back and forth with a guy who gave up his cushy high-paying job to become a dog-sledder because he loved it. In 2006, I was constantly sick with worry about money. But when I started doing something I Ioved (stockpickr.com) I never thought about money (well, not for another two years). When you\\'re the source, as much money as you need flows towards you. And as the meaning and vision in your life gets larger, your network gets bigger, you become abundant. YOU BECOME KINDEvery single person has struggles. If you say, \"give me your list of complaints\" to anyone and force them to focus on it (me included) the list can go on for ten pages. But complaining is draining. Complaining only takes away energy from today and never solves the problems for tomorrow. Instead, spend that time being kind to the people around you. Treat everyone as if it\\'s their last day alive and they don\\'t know it. My guess is that will solve most of your complaints, whether it seems that way right now or not. Will this turn you into a Steve Jobs? No, probably not. This will turn you into a You. You don\\'t need to create a music player to save the world. When you die, nobody will say, \"thank god he was angry and bitter all the time\". People will say, \"I really benefited from his kindness.\" Not that life is all about death. But maybe it is. That\\'s the only thing we are aimed in a straight line at.(Photo by Steve Rotman)]',\n",
       "  47: '[Imagine self-publishing 500,000,000 books. It happened and I\\'m going to tell you how.Everyone says that technology right now gives more opportunity than ever to \"choose yourself\". That only now we have the opportunity to escape the cubicle and live a life of freedom. This is not true. Freedom starts with the choice inside yourself. Not the choices outside. These 500,000,000 books were mostly sold in the 1920s, 90 years ago.Opportunity always exists. All it takes is an imagination.Knowledge is a tiny subset of imagination. You get enough knowledge to understand the tiny box the world wants to keep you inside of - then imagination is the entire universe outside of that box.The Little Blue Books started by Emanuel Haldeman-Julius were tiny blue books of classics and original material that were sold for 5 cents each. There was no gatekeeper. He didn\\'t try to sell the books through a publisher. He didn\\'t try to sell books in a bookstore. He went straight to the masses. Here\\'s how he did it and I think the same thing, more or less, can be done today in any industry.It takes imagination. It takes becoming an idea machine. A) MAILING LISTEmanuel bought a failing newspaper that had a circulation of 175,000. That means he now had 175,000 names he could market to. How did he buy the newspaper? He borrowed money and put down half then paid for the other half over time. In other words, Haldeman-Julius used none of his own money and acquired a huge list of potential customers. The modern day version would be to build an email list. For instance, make a pamphlet, 100 ways to get out of debt. Use Facebook ads to give the pamphlet out for free while you collect email names.B) GET CUSTOMERS FIRSTHe didn\\'t make a single book. First he wrote to the list and said for five dollars he would send people 50 books at staggering intervals. 5,000 people \"subscribed\" and he had $25,000 to work with before he even printed a single book. At ten cents a book, people viewed it as a bargain and an easy way for anyone to build their own library and get educated. So he was solving an urgent problem for many people who wanted access to classics and other books but didn\\'t have much money. C) MAKE BOOKS CHEAPHe found books where the copyright expired: books like The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam or books written over 50 years older. He used cheap thin paper. He would shorten books (\"I would take out the boring text\") so they would fit into sizes of 32 pages or 64 pages.He used the printing presses of the newspaper he bought. Ultimately, he was printing so many books that his costs got even cheaper and he brought down the price from 10 cents to 5 cents per book. Just to put this in contrast: \"The Great Gatsby\" was selling for $2.00 at the time.D) TEACH PEOPLE TO WORK FOR HIMHe taught a mail-order course on \"how to write\" for $100. The assignments would be books that would then go into the Little Blue Books series. Books like \"Hypnotism Made Plain\" or \"What Every Girl Should Know About Marriage\" were not only cheap to buy the rights to - people actually PAID him to write them. So the actual production of books became a profit center for him.E) TEST TEST TESTHaldeman-Julius would stop printing a book if it started selling less than 10,000 books a year. But first he would see if he could rewrite or change the title to make it sell more.Changing the title proved to be the best way to increase sales. I think people don\\'t realize how important title is.When I was first trying to figure out the title of \"Choose Yourself\" I asked many people to help me. I originally wanted to call it \"The Choose Yourself Era\" but when I told that to a friend of mine who was an editor at Harper Collins she said, \"Era sounds like Error\".I then sat down with Tucker Max and Ryan Holiday, two super-experts on publishing. Each gave me a bunch of titles to work with.Ultimately I had no idea. So I made Facebook ads with each title on them. \"Choose Yourself\", \"Pick Yourself\", \"The Choose Yourself Era\" and about ten more. Within a day or two, the number of click-throughs was statistically significant enough I could see which title was the best.\"Choose Yourself\" had over 60% of the clicks despite testing about a dozen titles.Haldeman-Julius would see which titles were underperforming that he felt should perform better and he would change the title.For instance: \"The Tallow Ball\" by Guy de Maupassant sold 15,000 copies one year. Haldeman-Julius changed the title to \"A French Prostitute\\'s Sacrifice\" (which he felt was more accurate to the story anyway) and the next year it sold 54,700 copies.I wonder how many publishers and writers test their titles. The same book and one title sold THREE TIME as many books as the prior title.He would also test the content. He would take a book written by a classic author and rip out maybe up to half the book (\"the duller portions\") and see if it would sell more. Often it did. He was writing for people on the run.Another title he changed was a book called \"The Fleece of Gold\" which sold 6,000 copies one year. The next year, after the title change, the book sold 50,000 copies. Over eight times as much. The new title \"The Quest for the Blonde Mistress\".No author was too fancy for testing. He took Shakespeare\\'s \"None for the King\" (6,000 copies sold one year), changed it to: \"The Lustful King Enjoys Himself\" and sold 38,000 copies the next year.No rules. No fake gods to worship. F) MAKE A MONOPOLYHaldeman-Julius saw a big problem. Reading was being limited to the upper classes. They were printed and sold to be read in a home library. Not on a lunch break from the assembly line.So he priced them super-low, and made the books a tiny size: 3.5 x 5 inches, so they could fit in the pocket of a factory worker and be read on his lunch break.Many great modern authors (Saul Bellow, Ralph Ellison, etc) grew up reading LIttle Blue Books. G) FIND ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF DISTRIBUTIONAt the time, books were sold in bookstores. Haldeman-Julius changed that - selling books in pharmacies, toy stores, and even making vending machines that sold the Little Blue Books.The entire idea was to make it as easy as possible for readers to buy.H) ANALYTICSEveryone is like \"do you have analytics for your website\" as if it was an Internet invention.Haldeman-Julius would probably have gone broke without analytics.He advertised everywhere. He needed names for his list of people he would sell books to.And for each ad he\\'d take notes. He might have a line: \"NY Times, $2000 in ads, $4389.72 in sales\" and then he\\'d keep track of which books sold to which people, depending on which ad they came from.Because he sold so many books (1914 different books by the time the series ended), he also knew what categories people were interested in buying. So \"Prostitution in the Modern World\" (129,000 copies a year) and \"Did Jesus Ever Live\" (44,000 copies a year) might sell more than Upton Sinclair\\'s \"The Jungle\" so he would stop selling \"The Jungle\".Note, by contrast, \"The Great Gatsby\" sold 21,000 copies it\\'s first year with mega-advertising behind it. In fact, Fitzgerald never really picked up until after his death in 1940.I) HIGH BROW TO LOW BROWHaldeman-Julius\\'s goal was to get books into the hands of the regular worker. He didn\\'t care what they read. He sold them what they wanted to read. People wanted self-help. People wanted racy. But they also wanted to be educated and there was no other way to get educated other than through his books because of the low price.So \"Story of Plato\\'s Philosophy\" sold 40,000 books a year. \"Wit and Wisdom of Voltaire\" sold 16,500 copies a year.J) HOW TO APPLY TO NOW?Every day, Haldeman-Julius was exercising his idea machine:\\nwhat books can I sell?\\nhow can I improve sales of each book? (changing titles, rewriting content, ripping out \"dull\" text, etc)\\nwhat can I test in advertising (he would try out different words in the same magazines and see which resulted in better sales. Something many marketing agencies today don\\'t even do).\\nhow can I distribute better (selling on a mailing list, selling in vending machines, selling in pharmacies, etc)\\nhow can I make more money and make more books (offering for $100 a \"writing course\" where the assignments were be to make more books.)\\nusing analytics to test every aspect of the business long before the word \"analytics\" even existed.\\ndominating a niche (working class people who had never bought a book before)\\nselling what they wanted to read and eliminating bad sellers after testing failed.\\nEvery day this requires sitting down with a pad and simply writing down ideas. Like, \"Hmmm, I like Voltaire. What are ten books I can write, buy, have written, about Voltaire or written by Voltaire and then what are ten ways I can sell those books?\"Without exercising his idea machine he never would have bought a failing socialist newspaper and turned it into the biggest publishing company ever. Ultimately the series sold over 500,000,000 books. I don\\'t know of any other publisher that can make that claim.What happened to Emanuel Haldeman-Julius?He wrote a book criticizing the horror tactics of the FBI and J.Edgar Hoover right after World War II. The FBI investigated him. The IRS then investigated him. He ended up getting a jail sentence.So he drowned himself in his pool.Why is this an inspirational story? Haldeman-Julius was an idea machine who solved many hard business problems. That\\'s the only way to create a successful business life. That\\'s the way EVERYONE can create a successful life no matter what the circumstances or limitations.There\\'s never excuses that overcome ideas. People say execution is everything. It\\'s just not true. Ideas overwhelm excuses. Execution is just a natural subset of a good idea. But to live a life of well-being you have to also work every day to solve hard life problems. Life is never without difficulties. Chaos is part of nature. It\\'s being able to appreciate how special every event is - good or bad - that builds a life of character, a life of curiosity - a life that teaches through simple actions more than big results.I\\'ve had many bad things happen to projects I\\'m involved in. Even a few weeks ago, a disaster happened to a billion revenues company I advised. I wrote down what I learned from it, I become better for it, I move on. I can\\'t always do that. Sometimes it\\'s difficult. But I try to get better. 500,000,000 books creates many waves. But an ocean has calm, has storms, has waves. Connect to the ocean by finding the magic in everything. Even if \"magic\" sounds like a corny word. Ultimately be the ocean and not the wave.P.S. My new book is finally out! It\\'s taken me a year to put together all the skills I think are needed to create abundance in this new economy. I hope you write me with feedback and questions.Here\\'s what the initial reviews on this book have said:\"James Altucher did it again. I just finished and have to say it was a great read. Great insight into the future of wealth.\"\"I couldn\\'t wait for this book to come out. It was well worth the wait! Jam-packed with good ideas and advice for the budding entrepreneur. A must read!\"I\\'m really grateful for the response I\\'ve received so quickly. I feel we are quickly building a strong community of people who are deciding to \"choose themselves\".If you want to get it exclusively in hardcover, plus several other books by me, plus a newsletter which will be the equivalent of two additional chapters every month, claim your copy here.(Photo by Bust It Away Photography)]',\n",

Follow the stories here, and write your own (please include #IQuit somewhere in the body of your post).Well, I didnt quit. It was worse than that. It was the middle of a meeting. I was bored out of my mind. Plus I was nervous because my new boss told me dont worry about it when I asked about a raise. Dont worry about it means **** you.And my leg hurt. I had fallen the day before on the way to my lunch with my work friends.So in the middle of the meeting, I excused myself for the bathroom. I limped out. I said goodbye to the receptionist. I didnt take my coat, my bag, or any of books. My name might still be on my door.I took the elevator 49 floors down. I went up to Grand Central, took the train 70 miles north. I never went back to work.They tried calling me and emailing me. Even many years later I got an email from the boss saying, wed still love to have you.I never responded to any of the emails or calls, even that last one. You can judge me. It wasnt the most ethical way to leave a job. And Im not very good at confrontation.But sometimes its too much. Sometimes all the BS adds up until you cant move anymore, until you cant get out of bed.Whats so bad, honey?... says my imaginary friend who loves me every day.A) For every dollar of value I create, 50-80 percent of it is eaten by the boss or his boss, or his boss, or some machine.B) For every dollar I take home, 40 percent is taken by the government, 10 percent is taken by healthcare, and another few percent is taken by transportation to work.C) I was deluded into thinking my work friends were real friends. At work: everyone backstabs all the time.D) If I talk to anyone of the opposite sex I have to read three manuals and sign forms in triplicate with HR to make sure its ok.E) When Im trying to impress clients I have to pretend to like them.F) For breakfast and lunch Im eating nothing but junk food while Im in between meetings that crush my soul.G) From 6 a.m. until about 8 p.m. Im either getting ready for work, going to work, at work, or coming home from work. For potentially 50 years.H) My wife could care less about any job I have. And after awhile we forget why we met, why we fell in love, until finally theres a stranger lying next to me in bed for the rest of my life. 40 years later you die next to a stranger.I) Every dollar I spent on education was to build the safety net just in case I fell. Guess what: A job is what I fell into.J) If my boss yells at me all I can do is apologize. I used to leave the building and go to the bottom of the NY Public Library and just wait to get calm.I mapped out all the public bathrooms in a six block radius. Nobody wants to pee next to their boss. Its disgusting and humiliating.We were given our hands to love and create. To touch and inspire.Find real meaning in your life instead of a means to some financial goal or pleasure.When you find meaning that delivers value, art, and helps others fulfill their own dreams, you find happiness.That happiness is what gets you out of bed in the morning. What allows you to make real meaningful connections with other people. What allows you to create the world that you always aspired you would live in.You were once a little boy. You played in a sandbox with your friends. You loved people and built castles.Now go. Now go play again. The world is filled with meaning.

       "  49: '[I\\'m feeling bad about the Neanderthals. But for $30 million I can buy one. Seriously. Since we mapped the Neanderthal genome, for $30 million I can now find a surrogate mother (Claudia Azula Altucher?) and a professor at MIT can, I don\\'t know, inject a Neanderthal into her womb.Or something like that. Something science. Here\\'s some science: school taught me that neanderthals were a different species.But you can\\'t have kids with a different species. That\\'s the RULES that define \"species\"!But now it turns out we all have somewhere between 1 and 5% Neanderthal in us. Which means kids happened.Which means a Neanderthal woman kissed a human man. Maybe, at least once, a Neanderthal said to a human, \"I love you.\" Which means maybe violence happened. And a baby was born. And then something bad happened.All of this is to say: Screw Paleo. Screw paleo diets. I\\'m so sick of the paleo diet.All of this is to say: the paleo diet is a lie. And yet it\\'s not quite. More contradictions.I used to eat cereal for breakfast. Two bagels for lunch. And pasta and wine for dinner. The All-Carb diet. I miss those days.Now I try to be \"paleo\". You can\\'t eat anything. Peanuts? Forget it. I tried to get away with popcorn (\"it\\'s mostly air\"). Forget it.Gluten-free? Believe it or not - that\\'s not paleo. Check for gliacin. If it\\'s got that in there (to get the \"gluten\" effect) then it\\'s even worse.Ezekiel bread? Puke! What does it even mean that it is sprouted bread? Is it like a bread plant?Fruit? Forget it. Too much sugar. And I hate vegetables and meat. I can\\'t eat anything.I don\\'t know what the answer is or what the right diet is.Important: here are the areas where the most people aged 100 or over live: Okinawa (rice-based diet), Sardinia (pasta), Costa Rica (maize / corn). All live off of starch-based diets and very low animal food.Here\\'s the argument for paleo: that for 3 million years, homo sapiens and their ancestors didn\\'t live off of wheat.We were nomads and foragers and ate anything we could find: plants, bone marrow, nuts, rodents, whatever.It was only a mere evolutionary blip ago (10,000 years) that wheat basically domesticated us.Important: the success of a species is not determined by it\\'s happiness but by its ability for its DNA to replicate itself.Unfortunately, humans are not the winner. Wheat is.Around 10,000 BC, give or take a few thousand years in various parts of the world: Wheat took control of the human race and forced us to settle down and grow it.What? Wheat.The results have been a total disaster for humans accept for the fact that we now have croissants to eat. Mmmmm. And French Toast and Pancakes.Now that we have to protect our vast quantities of croissants we had to settle down into cities and kingdoms. We have to pay taxes. We have wars. We have religions. We burn down forests to grow the wheat.Lots of good things.Diet interlaces with lifestyle. You can\\'t separate them. THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO LIVING PALEOA) FOODI was talking to Nassim Taleb about the paleo diet and he reminded me of one important fact: humans didn\\'t eat a nice three meals a day spread out every 4 or 5 hours.Sometimes we\\'d go for a day without food simply because we couldn\\'t find any. If you want to eat paleo you have to randomize the time you eat.We probably also ate different things every day depending on what we found that day.Nuts, plants, marrow. Marrow!Do you really think it\\'s likely we killed a cow and then some lion waited in line while we ate first?We were LAST in line when it came to eating the meat so we probably ate more marrow. Marrow is soft and mushy and comes from inside the bone of an animal.It\\'s also about 96% fat. So if someone tells you to stop eating fat you can tell them that\\'s basically all humans ate fat for three million years.The longest living \"cousin\" in the homo genus is the homo erectus which lived about 1.5 million years (I think sapiens have only been around 200-300,000 years). There\\'s no photographs but I really can\\'t imagine that members of homo erectus were obese and lying around watching \"House of Cards\".Let me just say: you know that chart that shows chimps on one side, then chimps slowly evolve into humans by standing up straight? There\\'s like 5 steps in between. I\\'m somewhere in the middle. I\\'m always sort of jealous or envious when I hear there was once a species named Homo Erectus.Erectus! Back to the real paleo diet: the health benefits of eating bone marrow? Boosted immune system, helps cancer, improves digestion, improves the brain, and on and on.Do I eat bone marrow? Hell no! But I guess if it was on the menu I\\'d try it. I probably should. A Bone marrow brioche sandwich. Here\\'s what I look for in a diet:\\ngood sleep. I don\\'t want to wake up in the middle of the night with stomach pains like I did for years. So early dinners and no alcohol seem to help with that regardless of what I eat (well, no dessert).\\neasy digestion. Which, for me, simply means softer foods than I ate as a kid (no bagels unfortunately for me anymore).\\nenergy at the right times. Which means I try to eat dinner for lunch (eggs, vegetables, or fish) and breakfast for dinner (pancakes!) . \\nAnd, for breakfast, drugs. I mean...coffee. I mean coffee with coconut oil.B) PALEO INTELLIGENCEMost people are not what I would call paleo-intelligent. I am very paleo-stupid.In fact, for hundreds of years we\\'ve been encouraged to be paleo-stupid.We\\'ve glorified and even worshipped the concept of \"focus\". 100 years ago if you worked in a factory you might operate one machine over and over again, a 1000 times in a day, 6 days a week, for 60 years.And even now, with the Internet revolution, pseudo-entrepreneurs are encouraged to \"focus\" much like the factory worker.We are told in schools to find our \"major\" and then in graduate school we are forced to get more and more specific under the mentorship of people who did the same thing twenty years earlier.The average successful person probably has close to 20 or 30 careers in his life. This is a paleo career. Our paleo ancestors knew every plant and animal in a several mile radius or larger of where they lived. They knew what was edible, what was poisonous, where the lions lived, what bars the Neanderthals caused trouble in, and so on.I don\\'t even know my neighbors.I wish I were a little more intelligent about the basics of living. Like how to use a microwave. Or assemble a baby carriage. I have a PQ (paleo quotient) of about 50.There\\'s even evidence that paleo people had larger brains than us. They had to keep it all in their heads. No google to help them keep track of everything. No evernote.\"NO! That\\'s poisonous!\" That\\'s what paleo people could say. I can\\'t say that. Except about bad relationships.So gradually as a species we\\'ve been less intelligent despite all of our great war machines and stock exchanges and C++ and many other fun things.C) PALEO MATERIALISMNobody knows. But my guess is: paleo-people didn\\'t own anything. How could they? They were nomads. They moved.45,000 years ago when humans crossed the solid arctic tundra from Siberia to Alaska in -60 degree temperatures they weren\\'t carrying a lot of books and plates and beds and tables.But in just a few thousand years after that they inhabited every region from Alaska down to Argentina, passing through every weather regime possible without dying off. No other species in history has ever done that.The only way they could do that was by owning little and being super adaptive to every environment including the new foods and animals they found in that environment. New food didn\\'t kill them. (\"Ahhh! Bread will kill us!\"). They adapted and lived and built empires. Starch-based empires. Now we\\'re mostly stuck. Our masters have nailed us into our current locations like a hammer. People are often afraid to change or move but for three million years that\\'s ALL we did was change and move. It was the key way we survived and succeeded. Being good at adapting, changing, uncertainty, and a little fear, is the soup for success.And it was only when we started owning things that we started going to war to protect those things and building stories around those objects about why they were important enough to protect.And then we invented the great story of money. Paleo people had no money.D) PALEO EXERCISEJust think of what skills you need to hunt for animals and forage for food. It\\'s simple.You needed to run. You need to have good reflexes. You need some strength. You probably need to stretch and climb and have balance.And yes, you probably need to kill people with your bare hands.So that\\'s all the exercise you should focus on.Nassim mentioned to me he had special sneakers that modeled the shape of the foot more accurately and he spends 20 hours a week walking on non-flat terrain. They probably didn\\'t pave roads a 70,000 years ago.E) PALEO SLEEPIt\\'s simple: sleep when it\\'s dark outside. Be up when it\\'s light outside.It\\'s hard for people to do this. But a few tips:- blackout shades so no street light comes in- no screen time after 6pm- eat as early as possibleAny screens at all makes the brain think it\\'s the middle of the day. Not paleo.F) PALEO LOVEEvery tribe probably had an alpha male and female. Chances are the alphas had more sex than the others. But we don\\'t know anything at all about this.One thing we do know: the neurotransmitters in our brain evolved based on how we were able to get along with other members of our tribe.Companionship and friendship are the keys to happiness.For instance: if we love someone (and hence increased our chances of reproducing) then oxytocin gets triggered.If we found food that we wanted to share with the tribe, or if we saw food that we would like to eat (perhaps found by someone else), then dopamine would be triggered. Either way we would want to form bonds in the tribe so we can eat.If we got hurt or were being chased by a lion (separating us from our tribe), then endorphins (naturally produced morphine) get triggered (\"runner\\'s high\")And if we felt like the tribe might no longer like us, cortisol would get triggered and we\\'d be anxious about where we stood with the tribe.Paleo love means today I can try to make a friend, call a friend, love someone, kiss my daughters, kiss kiss kiss. Paleo kissing. PALEO STORYTELLINGHumans killed everyone else because we can tell stories. And gossip. And lie. Religions, cities, money are all big stories that allow millions of people to cooperate with others who believe in the same stories. It\\'s built into us that we love stories. The classic experiment is that if you sell a product on Ebay and have a story around it, people will pay up to 300% more than if you have a story about the product. So:\\nABS: always be storytelling.\\nReach out to friends every day.\\nRandomize your food in every way (and eat soft foods)\\nI vary my daily routine\\nSleep when it\\'s dark\\nI own as few things as possible\\nBe intelligent about your surroundings and the world you live in.\\nThink about today. No need to plan too much for the future. The best predictor of a success future is a successful today.\\nThat\\'s a true paleo diet. A paleo life. Will this make your life better? I\\'m not sure. It\\'s certainly made mine better. One more secret: humans are the only species to develop a pre-frontal cortex. What does that mean? It means we not only evolve. We adapt. That\\'s why we can read and nobody else can. That\\'s why we can tell stories (\"money\") that both Al-Qaeda and Warren Buffett believe in. So Paleo life means being ok with adapting. Means adapting faster than the people around you. Paleo uncertainty is the key to paleo success. I would love to have a Neanderthal child. To raise one. We would arm wrestle. It would get taller than me. Probably smarter than me. And then maybe I would kill it. I threw all my belongs out a month or so ago. Paleo materialism. Maybe it\\'s too early to tell the results. But one thing I found out is that I accidentally threw out a lot of the things that were in my head also. So I don\\'t care anymore.(Photo by John Connell)]',\n",
       "  50: '[Ugh, then there are those times when I feel dead inside. I wake up early and swing on the pre-school swingset like a pervert.

A constipation of life that just won\\'t get digested until it wears you down, makes it hard to move, forces your face closer to the grind that will kill you.When I spoke with David Levien he told me about his commute to work. Seeing the people asleep or reading the paper and he felt that sense of being bloated. The feeling of \"Will I fall asleep?\" So on the commute he wrote a page a day of what became a bestselling novel.Albert Einstein was dying from the rigid eight hour day at the patent office. He was so bored he was even denied his first attempt at getting a promotion. He would try to dig out the crevices that time had carved into his routine so he could work on his own theories of magic, since the magic of today always becomes the science of tomorrow.I was told all the time in my 20s, \"you have to pay your dues\". I was told this by people with some higher rank than me. As if they had paid their dues. But one man\\'s rank is another man\\'s stank.You pay your dues when you finally come to that realization that something is missing.That whatever they told you in the past: your religion, your parents, your friends, your bosses - is wrong. Not for them. Since who knows the price of another\\'s life.But for you.The \"dues\" are when you find your authentic voice. The singing voice that stands out in the world chorus. \"Paying the dues\" is when you open up that voice to its full range.When you sing.B) DESPERATIONI realized something was missing but didn\\'t know what to do.I thrashed. I would read books. I would see which people I would want to model myself after. I would study them. I\\'d write ideas down each day. I\\'d cry because these were the times I was most lonely, when one group was disappearing and another set of friends and colleagues had yet to find me.Trust that the desperation will go away. You\\'ll find people to love. You\\'ll write ideas down every day. I finally learned to be grateful for my desperation. This is the egg that will crack open and give birth to new life.It\\'s going to happen many times. Even every day. Go forth and multiply.C) TOTAL CONFUSIONWhen you speak in that authentic voice for the first time, you say words you never said before. Maybe nobody has ever said them. You\\'re going to scare the people around you. You\\'re going to scare yourself. Because people close to you will react. You might be wrong. When you write the first page of the novel, you can\\'t possibly know how it will end. When you start a business, not a single person in the world can predict the outcome.Odeo is always my favorite example. Started by a guy who had built a hundred million dollar company previously. Everyone trusted his idea was good. A platform for podcasting. Huge idea!Many great investors invested. But no customers. One of his employees started a side project. Sending messages back and forth. He got 10,000 users. A small amount. The founder offered all of the investors a chance to get their money back. 100% of them accepted. The founder then changed the name of the company to the side project.All the best investors in the world missed out on investing in Ev Williams\\' new project, Twitter.The world is changing very quickly. In a few years, your 3D printed car (your 3D printed food) will be dropped off at your house maybe every month. Companies like Coursera and Khan Academy and Udemy will destroy overpriced colleges. AirBnB will end the need for hotels. New technologies in batteries will end our reliance on the pervasive \"grid\".There\\'s no answer. There\\'s no guru who can say what will happen. I\\'ve started 20 businesses and watched and cried while 17 of them failed. I\\'m divorced and have lost two homes. Many friends I love, no longer love me. When the tide shifts, it\\'s too hard to figure out what companies will go down with it. I\\'ve seen many billion dollar companies fail within a matter of weeks or months. The only thing common among all of them: lack of character at the top.You build character by remaining calm in the confusion. Sometimes I haven\\'t been able to do this. One time my mother said to me, \"I can\\'t believe you are my son.\" Character is a hard thing to cultivate. At least for me. But it\\'s possible for everyone. This is also called, \"Paying your dues\".D) SELF-SABOTAGETwo different friends of mine are self-sabotaging themselves right this second in two very different companies.I can\\'t tell them because what do I know? But they will do it. When I was a kid, the world\\'s record for losing the most amount of money in one day was held by a young man named Ross Perot. If I remember right, in 1969 he lost a billion in a day when the stock market fell.He said much later, \"Most people give up just when they\\'re about to achieve success. They quit on the one yard line. They give up at the last minute of the game one foot from a winning touchdown.\"I didn\\'t used to believe in self-sabotage. I thought that was an excuse. But now I see how it happens. You\\'re so close but you\\'re afraid to take the chance and disappoint people. You say later, \"I was just being honest\" or \"I couldn\\'t take the chance\".I self-sabotage myself all the time when I\\'m afraid to disappoint someone else. Or when I\\'m not honest about my real feelings and desires I tend to mix them up so badly until it\\'s all a big mess. Or when I think I don\\'t deserve the good fortune that I\\'ve worked for.Why wouldn\\'t I think I deserve it? That seems fake. I have no clue. But it\\'s true. Somewhere deep inside there\\'s a hole and it can\\'t be filled except by sabotage. Recognizing it, noticing it, working around it, is the third step on the path to change. E) ANXIETYThe other day I had to give a talk. Everyone was smart and successful and knew more than me about the topic of the conference.What could I teach them? How could I start to get their attention?A friend of mine is working on a company that has a technology for detecting what part of the country every strand of marijuana comes from. He explained some of the science to me. I mildly misinterpreted it to start my speech.\"Did you know marijuana plant has both a penis and a vagina,\" I started my talk with. And then explained what I meant. Then related it back to the topic: marketing. People laughed. But I had been afraid.I died in another talk. Everyone in the audience was very successful. So I gulped down a can of coke but didn\\'t swallow the coke. Instead I walked on stage and pretended to throw up. Dead silence.I have to go to a big meeting next week. I am helping a company and maybe millions of dollars are at stake. Will I look too weird? Will I have nothing to say? Will I say the wrong thing?Anxiety is the doorknob. The doorway leads to change. But you have to open the doorknob first.F) SOMEONE LISTENSDavid Levien wrote his book on his commute. His best friend read it and loved it. Kay Cannon wrote her script on the subway over three years. A studio then made it into a movie.Einstein slaved away in the patent office and wrote \"e=mc squared\". A physics journal decided to publish that equation from a third level patent clerk.Frank McCourt, now a bestselling author, wrote his first book in his 60s. His memoir, Angela\\'s Ashes. Someone agreed to publish it.Guess what? 35% of entrepreneurs last year started their first business at the age of 50 or older.Lisa Gable had never started a company before. At the age of 70 she got disgusted with her falling bra-straps. She made a bra strap that help everything up. Strap-mate, now a multi-million dollar company.Coolio wrote lyrics every day for 17 years in a row before having a single hit. Someone finally listened. Somehow his voice stopped imitating others and became his own. At some point you\\'ve paid the dues and everything begins to pay off. You begin to get that return. People listen. You stood out and everyone hated you but then fight through that and now you begin to have an impact.G) SLOW DOWNWhen you find your voice, slow down. There\\'s no rush. Out of six billion people, you\\'re the only one with your voice, your experiences, your ideas, your wisdom. There\\'s no competition to be you. Someone once complimented Arthur Rubinstein on his piano playing. He said, \"It\\'s not the piano playing. I handle the notes no better than anyone else does. It\\'s the pauses - that\\'s where art resides.\"When your change kicks in. This is the moment not to plan for the future, but to find the pauses in the present.This is what makes or break the person who surfs the world of change. Too often I rushed into the future and fell off the cliff, with all my limbs broken.I wish I had done this: respect the pause, respect the people around me, respect that I have to write down ideas every day, be grateful that I got to this step. Gratitude fights the gravity that tries to pull you down and prevent you from taking the next step.When you slow down, everything lasts longer.H) EVERYTHING CYCLESWhen I follow my own advice, my life changes almost completely every six months.But often things go really bad. A few months ago, a company I was involved in fell apart. There was corruption. Things got ugly. I was so disappointed. I didn\\'t see it coming. I hit a low point. Low points and high points happen in every creature on the planet except in our Facebook feeds.You have to know in a low point that it\\'s time to rest a bit. At a high point you act. At a low point you rest.This doesn\\'t mean turn on the TV. Turning on the TV turns off the rest of the world. Do the opposite. Turn on the rest of the world by being with people you love, finding the gratitude that is ALWAYS buried in difficult situations, writing down ideas every day (one in 100 might even be good).I was at a low point and had a hard time getting out of bed. Until finally I told myself, this is the perfect time to follow my own stories. And so I did. And then things got better. I wrote 20 things I learned from the experience. I figured out how to turn the death of this psychic murder into the birth of a new life for me.I) FIND YOUR TEACHERSWhen you change, it\\'s like you\\'ve walked through a portal and entered a new world.In this new world, you need teachers to show you the way. You can find your teachers in real life. You can find them through books. You can spy on them and model your life after their examples.Everything that happens to you, every person you encounter was sent specifically by the mad scientists who created this virtual reality to teach you. Their methods are insidious and not out of the standard textbook so you can\\'t be fooled. But learn.Eventually you pass them as you further develop your voice, as the world now becomes something not that you entered but something that you impacted and changed. Now it\\'s your world and you are the teacher.J) REPEATIt never ends.---\"Paying your dues\" has nothing to do with working hard. It has nothing to do with the failure porn so common right now.It has everything to do with that terrible white sunrise. The one you didn\\'t want to happen. The one that wakes you up while everyone else is still asleep.(Photo by Wes Peck)]',\n",
       "  51: '[The best negotiator I knew always acted like an idiot. He acted so well that I thought he was really stupid. I also thought at the time that he was my best friend.That was probably an act also. Just two years later he stopped talking to me forever.I ran into him in the street the other day. He smiled and shook my hand. I felt warm, like he liked me again. Then he was gone.Negotiation is first about warmth. Two sides deciding if they want to be friends with each other. If they want to be in the same tribe, fighting side by side in this harsh world.After that it\\'s about vulnerability. Making yourself into the type of person someone else wants to take care of.---This is not a mystery. When a baby is born the negotiation begins. It lasts until at least the baby is an adult.My oldest turns 16 tomorrow. She negotiates with me every day. I love her. But maybe that\\'s what makes her such a tough negotiator.I\\'m not so good at realizing where all the boundaries are. Between the outer me and the inner me. Between the me that always loves her and the me that wants her to love me back.I guess that\\'s how I am with everyone. If they don\\'t love me back, I\\'m afraid, I\\'ll be less happy. If I\\'m honest where the boundaries are, then we can begin to set up the rules. Then love begins.Tricky!---I\\'ve probably seen over 1,000 negotiations in action. I\\'ve probably been directly involved in 100 or so.Every day life is a negotiation. I\\'m not talking in this post about the every day negotiations although the same rules apply. I\\'m talking about negotiations where careers and money and reputations and maybe love is at stake.For me, that latter is the hardest. So take my advice with a grain of salt.In fact, I\\'d rather tell you all the ways in which I\\'ve messed up in negotiations. Because this is really the classroom I learned in. A) IF YOU HAVE A SMALL LIST OF TERMS, YOU LOSE.Let\\'s say you are selling a company. One side is usually focused on the final price. That side will henceforth be called \"the loser\".Make your list bigger: what are the terms of the non-compete, what is the length of the earn out, what are the salaries of the new top executives, what are the perks, what are the options packages.Or if it\\'s a job: what are the responsibilities, what are similar people being paid, what is the path to higher promotions, what are the details of health, vacation, moving expenses, reviews, etc. The side with the bigger list can give up the nickels for the dimes to the loser. B) IF YOU DON\\'T GET ENOUGH SLEEP, YOUR WILLPOWER WILL BE ZERO.Carl Icahn, one of the best investors in the world, uses this technique.He schedules his negotiations for the early evening.Our peak mental ability (according to Dan Ariely, author of Predictably Irrational, and many other books) is approximately 2 hours after we wake up until about 4 hours after we wake up.And then throughout the day, our willpower slowly leaks away until we sleep again. That\\'s why we watch TV and eat donuts at night rather than when we first wake up.So Carl Icahn will sleep until 4pm and then go to the negotiation at 6pm.On the other side of the table are exhausted lawyers who have been working all day.BAM! Who do you think will win that negotiation.C) MOST PEOPLE THINK SHORT-TERM. BE THE VISIONARY AND YOU WIN.Applied Semantics didn\\'t want to sell to Google in 2001. They had raised some money and thought they could make it.A few months earlier I had made the mistake of turning them down when they were raising money. \"The search engine business is dead!\" said the greatest prophet of modern times. Me.Larry Page told the CEO of Applied, \"I\\'m not getting off the phone until you say yes\".So Applied Semantics sold themselves in exchange for 1% of Google. ONE PERCENT.This was before Google went public. So it was a total unknown what those shares would be worth. Larry Page had the vision of where they would be.Applied Semantics became the Adsense division of Google. Which now accounts for 99% of Google\\'s revenues.Are they upset? Shouldn\\'t they have sold for more?Of course not. They sold for over a billion in value and created the end goal of making one of the best companies in the world.You can only get rich once. Don\\'t worry so much about maximizing your percentage of something. One percent of $250 billion is better than 100% of nothing, as the saying goes.---I\\'m going to take a break for a second and say something that has saved me considerable stress.NEVER WORRY ABOUT WHAT IS IN SOMEONE ELSE\\'S POCKET.Let other people do well. Then you will do well.Ok, back to what you shouldn\\'t do in a negotiation.---D) DON\\'T SAY NO.I say this even though I wrote the book, \"The Power of No\". What I really mean here is, bury your NO inside of a YES.I was negotiating with one company once. They wanted me to be an advisor. I said, \"no\". But not like that. What I really said was, \"You have a great company and I am happy to give advice.\"What a great way to say no! They kept calling. They really wanted me. I said, \"Here\\'s what you should do without me\" and I totally laid out the plan they should do. I did it for free. That was another way of saying \"no\".This made them want me as an advisor even more. Eventually they offered enough that I said, \"yes\". They followed my advice exactly. The advice that I had already given for free.There\\'s a well-known improv technique of \"Yes, and...\"In improv, the first performer creates the premise. The second performer can\\'t change it or reject it, he can only build on it.In a negotiation if someone says, \"well, you\\'re only worth $1 because you have X\" you can say, \"yes, and we also have Y so let\\'s take that into consideration.\"Suddenly your value is higher because you didn\\'t start a fight. You agreed and added.E) MANY PEOPLE NEGOTIATE WITH THE WRONG MATH.This is the part many people don\\'t get right and it\\'s hard to explain. I\\'ll take a simple example. I don\\'t know if the negotiation took place this way but it describes what I mean.Why did Facebook buy Instagram for $1 billion. Instagram had 11 employees and zero revenues.On that basis, maybe Instagram was worth...nothing. Or close to it.But maybe the negotiation went something like this:Instagram: Let\\'s agree to a formula first on how we should value our company.Facebook: Err...Ok.Instagram: Forget about our revenues for a second. But let\\'s just assume we can earn $X for every user you have (call that number $Y). Pay us $X * Y.Facebook: Err.Ok.Instagram probably then showed how they could add $1 in value for every customer Facebook had. Facebook has a billion users. So a billion dollars.Come to the negotiation with your formula. Know how to fill in the variables before the other side does. Every good negotiator does this.The reason I know this? Because this is how I\\'ve lost many negotiations to good negotiators. I\\'ve had very good mentors on this one aspect of negotiation.Because we all negotiated the formula, but not the price, in advance, then everyone has already said \"Yes\" to something and they basically have to stick with it.(Well, they don\\'t have to. But it\\'s high stakes and you don\\'t want to seem like you don\\'t live up to your word.)F) IF YOU HOPE FOR ONLY ONE OUTCOME, YOU NEVER GET ITI really wanted my company, Stockpickr, to be bought by Google. I threw everything I could into the basket. I would send them love notes in the middle of the night. Seriously, I was in love with the woman doing the negotiating. I didn\\'t have a technical team was the problem. We built the whole site for a few thousand dollars. I had one partner. We had 99% margins on our revenues but Google likes technical teams.Oh well.I then focused on getting alternatives. I called AOL, Yahoo, Reuters, Forbes. Then thestreet.com bought us.Sometimes people write me and say, \"I sent my ten ideas to my favorite company but they haven\\'t called back. Should I call them again?\"That\\'s the wrong question. The right question is: \"What\\'s the next 100 companies I should write to?\"It\\'s no secret that being able to walk away from a negotiation is the best starting point in a negotiation.G) SMARTER PEOPLE LOSE.This is what I like to say: you guys are the experts at this, we\\'ve just been focused on building our product, company, art, whatever.Then I say, \"if you were me, what would you ask for?\" I ask them advice. Because they are the experts. It\\'s not a lie.If you are applying for a job with someone more senior than you, why not ask the more senior guy for advice? He knows more than you.Very often they give very good advice.H) IF YOU NEGOTIATE WITH A LOSER, YOU LOSE.If two sides are negotiating, you need at least one champion for what you are doing on the other side.One time I was working with a company and GE offered us a billion dollars for the company. Yes, a BILLION.They laid out the time frame. \"The deal will be closed by November 15\" said the highest ranking person in the room from GE.I went back to the CEO of the company I was advising and told him that.He said, \"Who were you talking to?\" I told him.He said, \"100% chance this deal doesn\\'t happen\". But they offered! I told him. They actually made an offer.\"Trust me. No way. There\\'s no real champion for you on the other side who is close to being a decision maker. She is 5 rungs below the decision maker and she\\'s your only champion.\"And he was right. That deal did not happen. They found a better way to get what they wanted for 1/200 of the price.You can only cross the bridge to the other side if someone strong is there holding out their hand to pull you in.I) THE DEAL IS NOT THE FINAL DEAL. DON\\'T RELAX! People think when they agree on a deal, that\\'s the end of the negotiation.I\\'m sorry to say, that is only the beginning of the negotiation.There\\'s agreeing, there\\'s signing, and there\\'s closing. The final two steps are equally important and everyone assumes they are easy. They aren\\'t. They are excruciatingly painful. The honeymoon period lasts for two days after you agree. Then there can be another six months to go.Agreeing is easy. \"I\\'ll buy your product or business for $X.\"Signing a deal involves all the little things that are the nickels and dimes (see above).Closing a deal means both sides delivering everything they represented in a deal.At each stage of this is buyer\\'s remorse and seller\\'s remorse and often things have to be renegotiated.So every day after agreement, make it a point to stay in touch, be friends, keep focusing on the vision (particularly with the champion for your deal on the other side), have just as much energy to close all the details, keep in touch with the lawyers to make sure paperwork is going through, keep working on the alternatives (since the negotiation is not done til it\\'s DONE), and so on.So many deals fall apart after agreement. You don\\'t need this pain in your life.---LOVE IS A NEGOTIATION.Taking another break here in the post. Please forgive me for not laying it out all perfect.When I used to go on a first date I was both scared and excited. I\\'d get excited first, \"she wants to date me!\" And then I\\'d get scared. \"Ugh, what do I do now?\"I\\'d literally do homework for the date. I\\'d find out her interests and read books on them. I\\'d watch comedy beforehand. I\\'d think of things to say and questions to ask. I\\'m not saying preparation is bad.One time I was an expert on Kaballah. Another time I had to be an expert on Al Gore (long story). Another time I had to bribe the counter girl to pretend she knew me before my date arrived. I\\'d be too scared to show my real self so I\\'d have to get her to like my fake self long enough for me to feel comfortable showing the real me.Sometimes that never happened. In many cases I never had a real me. I was always jumping through hoops to keep the fake me going. I had to keep bribing the counter girl everytime we went for yogurt. This is the difference between agreeing on a deal (the first date) and closing (trust, love, real compassion). This is a problem I\\'m afraid I will always have. I hope I am getting better bit by bit.---J) MOST DEALS DON\\'T WORK OUT.You agree, you sign, you close, and STILL it\\'s not the end.Don\\'t be the guy (or woman) who falls apart now that all the energy of the deal has been expended.It\\'s a negotiation and a deal because NOW there is work to do. There is a common vision to be achieved. There is a fantasy that must be made into reality.Be that person. Be the one who delivers. You have a new baby in your hands as the result of this negotiation.Now the hard work begins. Raise that baby to be a good adult.(Photo by Georgie Pauwels)]',\n",
       "  52: '[I have never met a person who suddenly became happy simply by \"finding their passion\".If my passion had come crawling across my bed during any of my lowest 50 moments in life and started nibbling on my ear I would\\'ve just pushed it away. Usually I wanted money or sex and I felt passion would get me those. But in those low moments I felt I was a failure and undeserving. For instance, I thought if I published a book I would be happy .. and get money and sex. Or if I became a millionaire (one MILLION dollars!) then there would be the trickle down theory of happiness.Ugh, so wrong. What a fool I am!Life cycles. So when you see yourself in a low point: start with the below and the rest follows (sex, french toast, smiling, money, and maybe some passion).Don\\'t forget that when the lights come on inside of you, everyone in the world can see a little better.Good bye and good luck. I do these three things:A) INNER ACTIONSWhat you do on the inside effects your brain and chemistry and blood and DNA much more than anything you can do on the outside.I know many people who decide they will never be happy again. Never make money again. Never find romance again.And, of course, there\\'s no way to argue with them. It\\'s often hard to listen to them. And eventually you avoid them. They will prove themselves right.This is not law of attraction. Money doesn\\'t rain down on the lucky (mostly) or the optimistic. But it certainly doesn\\'t arrive at the doors of people who barricade their houses.And it can\\'t happen if you are stuck in bed. Or bloated with the enormity of your problems. Or satiated with the tiredness of your daily routine.\\nTake a walk. Be a mover and not a statue.\\nWhen you get tired, sleep instead of eat.\\nRead books that are inspirational. For me, this helps rewire the brain for a few hours. It\\'s hard at first. The brain tries to slap you: \"I don\\'t need rewiring\", but for me it works.\\nMOST importantly, feel the bonds of friendship. For three million years, we live for the tribe. This triggers oxytocin and makes us happier.Sometimes your friends and family change. Instead of talking to someone who is labeled a \"friend\", talk to someone you \"like\".Even when I\\'m depressed, someone I like can sometimes find their way through the maze and make me laugh.Be creative. Yesterday I was feeling down. I had just flew in from Miami to New York. It\\'s cold here. It was warm there. Did I waste my time in Miami because I was too busy? Too many thoughts!So on my waiter\\'s pad I did two things: I drew a picture of Claudia. It was horrible. I can\\'t draw. But I wasn\\'t aiming to be in a museum.I just wanted to light that part of my brain on fire.And then I wrote down a list \"The art of creativity\" by examining the ways a friend of mine is insanely creative. That was my list of ten for the day.And then I was grateful. I\\'m in New York! I was in Miami! I\\'m reading a good book!Your inner actions light you up, turn you on fire, send laser beams out of your eyes, teleport all the negative muons away and only positive tetrons surround you and light up the world around you.FACT!B) OUTER ACTIONSInner actions get the fire going. But now they have to burn the house down.I think of the last four podcasts I\\'ve done and one piece of advice from each: Gretchen Rubin - author of \"The Happiness Project\" - hug your spouse for six seconds to get the oxytocin going. Six seconds! When I read it, I tried it on Claudia. It worked. Claudia was saying \"Mmmm\" by the sixth second.I told Gretchen I did this and it worked. \"The six seconds are longer than you think, right?\" And she was right. But it works. Scot Adams, author of \"Dilbert\" - \"Science shows that when you fake a smile long enough, you\\'ll eventually be happier\". I know that when I listen to music I smile. So I\\'m listening to Kashmir by Led Zeppelin right now. And smiling. AJ Jacobs, author of \"Drop Dead Healthy\" - \"Fake it til you make it\" - He was telling me sometimes when he begins a project he feels like, \"Who am I fooling here? I can\\'t do this!\" But then he acts like he can. And then he does it.I\\'m a victim of outrage porn almost every day. Someone always wants to yell at me. \"You can\\'t do that!\" Only one solution: I hit delete on them in my head.  Jairek Robbins - Author of \"Live It\" and son of Tony Robbins, \"Burst out of your bed! Just burst out! That will tell your body it\\'s ready for an exciting day.\"I did it in the AirBnB I was staying at. I didn\\'t know that the bed was broken. The two front legs collapsed and the front of the bed fell to the ground. That\\'s ok! EXCELSIOR!Care for each person you meet as if you secretly know they are going to die tomorrow but they don\\'t know it yet. They need your compassion. Or, if that is too morbid, pretend you are their mother. My baby! These outer actions make me happy.C) SAVE THE WORLD.What are billion-people problems? Problems that hurt a billion people. Energy is first. Clean water is another. Brutality against women another. Hunger is another. Pollution. War, terrorism, lack of education, problems of aging, poverty, etc.Forget about your problems for a second. I know there is the mortgage to pay. Most of my life I have never made enough to pay my bills and I have lost homes, family, friends as a result.I can obsess on these things. Or I can save the world.Is it really that easy? Can I really save the world?Sure. I just called a friend of mine who is a chemist. He has a technology that might improve the way we get energy. Make it cheaper. Less pollution. I have no idea about chemistry.But just talking to him and encouraging him I felt like I was helping the world. Another thing: my kid\\'s school just started a chess program. I wrote to the head of the program. I said I could help. I could be available to teach or play games or whatever. Education!I know that when I drop a teeny pebble in the middle of the ocean, eventually the tiniest of ripples hits every single continent.If we all did that the world is saved. But I don\\'t need to worry about everyone . Just me. That\\'s what choosing myself is all about.And then I\\'m happier. Today. And start over tomorrow. It\\'s every day I have to do this.Just remember: Inner, Outer, Everybody.Money, sex, french toast, and passion are just byproducts of those three things. I threw out almost all of my items a few weeks ago. I didn\\'t want them anymore. They were anchoring me too much to the ground. But I kept one item. An original animation still from the theme song of the 70s TV show \"I Dream of Jeannie\".It\\'s right in front of me as I write this. Jeannie made all of Major Nelson\\'s dreams come true. He was an astronaut.I don\\'t know. But when I fake it til I make it, I\\'m an astronaut who lives in warm weather who has a genie that makes all my dreams come true. And then I get out of bed to begin the day. And then I hug someone for six seconds.(Photo by Ted Fu / You can subscribe to my podcast here)]',\n",
       "  53: '[I don\\'t know what to tell you about first. I had one company that failed on me this week. Really painfully, ugly puke-failed me. Or I can tell you about the other company that I sold this week. Selling a business is 90% personal and only 10% business. Maybe I can tell you about the company I\\'m about to start next week. I\\'m excited about it but starting a company is brutal. It\\'s a maze until you find the cheese at the end.Everything is a bit too fresh. I don\\'t know how I feel about them yet.All day yesterday I was on the phone and I had to switch from mindset to mindset. That\\'s hard on my brain. Sometimes I\\'d get on the phone to talk about the company I was starting but I was still feeling like someone had just shit in my mouth because I had just been talking to the company that was failing. Sometimes I\\'d be talking about the company I was selling and everything seemed so hopeful but then there would be a stumbling block in the deal and I\\'d have to figure out how to jump as high as possible to get over that stumbling block. Every deal in the world has stumbling blocks. That\\'s why 90% of companies fail. People don\\'t realize that there\\'s idea, execution, selling, and then... closing. Closing is often the hardest. It\\'s where everyone is deluded into thinking things are done, that the sky is all blue from here on out, but there\\'s still one more blizzard/tsunami to get through. I don\\'t know, it\\'s all too close. Later. Instead I want to talk about Tiger Woods. The other day I was thinking about the woman he was first caught having an affair with. Would she go on my podcast? But wait, that\\'s not what I want to talk about either. That\\'s gossip.A friend of mine went to a golf tournament that Tiger Woods was playing at. \"He did ok,\" my friend said. First off, that\\'s amazing to me. That even the best in the world is sometimes \"ok\". That must be frustrating to know you are better than everyone and yet most of the time you still rank at \"just ok\". Does Tiger Woods cry when he is just ok? I probably would.I know I would. It\\'s why I don\\'t play in chess tournaments anymore. I don\\'t want to be just ok. That\\'s why I\\'m not Tiger Woods. That and other things. \"But here\\'s the thing,\" my friend was telling me, \"after the tournament it was starting to get dark and for some reason I stood around to keep watching.\"Tiger Woods suddenly came back on the course when everyone was gone. He shot 250 long drives, one after the other.\"He had a coach with him. After each drive, the coach came up to him, talked to him, stepped back, and Tiger Woods hit another shot.\"250 times, one after the other, he didn\\'t take a break. And that\\'s after playing 18 holes in a tournament all day!\" That\\'s like what they say about Michael Jordan. When he was at the top of his game, his teammates would say, \"he was always the first at the court each day and the last to leave, practicing.\" I always wonder about the other pro players who said that about Jordan- why didn\\'t they show up early?They know that was the #1 key to Jordan\\'s success. Why didn\\'t they emulate it? Warren Buffett would drive 20 hours to the towns of public companies he felt were super-cheap. He\\'d put up signs on telephone poles, \"If you want to sell your shares call this number\" because he figured those towns would have plenty of shareholders. And that\\'s how he made his very first million dollars. He bought the cheap shares and rode them up through the 1950s.Or, I will tell you about someone not too many people know, Kay Cannon. She commuted to work each day on a subway in NYC. While on the subway she\\'d write another page in a screenplay. Three years later, one of the most successful teen movies ever, Pitch Perfect, was made. Her movie she wrote while commuting on the Subway. Now \"Pitch Perfect 2\" is about to come out. I\\'ve seen Pitch Perfect. It\\'s great. I highly recommend it. It\\'s a \"choose yourself\" sort of story written by a \"choose yourself\" woman.We all know this is the secret. Staying after the tournament with a coach and hitting 250 more balls. Or getting to the court before everyone else and staying until everyone leaves. Or writing every day on the subway. \"A little more every day\" adds up to....what? Being the best basketball player ever, being the best golf player ever, making your first million, having one of the top movies ever. Or maybe just having more fun doing what you love in the spare scraps of time we can all find in our lives. What else does it lead to?It leads to people paying you to do what you love.Think about it: Tiger Woods takes A STICK and hits a ball as far as possible. He gets paid $100 million a year to do that. I quit advising the bad company finally. I helped sell the company that I think will change the world. And I\\'m almost done launching the new company. But every day I like to write these posts. You read them. I love you.(Michael Jordan photo by Basket Streaming; Tiger Woods photo by Keith Allison)]',\n",
       "  54: '[The other day I went out at night and fell asleep on a park bench near the beach in Miami.When I opened my eyes I pretended I had just landed on the world. I knew nothing. Now I had to learn everything.That\\'s the way I should\\'ve been when I was younger. Maybe I would\\'ve avoided many problems if I just realized I knew nothing.ALL SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE started off knowing nothing.They studied the people who came before them. Who studied the people who came before them. And so on.I really admire Richard Branson. He\\'s one to study.Richard Branson is the perfect example of \"Ready. Fire. Aim.\" He starts something. He does it. Then he looks to see if he hit the target. If not, he starts something new.I love the story of how he started Virgin Airlines. He was already successful from Virgin Music. Note that now he has nothing to do with Virgin Music.I don\\'t even know if Virgin Music still exists. All that is left is Virgin Air.A plane had gotten cancelled. Everyone was upset.But Branson wasn\\'t upset. He found a plane that would take him. But he didn\\'t have the money.One good thing to start with always is to imagine the obstacles gone. Imagine, \"if I wasn\\'t worried about money, would I still make this trip?\"I call this IDEA SUBTRACTION. Subtract the perceived obstacles to an idea and (BAM!) you find that many more ideas are born from that.First, he arranged to rent the private plane, even though he still had the obstacle (\"no money\").Then he put up a sign: \"$29 for a plane to Puerto Rico.\" And everyone signed up. Suddenly he had the money for the plane.That was his proof-of-concept for an airline. Now that is his main business and it\\'s worth billions.Here\\'s ten quotes from him that I think are valuable.Listen more than you talk. Nobody learned anything by hearing themselves speak.Start making suggestions for how to improve your workplace. Dont be a shrinking violet, quietly getting your job done adequately. Be bold, and the sky is the limit.Note he\\'s not suggesting start a company. You can always create inside ANY surrounding and you will be infinitely rewarded for that.The first employee at Google is now a multi-billionaire even though nobody knows his name (Craig Silverstein). He was an employee and he created and blossomed.Age isn\\'t as important so long as you are surrounded by people you love, doing things you passionately believe in.I truly believe this. We all have things we love to do. And it\\'s the people around us who love us that help us unlock these dreams.It\\'s ONLY when you find the people you love, you can create and flourish. Henry Ford was 45 when he started his third car company and created the assembly line. He did this once he eliminated all the people who tried to control him at prior companies.Colonel Sanders was 65 when he started \"Kentucky Fried Chicken\".Laura Ingalls Wilder was 65 when she wrote her first book. The book that would turn into the series, \"Little House on the Prairie\".This was after she had been totally wiped out in the Great Depression and left with nothing but she started to surround herself with people who encouraged her and pushed her to pursue writing to make ends meet.What I personally know would make up a dot so minuscule it couldnt be seen. What humanity has collectively learned so far would make up a tiny mark within the circle. Everything we all have to learn in the future would take up the rest of the space. It is a big universe, and we are all learning more about it every day. If you arent listening, you are missing out.The other day someone asked me if I believed in \"God\". There\\'s no answer. Always have reverence for the infinite things we will never know. Our brains are too small.This next quote I slightly want to change:To be a real entrepreneur you always have to be looking forward. The moment you rest on your laurels is the moment your competition overtakes you.I think \\'entrepreneur\\' can be changed to \\'human\\'. We all have to survive and succeed first as humans. And the job description changes every day.Every day there is room to finish this sculpture that began the moment our mothers released us into the world.There is no such thing as a boring person: everyone has stories and insights worth sharing. While on the road, we let our phones or laptops take up our attention. By doing that, we might miss out on the chance to learn and absorb ideas and inspiration from an unexpected source: our fellow travelers.Every day has stories hidden inside of them, like a treasure hunt. When you find those stories, you get rewarded. Not by money, but by...I don\\'t know. Something. You feel it when it happens.It can be easy to find reasons not to do something. However you might be surprised by how much help is at hand if you put yourself out there and commit to a project. It doesnt have to be a case of struggling along by yourself.We live in a world of connection. The barriers we\\'ve erected by storytelling (religion, nationalism, corporatism) are breaking down.You can crowdsource a revolution with a single tweet now. There are a million ways to ask for help and a million people who want to help you.But it\\'s hard to ask. There\\'s the old fears of rejection. Fears of people viewing asking as weakness. Fears of infringing on someone by asking.Offer value in your ask and then the reasons to not do something start to go away until there are none left.And again, Branson is referring to \"idea subtraction\" which has constantly propelled him from success to success.When most people think about taking a risk they associate it with negative connotations, when really they should view it as a positive opportunity. Believe in yourself and back yourself to come out on top. Whether that means studying a course to enable a change of direction, taking up an entry level position on a career ladder you want to be a part of, or starting your own business  youll never know if you dont give it a try.Another example of how Branson would use \"idea subtraction\" to come up with tons of ideas.For instance, sometimes people say, \"If only I knew how to program I could do X\". Well, imagine you could program. Subtract that worry. Now what ideas would you implement?You can always subtract a worry. Whether it\\'s putting up a sign (\"$29 to get to Puerto Rico\") or, as Branson suggests above, taking an entry level position.When I started my first successful company my job title was, \"Jr. Programmer Analyst\" at HBO and I had $0 in the bank.I took an entry level job so I could move to NYC and start making connections. I stayed at that job for three years while building my network.For more than half of those three years I had my first company on the side, building up.I was afraid all the time I would get caught doing two jobs at the same time.But I did learn that these almost insurmountable obstacles were the EXACT reason I had huge opportunities.When people think a problem is impossible they value it at zero. Successful people buy ideas low (zero) and sell them high.You ask \"why can\\'t I?\" as in the following quote from Branson:Ive always had a soft spot for dreamers  not those who waste their time thinking what if but the ones who look to the sky and say why cant I shoot for the moon?Does he really mean the moon here? Or does that sound cliche? Let\\'s look.When Branson was a teenager and started his first magazine devoted to music, I doubt he was thinking about shooting for the moon.But who knows? Now his biggest investment is Virgin Galactic. That magazine (which he started despite severe dyslexia) literally turned into a company that is now shooting to land a ship on the moon.Why not? Why not?Together we can make the products, services, businesses, ideas, and politics for a better future. In this new power world, we are all makers. Lets get making.Sometimes people write me and say, \"not everyone is cut out to be an entrepreneur. Some people like being employees.\"I agree with this. There is nothing wrong with being an employee. It\\'s what you make of it.I\\'ve been an employee many times. The key is to realize that an \"employee\" doesn\\'t mean you give up on creating, on making, on coming up with ideas.In fact, an employee often has more opportunity for abundance than an entrepreneur. The playing field is much larger in a big corporation where everything is possible.I went to graduate school with Astro Teller, who was recently on my podcast. He runs the special projects division at Google called GoogleX. He\\'s an employee at Google.He was asked to \"dream\" at Google and now Google, a software company, is making driverless cars. It seems insurmountable: \"What if we can make a car without a driver?\" But that\\'s where the opportunity is.Every day I wake up and it\\'s a constant battle in my brain against obstacles. Usually not business obstacles but emotional ones. Fears. People. Ideas. Hopes. This is life. A stream of obstacles and fears in a tough world.I wish I had paid attention to the many wonderful virtual mentors, the Richard Bransons of the world, when I was younger.To simply admit, \"I don\\'t know\" and reap the benefits of curiosity.I hope I learn something today. If not I\\'ll go back and reread these quotes and maybe sleep on a park bench.(Photo by Dtiet)]',\n",
       "  55: '[Whoah! What just happened? I woke up the other day and I was 47 years old.I remember when I was seven years old. 40 YEARS AGO.I ran to the bathroom but I was too late. I peed all down my pants and everyone laughed and I had to sit in class wrapped in towels.Disgusting!They all made fun of me. \"No hard feelings,\" but all feelings are hard. It\\'s the hard feelings, good and bad, that we remember, that define the moments of our life. I was an amateur.Another time I was involved with a company where I didn\\'t realize one of the founders was a criminal. I figured, \"it\\'s because he\\'s crazy that I have this opportunity\" else who would give me an opportunity. Why me? I had no confidence. That was amateur hour.I was greedy. Greed breeds poverty. Saving the world breeds success. The second you think about the money, you stop being a pro. Here is what I think it takes to be a pro. Be simple, be humble, be curious, be fascinated, be passionate, have a vision. All of that is good as you rise from amateur to pro. But none of it will bring you to the other side. Where the dragon hides the gold. A) DON\\'T OWN THINGSI don\\'t mean, \"throw everything out\". Recently, Claudia and I did that. It\\'s not like it\\'s so great to do that. But suddenly, objects don\\'t have as much hold on us, holding us to the ground, to a place, to a memory, to a fantasy. I think it was Einstein who made the joke, \"if a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind then what does an empty desk mean?\"I\\'m fine with that. I\\'m fine with having an empty head. Leaves me weightless. Let\\'s me fly. B) NO POLITICSI was talking to Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, and he told me that he likes to write about topics where if you take either side, then both sides will hate you.For instance, pro-choice vs pro-life. If you can make a reasonable argument for both sides, then both sides will hate you.War vs \"No war has ever been justified\". I have lost friends over this one. If you can If you say, \"no war can ever be justified\" then almost every race and ethnicity will hate you.Global warming versus no global warming. Both sides will hate you if you argue a reasonable case for both sides.C) DROP BAD FRIENDSI kissed her even after she cheated. I shook his hand even after he stole. I cried because I cared about her after what she did. It\\'s hard to give up on people. But we\\'re each on our own path. The paths intersect but they never merge. Intersections are powerful explosions but some of them burn out. The pros know when to move on.D) LOOK SHARPSeems stupid but it\\'s true. Seems stupid coming from me, but it\\'s true. I once called Steve G when I was in tenth grade. On a scale of 1-10, I asked him, do you think any girl will ever like me?I had glasses, braces, acne, I never brushed my hair, and for some reason I liked to wear two button down shirts at the same time. Maybe to bulk up.He refused to answer. He said, \"maybe wait until college\". \"No hard feelings\". I don\\'t know if I ever improved. But looks also convey confidence, happiness, laughter, freedom. You want to look in the mirror and see freedom. E) A JOB IS A SMALL PLACESo many people fight for that last promotion. It\\'s like the last helicopter out of Vietnam. The jobs are going. But one leap and...Assistant VP of Sales while everyone else is left behind.Only... it\\'s a myth. You can\\'t get wealthy at a job. Everyone hates you. Your only friends are people you meet at a water fountain. And then there\\'s the next promotion...And then there\\'s entrepreneurship. Don\\'t be fooled by that myth either. 85% of businesses fail. And those are the ones started by pros. So how do people make money? By coming up with ten ideas a day. And out of 3,650 ideas a year, trying a few of them each year and never stopping. F) FIND WAYS TO LAUGHToday: Jim Gaffigan, Amy Schumer, and an episode of \"Episodes\" and a book by Kurt Vonnegut.Everyone who lives over the age of 100 says, \"I laugh a lot.\" I prefer that advice to the people who cry a lot and die young.My father cried a lot. He would call me while crying. He would cry in the super-market. He would cry at parent-teacher conferences. And he died young. I miss him. I would call him when everything was going wrong. His optimism was so creative and stupid. He always knew how to build me a fantasy path from the wreckage I was in, to a rainbow. I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t talk to you your last six months. But you always gave me a reason to believe in hope. Nothing wrong with crying. It\\'s just not as good a habit as laughing.G) BE CREATIVECreativity is double-edged. If you are creative for awhile and then stop, it feels very painful. Your brain feels constipated and it hurts. You can only be creative when everything is working right on all cylinders: physical emotional mental spiritual. If you are emotionally blocked, you\\'ll be creatively blocked. And so on. But when the spigot turns on the whole world is filled with art. This is how you sharpen the knife. The world becomes soft clay. You cut into it. H) NEW PEOPLEA week ago I spent the day on the set of a new TV show being filmed. I learned from the director, the writers, the actors, the extras, the assistants. How did I get there? Because of a friend of a friend of a friend. I forget how I even met the first friend. I just kept pursuing new people, and then their friends, and so on. I watched how the director set the tone of the entire show by how he shot the scene. I felt like a little boy with a new toy. I was giddy. I watched for seven straight hours the director filming the same scene over and over. I\\'m 47 and that was a brand new experience. Today I\\'ve already had one brand new experience. It was actually a horrible one. And I expect tomorrow I will have another one. Maybe it will be better. But it will be new. I) BE A CLOSERPeople think \"Closing\" is the same as \"Selling\". It\\'s not. That\\'s amateur hour. When you sell an idea, a product, a concept, a company, then the work truly begins. Then you go from selling to closing. A totally different skill. You have to hold hands every step of the way. You still have to keep the big mutual vision alive. You have to keep everyone hungry.And you also have to handle all the tiny dotted \"i\"s and crossed \"t\"s. You have to be big picture and microscopic picture.Amateurs do one or the other and are blind to the other side. They don\\'t even see it exists. Pros do both.I think after 20 years of trying to learn to do this I\\'m probably a \"6\" on a scale of 1-10 although every day I\\'m shown more areas where I\\'m an amateur. J) NEGOTIATION IS A MYTHMost people have no clue what negotiation is. It\\'s not about getting more money, or a higher percentage, or extra perks.Negotiation is the art of making both sides equally happy (\"1+1 = 5!\") and equally nervous (\"there\\'s a lot of work left to do. This is just the beginning!\").When you negotiate with only one side in mind (\"I want to be happier than the other side\") then both sides will lose. A pro is a good negotiator.K) ABH. Always be HonestOne time I pretended to be nice to an entrepreneur I didn\\'t like - Josh J. I told Mark K I didn\\'t like Josh.Then I had to go to dinner with Josh but he had already spoke to Mark.So that was awkward. He brought it right up and was smiling. Laughing at me. \"No hard feelings.\" When you lie, here\\'s what happens:a. everyone finds out anyway and you\\'re the fool in the middle.b. your life splits in two and it\\'s hard to keep trackI used to live a triple-life. Women, jobs, drugs. Much easier to suck the drama out of the outside world and put that creativity into your inner world. Then the seeds blossom.I) DON\\'T BELIEVE IN STORIESKim Kardashian is famous because 70,000 years ago we needed to commit genocide on Neanderthals.Humans were moving from Africa to Europe in bigger tribes than ever and there was no way we could know everyone in the tribe.So gossip was invented. \"Mark says Jack is a good hunter so since I trust Mark, I now trust Jack\".That\\'s the invention of gossip. 70,000 years later...Kim Kardashian.But when tribes got bigger than 150 we needed something bigger: storytelling.If you and I believe in the same story, then we are more likely to trust each other. Religion, nationalism, corporatism (\"Go IBM!\"), and even rooting for the same team, make us more likely to trust each other. They are all stories. Almost everything is a story. But we\\'re still learning that. It\\'s only been about 30,000 years of storytelling and 3 million years of being a species.So an evolutionary blip. And when storytelling breaks down, wars result. The trust breaks down. Better to understand from the beginning that everything is a story. Live the real life and not the story life. The only real story is being around people you love. Helping them with their dreams. Pros help others. Pros make the team better. Pros score the points.I\\'m mostly an amateur. There\\'s nothing wrong with that either. There\\'s too many things to be good at to be good at all of them.I\\'m still learning. I hope. I no longer pee in my pants as much. I learned how to wait and be patient. But I\\'m always going to miss my dad. The best amateur I ever knew.(Photo by Jeremy Brooks)]',\n",
       "  56: '[My next client had a guy who asked me for 20% of every deal his company would throw me. He was the decision-maker and I had employees to pay.I agreed to pay him 20%. He was now the third client that I had agreed to pay 20% to in order to throw me their business.I woke up almost every night at 2 or 3 in the morning thinking how many more weeks of payroll I had in the bank. Usually it was about six. \"\"I\\'ll figure it out after that\" I always told myself but I never fell back to sleep. Once a week I went out at night at three in the morning to interview prostitutes for one of my clients, HBO. One time we wired up a prostitute to hear what was going on when she got into a car with a guy. We never put that on the website. Nobody ever writes the classic text: \\'everything I know about business I learned from prostitutes\\'. Here\\'s some things said to me that I would use in that book: \\n\"They don\\'t pay us to have sex with us. They pay us so we leave afterwards\". #outsourcing\\n\"Clients feel in control all the time. They\\'re usually CEOs or millionaires and they are used to being in control. So they like it when we take control. It gives them relief.\" This is called, \"setting boundaries\"\\n\"My boyfriend doesn\\'t know I do this. I bought him a boat and he doesn\\'t ask questions.\" #briberty and #denial\\n\"If you get the money up front you can often get the client to talk a lot and then leave before doing anything because you can say someone is after you and you have to go.\" #entrepreneurship\\n\"I\\'m normally a party planner.\" #truth\\n\"I\\'m sick from cancer and don\\'t have insurance so this is how I pay my bills.\" #life\\n\"I was abused by the system ever since I was thrown in detention when I was 13 years old.\" #storytelling\\n\"I like it\" #lying\\nI don\\'t think one prostitute ever told me the truth but that\\'s ok. I just needed the interviews. I didn\\'t want to be a business guy. I wanted to entertain. Everyone else could decide if it was truth or not.Not to be deep but two things:A) what is truth really? andB) when people say \"we\\'re all prostitutes to some extent\" they have no idea what the are talking about.That said, we\\'re all prostitutes to some extent. One month we realized we had been forgetting to pay the insurance company. None of our employees were medically insured which I guess was against the law. I had no idea. We didn\\'t know whether or not to tell them. Or maybe something like, \"don\\'t get pregnant this month\". Ultimately, we didn\\'t say anything. Nobody got sick for the next three weeks and we started paying their insurance. We came close to hiring one guy to be a \"COO\" of the company. But he always wanted more. We would agree and then he\\'d ask for one more thing. More and more and more. Ultimately we ignored him. FACT: Negotiating ability is the most USELESS skill in the field of negotiating. The key is to get the deal. THEN work your way up. You can\\'t negotiate a door to be open. But when your foot is in the door you can always wiggle the door wider. I just heard what happened to that guy. He was cheating on his wife constantly. He lost his family and he got disbarred and now he lives (cliche but true) in a dirty hotel room. He over-negotiated his life away. #typicalOne client was always depressed. Everytime I talked to him he said, \"I wish I were dead\". I would laugh. His father died and left him $85 million. I never got lucky. One time my father wanted to help out and come to work. He hadn\\'t worked in years since going on disability for mental illness. He came into the office. My sister refused to show up. They didn\\'t get along. Every client who visited me for lunch I would always announce to everyone, \"I don\\'t want any interruptions because this is the most important person I\\'ve ever had lunch with.\" Another client told me, \"if Adrian calls my secretary one more F-ing time asking for money I\\'m going to beat the S out of him.\" He never paid his bill ever but that night we went out with the head of Interscope Records who introduced me to all the prostitutes sitting at his table. I also met Roseanne Arquette that night but that\\'s another story. Two months later I sold the company and a year later I quit. The guy who acquired my company tried to stop me from quitting. He said, \"this is the one time where slavery still applies.\" Then I started another company that cost Yasser Arafat $2 million. Among the many other things that were lost that year.(Photo by Wally Gobetz)]',\n",
       "  57: '[I thought I was done with the hard work of being a human being. I sold my first company for $15 million.Phew! That was hard. I thought after that that I was done. Time to drink and do everything else that is bad.Done!Got a few people pregnant. Lost all my money. Lost my home. Done!This happened to me a few times. I sold a company in 1998. I sold a company in 2004. I sold a company in 2008. Wasn\\'t this my goal in life?Each time, I felt like I no longer needed to keep up the facade of being healthy. I was now a success. No longer did I need to work for success. I WAS success.But then...bad. And once-friendly faces would stick out:\"I knew it!\" or \"I told you so!\" or just \"I hate you and will make you punish!\"People will not hesitate to punish you.So many people on their own layers of hell, eager to see someone fall past them so they know, beyond certainty, that there are hells deeper than the one they find themselves in.So what then, is success. Because it is not money. And it is not some physical achievement. It\\'s not a book written, or a reward received or a job completed or a promotion anointed.Here are the stages of success that I think exist. I can easily be wrong. This is what works for me now.Success has no definition. It\\'s a myth. No microscope can dissect it.Stages of fake success: GOAL. You\\'ve created something of so much value to the masses that the value gets reflected back to you.People look up to you. Money is showered down. This feels like success. It really does feel real good. Like super-cocaine. Success crack.But, one might say, donuts can be perceived as creating value for the many. So many people might get pleasure from your donuts that your \"success\" knows no bounds.In the long run donuts make you sick.So this definition might be suspect. HAPPY. You\\'re happy with spouse, job, place, your private creative achievements.You wake up and the birds sing. You\\'re happy.But we all know we age. People die. Creativity always carries on its back the weight of the criticisms all too eager to pile on. So this success is fleeting and hence suspect. HEALTHY. I always advocate a daily practice: every day attempt to improve just 1% along physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual pillars.But I\\'m afraid. Something can always go wrong.What can go wrong to the people I love today? What anonymous strangers will reach out and attempt to strangle me today?I get almost every day letters from someone who promises to get me for implanting a chip in his brain and controlling him with secret technology.Is it success if we are physically emotionally mentally spiritually healthy? If we improve those areas by 1% each day?I think that\\'s closer. But I still don\\'t know. What\\'s wrong with \"no improvement\". Why do we put the guns to our heads to improve?Such pressure! PRESENCE. Most of my life I time travel.I\\'ve spent much time in the future analyzing the possible alternatives and being afraid of everything bad about to happen.I\\'ve also spent valuable hours in the past, replaying, rewriting, regretting.\"But you have to focus on tomorrow,\" people say, \"so today you can best prepare for it.\"I\\'m staying in a house right now where the owner has a cute pad of \"Lists\" - every day she writes her to-do, grocery, bucket, life, etc lists.But no matter how many items are on our list, we can only do one thing at a time. The rest is just possibility.I can worry about fifteen things, but worrying will only weaken my energy for today, and do nothing to solve the problems of tomorrow. No matter what those problems are. FREEDOM. Some of us are in prison. Some of us are in man-made prisons, Every excuse is a brick or a chain.\"It\\'s too late.\" \"I have no time\" \"I have no education\" \"I have no connections\" etc.Some of us are in self-imposed prisons, \"if I don\\'t do THIS then I\\'ve FAILED\".We\\'re the only jailers of these prisons. The doors are always open.We open the doors by lowering our expectations. We walk out the doors when we realize how easy it is to exceed those expectations.In a universe filled with a trillion galaxies and a trillion more years, there is no anointed goal that, when accomplished, will cause you to shout, \"Success!\"Doing the best we can this moment is success. It brings about all the other stages of success described above.The only way to have a successful tomorrow, and a successful life, and a successful legacy, is having a successful moment right now.I can\\'t claim to do it. I try and usually I fail. Success is not meant to be every second. Else, how would you know what to compare it to.Be gentle to yourself. You\\'re a little baby and someone needs to cradle you and whisper to you and love you.My daughter just published a story on fanfiction.net. It\\'s anonymous because she doesn\\'t give a shit. She\\'s bragging. It has 2000 words. F@#$ you, little girl.(Photo by Nila Sivatheesan)]',\n",
       "  58: '[Many people have said to me in the past few months, Im going to buy a home. Or, What do you think of the idea of me buying a home?

I bought a home once after I sold a business. I then lost that home. I then went almost completely insane trying to sell it. Two things: If you are about to do a startup or if you are in the middle of startup-phase then you definitely cant afford to waste the time or money to buy a house for reasons I explain below. Second, when you sell your startup  everyone wants to buy a house with the proceeds. Dont. Its just part of the American mythology. You know the myth: the white picket fence, the yard, the pool, the walls that you can paint, the keeping up with the Jones family. Just dont. Youll go broke. At least, if you are as stupid as me. I might be dumber than most though.The other story I have of owning a home is still too personal. Its filled with about as much pain as I can fit onto a page. Oh, I have a third one also from when I was growing up. But I dont want to upset anyone in my family so Ill leave it out. Oh, I have a fourth story that I just forgot about until this very second. But enough about me. Lets get right to it.There are many reasons to not buy a home: Financial:A) Cash Gone. You have to write a big fat check for a down payment. But its an investment, you might say to me. Historically this isnt true. According to Robert Shiller from Yale, in Irrational Exuberance, 2nd edition, inflation-adjusted housing returned 0.4% from 1890  2004. And thats just housing prices. It forgets all the other stuff Im going to mention below. Suffice to say, when you write that check, youre never going to see that money again. Because even when you sell the house later youre just going to take that money and put it into another down payment. So if you buy a $400,000 home, just say goodbye to $100,000 that you worked hard for. You can put a little sign on the front lawn: $100,000 R.I.P.Much better for an entrepreneur is to invest in yourself. Take 1/20th of the down payment amount. Start a business. Your investment might go to zero (which it might also do with a house) but it might also go up 10,000%. Eventually, as an entrepreneur, if you are persistent enough, you will get one of those 10,000% returns. And you will be able to be persistent because you didnt waste all the money and time that a house wouldve cost you.B) Closing costs. I forget what they were the last two times I bought a house. But it was about another 2-3% out the window. Lawyers, title insurance, moving costs, antidepressant medicine, therapy. It adds up. Two- to three-percent. Do you like flushing your money down the toilet? But, people say: isnt that what you are doing with rent money? Absolutely not. See below.C) Maintenance. No matter what, youre going to fix things. Lots of things. In the lifespan of your house, everything is going to break. Thrice. Get down on your hands and knees and fix it! And then open up your checkbook again. Spend some more money. I rent. My dishwasher doesnt work. I call the landlord and he fixes it. Or I buy a new one and deduct it from my rent. And some guy from Sears comes and installs it. I do nothing. The Sears damage repair and my landlord work for me.When you are an entrepreneur, two things: A) you need every last dime for your business. Not for your dishwasher. And B) you need every last second for your business. Not for your dishwasher.D) Taxes. Theres this myth that you can deduct mortgage payment interest from your taxes. Whatever. Thats a microscopic dot on your tax returns. And guess what, that whole thing about how rent will go up with inflation? Well your property taxes will go up even faster than inflation. So you lose.E) Youre trapped. Lets spell out very clearly why the myth of home ownership became religion in the United States. Its because corporations didnt want their employees to have many job choices. So they encouraged them to own homes. So they cant move away and get new jobs. Job salaries is a function of supply and demand. If you cant move, then your supply of jobs is low. You cant argue the reverse, since new adults are always competing with you. Thats one reason for the myth. The other reason is that we have a 15 trillion dollar mortgage industry. Thats a lot of money vested on you believing that owning a home is the right thing to do.And, the benefits of being an entrepreneur is that all choices are open to you. Mobility is not just an option, its often a necessity. You arent tied down to one factory. The world is your opportunity.F) Ugly. Saying my house is an investment forgets the fact that a house has all the qualities of the ugliest type of investment: 1. Illiquidity. You cant cash out whenever you want. 2. High leverage. You have to borrow a lot of money in most cases. 3. No diversification. For most people, a house is by far the largest part of their portfolio and greatly exceeds the 10% of net worth that any other investment should be.Investing in yourself is also illiquid. But it involves less money, and allows you more choice. So do that instead.Personal reasons to not own a house:A) Trapped, part 2. Some people like to have roots. But I like things to change every once in a while. Starting March, 2009 I was renting an apartment directly across the street from the New York Stock Exchange. It was fun. Id look out the window and see Wall Street. How exciting! Before that I lived in The Chelsea Hotel with Chubb Rock. Last year we decided to relax and move a little north. Now I look out the window and see the Hudson River. And its quiet and I can walk along the river in the morning with no noise. It took us two weeks to pick a place and move. No hassles. I like to live a hassle-free life.Im constantly involved in other activities that I care about and love. What do I want the hassle of owning a home for? What if, god forbid, I want to focus on my next start-up?B) Walls. You cant change the walls when you rent. A lot of people seem to want to tear down walls. Or paint them. Sometimes when you rent you cant do these things. Well, make sure you have a landlord that lets you tear down walls. There must be some ancient evolutionary tic that makes us want to tear down walls or put nails in them or paint them. I dont get it. I like the walls to stay right where they are.C) Rent. People will argue that the price of the mortgage, maintenance taxes, etc is all baked into the price of rent. Sometimes this is true. But usually not. And often maintenance and taxes will go up faster than your rent.D) Psychology. Look at your personal reasons for wanting to own. Do you feel like you cant accomplish something in life until you own a house? Do you feel like its part of getting married and Settling down, i.e. creating a nest for your future children? For you, is it a part of becoming an adult. Is this what your parents taught you? Examine the real reasons you want to own and make sure they are coming from a good spot in your heart.E) Your time. Do you really want to spend all that time working on your house? Is this where your time is best spent towards creating a happy and fulfilled life for yourself?F) Choices. I feel when I rent I always have the choice to leave. To live wherever in the world I want whenever I want. Adventure becomes a possibility even if I never take advantage of it.G) Stress. For me (not for everyone) owning a home equals stress. I saw what my parents went through at their worst moments owning a home. I saw what I and others went through in the Internet bust when I first owned a home. I saw what people went through in 2008. People were killing themselves. I dont like that sort of stress. This is how I deal with stress. H) Cash is king. I like cash in the bank. I like having access to it. I dont like it all tied up in one illiquid investment. I want to fill a bathtub with all the dollar bills I wouldve used as a down payment on a house. I want to bathe in that bathtub. Im going to do that later today in fact.By the way, this is going to sound like a contradiction: but I think housing is a great investment right now. I think housing prices have gone down far enough and I can list the reasons why housing as an abstract investment concept is going to go higher from here. Suffice to say there are many stocks/REITs you can buy, with leverage if you want to take advantage of the rise in housing. But those are liquid investments. You can get your money back.Theres also probably many companies you can build where you will get 10,000% returns where you can take advantage of the rise in housing that is about to occur.But Im never going to buy a home again. And sit there in the middle of the night thinking, Why the hell did I do this to myself again?(Photo by Esteban Manchado)]',\n",
       "  59: '[A few years before he wrote Freakonomics, Stephen Dubner wanted to follow me around. To shadow me so he can find out how depraved I was.\"I\\'m writing a book about the Psychology of Money. You\\'re going to be the first chapter.\" He wanted to write about someone who made and lost millions and psychologically was a total wreck.He came to my \"house-colding\" party. I was losing my house in NYC and about to move 80 miles north to the only place I could afford. A house 1/3 the size. We were all depressed at the party. Well, my ex-wife said, this is it, as the elevator opened for the last time. My oldest daughter was crying. The house was empty. Stephen was writing in his notebook.Then he came and visited me upstate a few weeks later in our broken down house at the time. We started playing Backgammon. We began a match in 2002 that is still ongoing. It\\'s a match of matches. We play to a 100 each match. I think the score is 2-1 in my favor but he\\'s about to make it 2-2.He stopped writing on this book because his article about an economist in Chicago got very popular and he got a book deal because of it.The day before Freakonomics came out, Stephen was depressed. \"I don\\'t know what I\\'ll do if this book doesn\\'t work out,\" he told me while we were playing.\"Don\\'t worry,\" I said, \"it will be a bestseller.\" I had read a copy. I had no idea if it would be a bestseller or not. I was just being nice.A few days later he calls me up. \"Look at the Amazon number.\"Holy S&amp;&amp;&amp;! It was #2. #1 was a Harry Potter book. For the next year or so or three, Freakonomics was #2 or #1. Going back and forth.I don\\'t think there\\'s been a non-fiction book like that since. So consistently in the top 2. After that it was a franchise: two more books, a game, a movie, a blog, a radio show, a podcast.I\\'ve read and re-read all the books. But I\\'ve probably read the first book over ten times. I think I know why it\\'s a success. And I think the two reasons why it\\'s a success can be applied to business, relationships, writing, all creativity. Everything.#1: AHA!There\\'s an example in the second book of how monkeys learned how to use cash to pay for sex. The first case of animal prostitution?That\\'s an AHA! It\\'s not enough to say \"monkeys learned how to trade\". This would be interesting, but not ten times as interesting as any other fact about monkeys. But sex and monkeys and prostitution is ten times as interesting. It\\'s an AHA!In the first book, they break down the economics of a crack gang and explain why so many crack dealers live at home with their mothers.This is an AHA! It\\'s not like saying \"Crack dealers end up in jail more than other types of drug dealers\".What is an AHA! moment?It\\'s saying or doing something that is ten times more than expected. As an example, Daniel Kahnemann has written that after someone makes $75,000 then their happiness starts to even out if they make more than $75,000.A non-AHA moment would be, \"that\\'s not true. It depends on where they live.\" That might be a smarter way to put it but it would not be AHA!AHA! might be that after $1,000,000 a year people become more and more miserable. And that $10,000,000 a year they become suicidal.I\\'m not saying that is true. Who knows? I\\'m just saying that\\'s a ten-time addition to the original statement.In business, you can\\'t offer a \"cheap Uber\". That\\'s a small improvement over Uber. Who cares? What would be interesting is if Uber can pick up my laundry and groceries and even my prescriptions at the pharmacy. That\\'s an AHA!I went to Best Buy to get a new phone this year. The upgrades were so meaningless that for the first time in ten years I didn\\'t get a new phone. No AHA! But if they told me, \"the battery life lasts for two weeks instead of one day\" I would\\'ve paid any amount of money.In relationships you can\\'t be slightly more handsome or interesting than her last boyfriend. They broke up for a reason!You have to show where you are 10 times better. If the last guy never returned her calls, then you can write love letters AND return calls. AHA!As Steve Martin once said when his career was taking off, \"be so good they can\\'t ignore you.\"In anything you want to be good at, go for the AHA!, not the HO-HUM.#2: Secret OriginsMy favorite comic book as a kid was a DC comic called, \"Secret Origins\". Each issue was the secret origin of a different superhero.It\\'s not enough to know that Batman is a good detective and is rich. It\\'s important to know that his parents were killed right in front of him.He\\'s probably psychologically disturbed and constantly seeking revenge so he wears a skintight suit and gets pleasure beating people up.In Freakonomics, they don\\'t just present a bunch of bland research. For every scientist whose research they discuss, they first get right to the heart of what the scientist\\'s personal story is:why was he interested in monkeys who pay for sex? Why is he interested in the amount of methane gas that cows give off. Why is he interested in the IQs of people who spell their names wrong?What was Stephen\\'s secret origin? When he was nine years old singing in a Catholic church choir with his religious parents, his dad collapsed of a heart attack and died.Then he realized his parents had converted from Judaism and he started exploring this new religion for him - perhaps an abstract quest for the parent he lost.The book that resulted, \"Turbulent Souls\" became a bestseller.When Stephen was following me around, he called all my relatives and people I had worked with to find out who he was following, but from their perspective.If something (a business, a relationship, a book, a character) is important to you, find out who they are. Don\\'t ask them WHAT their work is. Ask them WHY their work is. Ask them WHO their work is. Ask others about them.Find where they are most disturbed because that fissure in the surface is where the earthquakes will come from.---Every single one of us, without a single exception, has gone through a period of enormous stress and sadness in our lives. This is the knife that shapes our futures.Without understanding these moments, we miss the entire picture, we miss the subtleties of the work of art that each one of us uniquely is.Look around at the people in your life. At the friends and family, but also the people you encounter.An archaeologist doesn\\'t dig with a shovel. He digs with a spoon, extracting tiny pieces of dirt and artifacts that might represent centuries of lives and loves over millimeters of dirt extracted.An archaeological dig can take years. So can a friendship. So can a love. So can a business or a work of art. The secret origins of the people all around you are like these archaeological digs.Dig far enough and you\\'ll hit oil that will energize the relationship forever.---When Stephen finished Freakonomics, he sent me the first chapter about \"The Psychology of Money\" which he decided never to write. The chapter about me.\"The [well known] Magazine might want to make this the cover story,\" he said to me. Would you mind?I read it and some other members of my family read it and they didn\\'t like what he said and I had to tell him no.Instead I have his invaluable friendship, so I am the net winner. And I get to crush him in Backgammon.Everyone has an AHA! in them. And everyone has a secret origin.When I look at you, Claudia, every day I try to AHA! you. I keep trying to learn more of your secret origin. And the more I find, the more I love you.(Photo by himmelskratzer)]',\n",
       "  60: '[Giving a talk is the worst thing you can do to your body. First off, you want to pee, crap, and puke right before you go on stage. In other words, your body thinks it\\'s about to die.Second, I convince myself I\\'m totally worthless as a human being so I start crying and Claudia has to find me and convince me I\\'m wrong.So that\\'s when I break out the only method that ever works for me. All the time, every day, I\\'m either laughing or crying. I prefer laughter.Even the women I\\'ve been most attracted to always made me laugh. One woman from 20 years ago constantly insulted me but the insults were so quick and funny I couldn\\'t help being attracted to her.But she was a mean person to everyone and somehow people could just tell. One time we were just walking in the street and a homeless guy walked right up to her and spat in her face.\"Holy shit!\" she said, \"go after him!\". But there was no chance that was happening and she broke up with me.I\\'ve already written that before I give a talk I listen to standup comedy.James Science: it triggers the mirror neurons in my brain and helps me to relax, and maybe mimic how they work their voices and bodies, and helps me to connect better with the audience.Several people have asked me about my just-released TED talk (found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmndCPvXiik) and what comedy I watched. I\\'ll share it right here.Most comedians are absurd. Not absurd in the sense that everything they say is ridiculous.Here\\'s the trick: they take you to this point we can all emotionally relate to. And then, BAM!, they blow it to smithereens. Once you can relate to them, you\\'re along for the ride.So this is exactly what I listened to over and over again before giving the talk.Andy Samberg\\'s Harvard commencement speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_K-UIREYAI don\\'t think he makes sense for even one second during the entire speech. Which means he totally goes for it. He\\'s committed to the end to stay in character no matter how confused the audience is.It\\'s hard to be that committed when you have no idea what people are thinking.Bo Burnham\\'s \"what.\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejc5zic4q2AI have to admit, the above clip makes me jealous when I watch it. I wish when was in my 20s I had had 1/10 the talent Bo has.The whole clip is good but the last ten minutes I was like (starting at 52:40): Oh my god, how did he come up with that?116 videos of Amy Schumer doing standup. She might be the funniest person alive: http://youtu.be/ejc5zic4q2AMarina Franklin doing standup.She has this beautiful innocence about her. And then BAM! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaFvb46BUH8Plus, you can find her on my podcast.There\\'s so much good Louis CK stuff that I can\\'t pick. Just watch anything Louis CK.Here\\'s a recent SNL monologue he did: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VnAKGFo-rMAnthony Jeselnik: I like how he connects with the audience just when you think they should be hating him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoorEIjAx0IDaniel Tosh. Daniel Tosh is the reason I stopped using powerpoints in my talks.Because you can compare how funny he is between his standup and his show Tosh.0 where he has youtube videos as props. He\\'s about 1/10 as funny in the show.I then read later that powerpoints use a different part of the brain and that using them in a talk forces the brain to over-work so people can\\'t focus on your talk as well.Anyway, here\\'s Tosh doing standup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjCAE5c2mdcI just finished reading \"Food\" by Jim Gaffigan. I begged his managers or whoever to see if he could come on my podcast. They said \"no\". That\\'s ok. Louis CK said \"no\" also. And Jim is up there with Louis CK for excellent standup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZxqLQUkozkJimmy Fallon is changing late-night TV. There\\'s no way I can keep up with that sort of energy. But I love his SNL audition reel and the sheer talent he shows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H39EOWMw1TAAnd then it\\'s hard to believe that a clip from C-Span makes the list but I love how Seth Rogen injects humor into an incredibly serious issue in a congressional hearing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHqx3-mfHAYI also read funny: Kurt Vonnegut, Simon Rich, Tina Fey, Douglas Adams, Miranda July.I will tell you what did not work: watching a ton of TED videos, which I did. It just scared me. They were all so professional. And reading all the books about how to talk at a TED talk. I know what works for me and what doesn\\'t. This is what works for me. When I hear people laugh, it makes me feel good. It was like I was attracted to the whole audience. I loved them. And I wanted them to love me back. I lasted 12 minutes.(Here is the link to my TEDx San Diego talk)]',\n",
       "  61: '[Last night, about two feet from me they were having sex. I know this because, using the scientific method, I cupped a glass against the wall, put my ear against it, and listened.I moved the glass around the wall until the sound was the most clear.One question: we spend $800 billion on killing children in Iraq but we can\\'t figure out how to bottle the sound a woman makes when my glass is against the wall of her room.A man sounds like a grunting animal. I don\\'t know if this is sexist, but a woman is music.They woke me up, but it\\'s ok. They are always welcome to do that. I\\'m in an AirBnB and today is my last day. I like listening to music.Music shows that after all the hard work of living, there is some time and energy for a little pleasure to be enjoyed.---Many years ago I got this guy\\'s password, logged into his email and totally F-ed S up inside there. That would keep him busy.He had been harassing people on a website I started. How should I describe \"harass\"?With women, he was sending sexual messages and they were logging out. With men he was just arguing with them all the time and they also were logging out of my service.I had written to him first. I said, \"I\\'m trying to build something to support my family. Please back off.\"And he wrote back and said, \"No. Free speech.\"I was storing everyone\\'s password who ever logged into the site so I looked up his. I decided to check and see if he used the same password for his email.He did.I logged into his account and read all of his emails. He had a few girlfriends. They didn\\'t know about each other. He had problems with his father, who was the CEO of a big company. They don\\'t speak anymore but \"one day I\\'m going to get that money\".Money is often a way to pay people to hate you.After I took care of \"business\" he stopped logging into my site for awhile. He had to spend a long time fixing things.Was this good or bad or against the law? I have no idea. But my site continued to run and help a lot of people. And I fed my family.I forgot about the whole thing.Many years later I saw in the news that he had confessed to killing and burying someone in 1992. It was a friend of his. They were teenagers and he had hit his friend with a rock in the head during a disagreement. Then he buried his friend.The crime had remained unsolved. But, as he said in court, he felt so guilty about it 20 years later he had to confess.Crime solved.Sometimes people are just \"off\". Now ... 20 years ago ... 20 years from now. You can\\'t let these people stop you from feeding your family.Claudia said, \"don\\'t write this\" because maybe this guy will get out of jail and track me down.---Here\\'s 7 pieces of BAD advice about starting businesses: let\\'s call them MYTHS- Myth #1: Focus on one thing.The average multi-millionaire has at least seven different sources of income. You can\\'t have seven full time jobs. A \"source of income\" takes up much less time than a boss paying you to sit in a chair.So, do the opposite of focus. Try to help people in many different ways. Then many different types of payment will come your way.Be patient with yourself while this is happening. The path to calm starts with being gentle to yourself.- Myth #2: Get a lawyer and an accountant.You don\\'t need those until you have ideas, customers, partners, money coming in. Once I started a company, built it up, and didn\\'t hire a lawyer until the week before I sold the company.- Myth #3: Don\\'t try more than one business at a time (I guess this is \"focus\" but I\\'m not very focused). Try many ideas at the same time. And if you say, \"but I don\\'t have time\" then take a step back and ask where you are being inefficient. Being an \"entrepreneur\" is a glorified version of this myth. Forget the word \"entrepreneur\". Instead, help people succeed at their businesses, make many connections, do many things, and see what brings in money.I haven\\'t been an entrepreneur since 2008 and I\\'ve had more financial success than ever. (I hate to say a good thing. Usually I write about bad things. But sometimes good things are ok).- Myth #4: Develop a product.Too many people have an idea for a product and assume the customer will be there. This never happens. Ever.Google, Facebook, Twitter, Groupon, Instagram, are all examples of companies that pivoted massively from their initial products.First get a customer, then develop the product they need. It might just be a service. Or even better, it might just be an introduction. Or advice. Or something we haven\\'t thought of yet.- Myth #5: Hire a secretary. Hire anyone.This becomes a fixed cost. Fixed costs are stresses. Why add to the stresses in life?Delegate but don\\'t hire.- IMPORTANT MYTH #6: Under-promise and over deliver.People can tell when you are under-promising (i.e. lying). Don\\'t do that.Better to over-promise and over-deliver. Then you beat out all the people who under-promised and over-delivered.Over-promise to get the sale. Over-deliver to keep the customer for life.This might seem hard. It is. It\\'s really hard. Just do it.- Oh. MORE IMPORTANT: MYTH #7: Have a personal brand.\"Personal brands\" have been the latest fashion. \"Branding\" used to be ok with corporations. A Coca-Cola bottle really does have sexy curves. That\\'s a brand.Real branding is when a farmer buys a cow.He then puts an iron rod in fire until the metal shape at the end of the iron rod is orange hot. He then sticks it onto the side of the cow while the cow is chained down until the metal shape is permanently in the side of the cow.Everyone seems so eager to brand themselves. Instead, here\\'s a better idea: You be the iron rod. Get red hot. Leave your mark on the planet.---You can tell if something is luck if it\\'s equally hard to lose as it is to win.Business is not luck. It\\'s very easy to lose. It\\'s pretty hard to win. If you avoid the above myths, you increase your chances.Winning is not about making money for luxuries.You simply want to purchase your freedom from the regimented society all too eager to stick a hot iron rod into your side.---Maybe I should\\'ve just taken one of these topics and made a smaller post. But the brain doesn\\'t work that way.And I was thinking about the room next door last night. Eventually I couldn\\'t hear anything anymore. I put the glass down and went to sleep.But here\\'s what\\'s amazing: maybe I listened to a baby being made last night.(Photo by Alan Strakey)]',\n",
       "  62: '[I thought I was done with the hard work of being a human being. I sold my first company for $15 million, and I knew I was finished with all the hard work. I had achieved a goal.But goals are man-made. And in one lifetime we will have many goals. And our small brains have never developed the capacity to understand what goals are in our own best interests.Imagine someone slapping their hands to clean off the dust of hard work digging in the fields all day. \"All done!\" as he claps his hands and waits for the sun to set so he could enjoy the festivities.Dancing maybe. Or drinking. Whatever. Done!Success dresses up for Halloween and pretends to be that moment. That moment when you\\'ve accomplished your BIG thing and you think that\\'s all there was to it, this sojourn here on the planet  finishing the big thing and saying, Done! I did my job as a human.This happened to me a few times. I sold a company in 1998. I sold a company in 2004. I sold a company in 2008. Wasn\\'t this my goal in life?Each time, I felt like I no longer needed to keep up the facade of being healthy. I was now a success. No longer did I need to work for success. I WAS success. The living embodiment of it.But within months, or sometimes even seconds, of giving up on that slippery grasp we all hold on to called \"Improvement\" I would fall Fall FALL. Down through the inferno and each layer seeing the faces laughing, \"I knew it!\" or \"I told you so!\" or just \"I hate you and will make you punish!\"People will not hesitate to punish you.So many people on their own layers of hell, eager to see someone fall past them so they know, beyond certainty, that there are hells deeper than the one they find themselves in.Success is a cheap god that gives you pleasure for a second before sticking the knives in and throwing you out of heaven.So what, then, is success? Because it is not money. That I know. And it is not some physical achievement. That I know. It is not a book written or a reward received or a job completed or a promotion anointed.Here are the stages of success that I think exist. I can easily be wrong. This is what works for me now. Just like a single thought can\\'t be captured by a test tube and studied under a microscope to dissect it\\'s essential elements, nor can success.Stages of success:Goal. You\\'ve created something of so much value to the masses that the value gets reflected back to you, like a reflection in a pond on a clear day.People look up to you. Money is showered down. This feels like success.But, one might say, donuts can be mistakenly perceived as creating value for the many. So many people might get pleasure from your donuts that your \"success\" knows no bounds. So this definition might be suspect.Happy. You\\'re happy with a spouse, job, place, and your private creative achievements.You wake up and the birds sing. You\\'re happy. But we all know we age. People die. Creativity always carries on its back the weight of the criticisms all too eager to pile on. So this success is fleeting and hence suspect.Healthy. I always advocate a daily practice: Every day attempt to improve just 1% along physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual pillars.This has been the only thing that has worked for me when I\\'ve been at my lowest points  whether divorce or bankruptcy or a single email criticizing me.But in the pit of my stomach right now is a tiny clench of anxiety about who will I meet today.Who will I reach out to today. What value will I bring today. What can go wrong today.What can go wrong to the people I love today? What anonymous strangers will reach out and attempt to strangle me today? (And that might sound paranoid, but even last night I got an email from someone claiming I\\'ve implanted a chip in his brain and he will \"destroy\" me if he has to.We have bills to pay. We have children to feed. We have people to touch. The world never ends with a bang but slides like a snake from one day to the next.Is it success if we are physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually healthy? If we improve those areas by 1% each day? I think that\\'s closer. Don\\'t forget to live in the present.Presence. Most of my life I time travel.I\\'ve spent much time in the future analyzing the possible alternatives and being afraid of everything bad about to happen. I\\'ve also spent valuable hours in the past, replaying, rewriting, regretting.\"But you have to focus on tomorrow,\" people say, \"so today you can best prepare for it.\"I\\'m staying in a house right now where the owner has a cute pad of \"Lists\"  every day she writes her to-do, grocery, bucket, life, etc. lists.But no matter how many items are on our list, we can only do one thing at a time, and the rest is just stress of the future.I can worry about 15 things, but worrying will only weaken my energy for today and do nothing to solve the problems of tomorrow. No matter what those problems are.Freedom. Some of us are in prison. Some of us are in man-made prisons, forced to do what we don\\'t want to do to feed our families and stay alive. Some of us are in self-imposed prisons, \"if I don\\'t do THIS then I\\'ve FAILED.\"We\\'re the only jailers of these prisons. The doors are always open.We open the doors by lowering our expectations. We walk out the doors when we realize how easy it is to exceed those expectations.Learn what you can. Live what you can. Provide the value you can but just for this moment.In a universe filled with a trillion galaxies and a trillion more years, there is no anointed goal that, when accomplished, will cause you to shout, \"Success!\" That\\'s a myth.Doing the best we can this moment is success. It brings about all the other stages of success described above.The best way to have a successful tomorrow, and a successful life, and a successful legacy, is having a successful moment right now.I can\\'t claim to do it. I try and usually I fail. Success is not meant to be every second. Else, how would you know what to compare it to?Be gentle to yourself. You\\'re a little baby and someone needs to cradle you and whisper to you and love you.Then do the best you can. Right now. And if you can\\'t, then when you can. No self-judging. Maybe that\\'s the best success.The pressure to have a goal, to have success, will take you further and further from success.Be gentle to yourself this moment, and stand in awe of everything we can\\'t possibly understand.(Photo by Kigali Wire)]',\n",
       "  63: \"[Children laugh on average 300 times a day. Adults...5. I don't really know why. Maybe it's our additional responsibilities. How much time do I spend worrying about the future instead of focusing on right now?I suspect I have another 10-20 big changes left in me. I get passionate about something new at least once a year.As for small changes, I try to make them every day. Or I lose practice.* * *Saying No to a change thats begging for you, will kill you. I think I would've died in 2009 without change. Benjamin Franklin said, most people die at 25 but are buried at 75.Who wants to spend 50 years dead?You cant ask the world to change you have to change first.When you start a new change, here is what happens. Well, I have no clue what happens to you. Here is what happens to me.FEAR.I get scared.What will happen to me? Ill go broke! Or be lonely! Or get sick! Or nobody will like what I am doing! Practice dealing with uncertainty is the only way to get comfortable with this fear.Everything is either an obstacle to growth, or an obstacle to keep you from growing. The good thing is: you get to choose.ARGUMENTS.Bosses wont want you to quit. Colleagues will get scared because it means change is forced on them. And depending on your change, maybe family is unhappy (when I was thrown out of school, my family was certainly unhappy).Whoever wrote your script will be unhappy. Youre changing the movie.Theres NOTHING to say to the people who argue with you.Because they are right also. In their life situations, its very right for THEM for you not to quit. Why argue with them? Conserve your energy for your change, not for the weights on your back that will try to hold you down.GUILT.Lets say you are leaving a relationship or a job or an agreement. I can tell you: someone is ready to make you feel guilty about this.Its hard not to feel guilt, particularly if someone is sad because of what you are doing to them.But much worse is the guilt you will feel if you dont make the change your body and the universe is telling you to make. The universe is much bigger than the person on the other side. To go against that flow will make you sink and drown.TEARS.I dont think Ive ever once made a change in my life that didnt involve me crying either on the day of the big change or sometime that week.Why cry? Isnt that a bit wimpy?Change is very lonely.But you will never be lonely if you enjoy being with the person you are alone with.* * *None of the above sounds that great actually. So why change at all?PREVENT MUSCLE ATROPHY\\nWhen a car doesnt start all winter, the engine will get ruined.\\nWhen you dont walk for two weeks, your leg muscles atrophy and you need physical therapy to walk.\\nChange is a muscle.\\nSTEEP FEELS GOODWhen you change you go from a flattening learning curve (your old situation) to a steep learning curve (the new situation).Steep learning curves feel good. Do you like the feeling of touching a new curve?YOU WERE IN THE WRONG SCRIPT.At every stage of our lives, the people around us try to write our scripts.When we are young the script your family writes you might be: school, cubicle, promotions, management, CEO, retirement, death.But you might realize that the right script for you didnt include cubicle.You have to rewrite your script.If you stay in the old script its like acting in a role that is not written for you.You want to be in a work of art, not a forgery or a plagiarism.PLAY.When we were kids we played different games all the time. We would never play the same game for 300 days in a row, for 20 years in a row.But then we got handed our scripts by our parents, schools, political parties, jobs, institutions, etc. We were told to stick to the script. But we never stopped being the boy or girl who wanted to play.AND THEN...Getting good at change (big, small, tiny  every day) means getting good at life.Do it without expectation. Wish for nothing. Care for everything. Happiness will be in between.(Photo by Crystian Cruz)]\",\n",
       "  64: '[\"You interrupt too much,\" people email me. \"Let your guests finish talking.\" But I can\\'t help it. I get curious. I want to know! Now!Over the past year I interviewed about 80 guests for my podcast. My only criteria: I was fascinated by some aspect of each person.I didn\\'t limit myself by saying \"each one had to be an entrepreneur\" or \"had to be a success.\"I just wanted to talk to anyone who made me curious about their lives. I spoke to entrepreneurs, comedians, artists, producers, astronauts, writers, rappers, and even this country\\'s largest beer brewer.Will I do it for the next year? Maybe. It\\'s hard.Sometimes I would pursue a guest for six months with no reply and then they would call and say, \"Can you do right now?\" and I\\'d change all plans with kids, Claudia, business.I had no favorites. They were all great. I interviewed Peter Thiel, Coolio, Mark Cuban, Arianna Huffington, Amanda Palmer, Tony Robbins, and many more. I\\'m really grateful they all wanted to talk to me.Podcasting, to be honest, was just an excuse for me to call up whoever I wanted to call and ask them all sorts of personal questions about their lives. If I wanted to talk about \"Star Wars,\" I called the author of a dozen Star Wars novels.If I wanted to talk about Twisted Sister, I called up the founder of the band. If I wanted to talk sex I called the women who ran the \"Ask Women\" podcast.I wanted to know at what point were they at their worst. And how they got better. Each person created a unique life. I wanted to know how they did it. I was insanely curious.As Coolio told me, \"You got me to reveal some deep stuff I didn\\'t want to reveal. Kudos.\" Tony Robbins had to literally shake himself at one point and say, \"Wait, how did we end up talking about this?\" I can\\'t help it. I want to know.Here are the most important things I learned. I can\\'t specify which person I learned what from. It hurts my head when I think about it because many of the 80 said the exact same thing about how they ended up where they were.Here is some of what they said:A) A life is measured in decades.Too many people want happiness, love, money, connections, everything yesterday. Me too. I call it \"the disease.\" I feel often I can paint over a certain emptiness inside if only...if only...I have X.But a good life is like the flame of a bonfire. It builds slowly, and because it\\'s slow and warm it caresses the heart instead of destroys it.B) A life is measured by what you did TODAY, even this moment.This is the opposite of \"A\" but the same. You get success in decades by having success now.That doesn\\'t mean money now. It means, \"Are you doing your best today?\"Everyone worked at physical health, improving their friendships and connections with others, being creative, being grateful. Every day.For those who didn\\'t, they quickly got sick, depressed, anxious, fearful. They had to change their lives. When they made that change, universally they all said to me, \"that\\'s when it all started.\"C) Focus is not important, but Push is (reinvention).Very few people have just one career. And for every career, it\\'s never straight up.When you have focus, it\\'s like saying, \"I\\'m just going to learn about only one thing forever.\" But \"the push\" is the ability to get up every day, open up the shades, and push through all the things that make you want to go back to sleep.Even if it means changing careers 10 times. Or changing your life completely. Just pushing forward to create a little more life inside yourself.Compound life is much more powerful than compound interest.D) Give without thinking of what you will receive.I don\\'t think I spoke to a single person who believed in setting personal goals. But 100% of the people I spoke to wanted to solve a problem for the many.It doesn\\'t matter how you give each day. It doesn\\'t even matter how much. But everyone wanted to give and eventually they were given back.E) Solving hard problems is more important than overcoming failure.The outside world is a mirror of what you have on the inside. If Thomas Edison viewed his 999 attempts at creating a lightbulb a failure then he would\\'ve given up. His inside was curious. His inside viewed his \"attempts\" as experiments. Then he did #1000. Now we can see in the dark.Dan Ariely was burned all over his body and used that experience to research the psychology of pain and ultimately the psychology of behavior and how we can make better decisions.Tony Robbins lost everything when his marriage ended, but he came back by coaching thousands of people.It\\'s how you view the life inside you that creates the life outside of you. Every day.F) Art and success and love is about connecting all the dots.Here are some dots: The very personal sadness sitting inside of you. The things you learn. The things you read about. The things you love. Connect the dots. Give it to someone.Now you just gave birth to a legacy that will continue beyond you.G) It\\'s not business, it\\'s personal.Nobody succeeded with a great idea.Everyone succeeded because they built networks within networks of connections, friends, colleagues all striving towards their own personal goals, all trusting each other, and working together to help each other succeed.This is what happens only over time. This is why giving creates a bigger world because you can never predict what will happen years later.Biz Markie described to me how he helped a 7-year-old kid named Jay-Z with his lyrics.Peter Thiel\\'s ex employees created tens of billions of dollars worth of companies.Marcus Lemonis saves businesses every week on his show \"The Profit.\" It doesn\\'t come by fixing their accounting. It comes from fixing the relationships with the partners and the customers and the investors.The best way to create a great business over time: Every day send one thank you letter to someone from your past. People (me) often say you can\\'t look back at the past. But this is the one way you can. You create the future by thanking the past.H) You can\\'t predict the outcome, you can only do your best.Hugh Howey thought he would write novels that only his family would read. So he wrote ten of them. Then he wrote \"Wool,\" which he self-published and has sold millions of copies and Ridley Scott is making the movie.Clayton Anderson applied to be an astronaut for 15 years in a row and was rejected each time until the 16th.Coolio wrote lyrics down every day for 17 years before having a hit. Noah Kagan was fired from Facebook and Mint without making a dime before starting his own business. Wayne Dyer quit his secure job as a tenured professor, put a bunch of his books in car and drove across the country selling them in every bookstore. Now he\\'s sold over 100,000,000 books.Sometimes when I have conversations with these people they want to jump right to the successful parts but I stop them. I want to know the low points. The points where they had to start doing their best. What got them to that point.I) The same philosophy of life should work for an emperor and a slave.Ryan Holiday told me that both Marcus Aurelius, an emperor, and Epictetus, a slave, both subscribed to the idea of stoicism. You can\\'t predict pleasure or pain. You can only strive for knowledge and giving and fairness and health each day.Many people write me it\\'s easy for so-and-so to say that now that he\\'s rich. Every single person I spoke to started off in a gutter or worse. (Well, most of them.)Luck is certainly a component, but in chess there\\'s a saying (and this applies to anything) \"it\\'s funny how always the best players seem to be lucky.\"J) The only correct path is the path correct for you.Scott Adams tried about 20 different careers before he settled on drawing Dilbert. Now, he\\'s in 2000 papers, has written Dilbert books, Dilbert shows, Dilbert everything. Everyone was shocked when Judy Joo gave up a Wall St. career to go back to cooking school. Now she\\'s on the Food Channel as an \"iron chef.\"Don\\'t let other people choose your careers. Don\\'t get locked in other people\\'s prisons they\\'ve set up just for you. Personal freedom starts from the inside but ultimately turns you into a giant, freeing you from the chains the little people spent years tying around you.K) Many moments of small, positive, personal interactions build an extraordinary career.Often people think that you have to fight your way to the top. But for everyone I spoke to it was small kindnesses over a long period of time that built the ladder to success. I think I\\'m starting to sound like a cliche on this. But it\\'s only a cliche because it\\'s true.L) Taking care of yourself comes first.Kamal Ravikant picked himself off a suicidal bottom by constantly repeating \"I love you\" to himself. Charlie Hoehn cured his anxiety by using every moment he could to play.I\\'ve written before: The average kid laughs 300 times a day. The average adult...5.Something knifed our ability to smile. Do everything you can to laugh, to create laughter for others, and then what can possibly be bad about today? I think that\\'s why I try to interview so many comedians are comedy writers. They make me laugh. It\\'s totally selfish.M) The final answer: People do end up loving what they succeed at, or they succeed at what they love.Mark Cuban said, \"My passion was to get rich!\" But I don\\'t really believe him. He loved computers so he created a software company. Then he wanted to watch Ohio basketball in Pittsburgh so he created Broadcast.com. I worked with Broadcast.com a little bit back in 1997. They were crusaders about bringing video to the Internet.Sure, he wanted to use that to get rich. Because he knew better than anyone then how to let a good idea lead him to success.But deep down he was a little kid who wanted to watch his favorite basketball. And now what does he do? He owns a basketball team.N) Anybody, at any ageThe ages of the people I spoke to ranged from 20 to 75. Each is still participating every day in the worldwide conversation. I asked Dick Yuengling from Yuengling beer why he even bothered to talk to me. He\\'s 75 and runs the biggest American-owned brewery worth about $2 billion. He laughed and said, \"Well, you asked me.\"I just realized this list can go on for another 100 items.The specifics of success. How to overcome hardships. How any one person can move society forward.Down to even what are the most productive hours of the day, what\\'s the one word most important for success, and what we can look forward to over the next century and maybe 100 other things.Then I learned many things about myself.Most of the people I asked to come on my podcast said, \"NO!\" I told Claudia the other day I haven\\'t been rejected this much since freshman year of high school. I had to re-learn how to deal with so much rejection.I\\'ve always been a big reader but never as much as this year. I read everything by all the guests.Some weeks I felt like I was spending 10 hours a day preparing for podcasts. I learned to interview, to listen, to prepare, to pursue, to entertain, to educate.Podcasting seems like it\\'s becoming an industry, or a business idea, or something worth looking at by entrepreneurs or investors. I have no clue about that.For me, podcasting this year was just about calling anyone I wanted to call and talking to them. I felt like a little boy interviewing his heroes.I highly recommend finding ways to call people for almost no reason. I learned a huge amount.But it was hard.It\\'s one of those things where I can say, \"I don\\'t know if I can ever do that again.\" But I also know I\\'m probably going to say the same thing next year.(You can subscribe to my podcast here.)]',\n",
       "  65: '[I was out of ideas when I googled \"how to kill myself\".I was sure that three things were going to happen: I\\'d go broke (and then my 3 year old would starve to death), nobody would kiss me ever again, and I would die because of course self worth = net worth (duh!).I started coming up with 10 ideas a day and I\\'ve written about this several times before: it saved my life, my career, my friendships, made me better friendships, partners, opportunities, a wife, better relationships with my kids, and oooga-booga (lots of kisses).In 2011, I wrote a post \"how to be the luckiest person alive\" where I described a daily practice I started to follow to get off the floor of suicide. Physical Emotional Mental and Spiritual health were the four pillars of this practice.Under \"Mental\" was the approach that if you don\\'t exercise your \"idea muscle\" every day it would atrophy and you would lose the ability to be creative.So I encouraged people to write 10 ideas every day. I write 10 ideas every day no matter what. Yesterday, for instance, I wrote 10 ideas how Airbnb can be improved. Today I haven\\'t written my list yet.Over the past 4 years I\\'ve gotten a lot of questions about this approach. Many of the questions have been the same over and over again.I\\'ve also gotten a lot of testimonials (unasked for) from people who told me they tried this approach and all the amazing things that happened to them afterwards.For me, I can safely say, my life completely changes almost 100% every six months in every way because I simply write down 10 ideas a day.Here I\\'m going to try and answer the questions that I often get asked. If you don\\'t like my answers then feel free to ignore them.If you have more questions, ask them in the comments and I will answer.Different approaches work for different people. This approach works for me and I now see has worked for many others.A) Is \"The Idea Muscle\", or the Mental side of your daily practice, the most important part of the four?No. They are all equally important. If you get sick, then you can\\'t be as creative.If you are staying up to midnight arguing with the loved ones in your life then you can\\'t be creative (I learned this particularly well during my divorce).If you are anxious all day instead of grateful (the spiritual side of the practice) then you can\\'t be creative.Worry never solves the future and always takes away energy from the present.Of course, you can try. But it\\'s hard. If a chair has four legs then it\\'s sturdy. If you remove one leg, then you can still sit in it but it will fall over at the slightest wind. And we all have the winds of change blowing in our lives.If you remove two of the legs then you will fall over. And if you try to sit in a one-legged chair then you probably need serious help in general.B) Do you have a theme each day for your ideas?Yes. As a simple example it might be \"10 businesses I can start?\" Or \"10 books I can write\" or \"10 chapters I can write for a book on quality parenting\" (which would obviously be a fiction book).Claudia is coming out with a book at the end of January with 180 possible themes.A theme is like a target, and knowing that you can come up with 10 decent ideas gets you closer and closer to hitting the bullseye on the target.C) What if I can\\'t come up with 10 ideas?Here\\'s the key: the first three ideas are always easy. The next two are a little harder, and for me, I find that ideas 5-10 make my brain literally sweat. It almost hurts.Ideas, art, business, life is all about connecting the dots of one area of your life with the dots in other areas of your life.Doing this directly translates into biologically building up the neural pathways between collections of neurons in your brain.This is what changes you from becoming a person with the occasional idea, to a creative person, to an idea machine. You become the one-eyed king in the land of the blind.D) My idea muscle has atrophied. How long will it take to become an idea machine?If you come up with 10 ideas a day for 180 days I\\'m pretty convinced based on what I\\'ve seen from 100s or 1000s of others then you will be a full force idea machine.E) What is an idea machine?It means that you can have confidence that no matter what situation you are in, you can start spewing ideas to help yourself and others in that situation. Ideas are about giving. And the more you give to the world, the more value you get back.Almost everything you look at will become sources of inspiration. Almost every problem you hear about you\\'ll be able to come up with solutions.Will they be good solutions? No, not necessarily. Which brings me too.F) Do all 10 ideas have to be good ideas?That would be impossible. If you are writing 10 ideas a day, that\\'s 3,650 ideas a year.Nobody can come up with 3,650 good ideas a year. Someone who is a creative genius coming up with non-stop ideas might come up with a handful (less than 10) really good ideas and maybe slightly more (less than 100), decent ideas and the rest are probably bad ideas.Part of the idea of this exercise is give yourself permission to come up with bad ideas. To love yourself by recognizing that nobody is perfect.There\\'s a story the advertising legend George Lois wrote where he says that he told everyone to come up with a great idea for a client. He came back in an hour and nobody had any ideas at all.So he said, \"ok, come up with 20 ideas.\" He came back in an hour and everyone had 20 ideas. Some good, some bad, some decent. That\\'s because they released the idea of perfectionism.If you are a perfectionist, you will never come up with good ideas. You have to love yourself enough to come up with bad ideas and still be happy and confident.If you wait for inspiration, you will never come up with good ideas.Inspiration is not like lightning. It doesn\\'t strike. It\\'s always there, like a deep well. Only by digging every day, do we get to tap into that well.G) I have so many ideas, I don\\'t know which ones to work on? How do you pick?I never do. I always throw out my idea list for the day. The whole purpose of the exercise is to (metaphorically) expand the brain. Nothing else.Now, if an idea truly sets your heart on fire, then you won\\'t forget it. The next day you\\'ll come up with ten ideas to expand on that first idea. Or ten next steps to get that idea going.When you are an idea machine, trust that this will happen. Again: the ideas that are good will literally set your heart and mind on fire and you won\\'t be able to wait to come up with the next batch of ideas for them.Don\\'t think too much about which ideas are good and which ideas are bad. 99.99% of ideas are bad.Once, when I came up with the idea for a good business (one among ten business ideas I wrote the day before), then the next day I came up with ten pages that would be on the website for that business.And the next day I came up with ten ideas for partners that business might have. And the next day I came up with 10 ways I can execute on this business.And that morning I started executing on that business. Two weeks later I had a big partner for that business. Eight months later I sold the business. Every week in between I had more and more features for that business.I was excited about it. I loved it. I thought every day about it. If you have to look back at prior lists to remember the ideas, then they didn\\'t excite you enough. Don\\'t do it.H) What is Idea sex?All of life is about connecting the dots.This is not a poetic metaphor. Since the Big Bang that created the universe, every piece of matter is the result of atoms combining and creating something new.Life on Earth is about organic molecules combining and creating something new.Societies are formed when people connect to form babies, when groups of people connect to form tribes, when tribes connect to form cities, or countries, and so on.Any achievement in science is the connection of all the achievements before it. As evidence, look at any patent and see all the prior patents it refers to.Any achievement in art is the accumulated knowledge and experience of all the artists and musicians and even scientists and philosophers, as well as personal experiences of the artist, that came before it.I once did an experiment with a group of people. Write down 10 titles of books you would like to write. Now turn to your partner. Make a list of ten books combining the titles.I asked for some examples. I loved all the results. For instance, a \"How to Make Toast in Space\" or \"A History of Music as Told by the Instruments of the greatest performers\". And so on.If you turn on any late night comedy show, the opening monologue is almost all idea sex. News topics of the day combined with \"set up / punch line\".The fastest way to generate themes and ideas is to take two different areas and combine them.The fastest way to master any area of life, is to become good at two or more areas, intersect them in a unique way, and now you are the best in the world at the intersection.If you look at every great achievement in history, idea sex was the impregnation of that achievement.I) People say ideas are a dime a dozen and that execution is everything. Is this true?No. Ideas are a dime for 3. A dozen ideas are hard. Try it.And execution, of course, is the key to making something happen in the real world. But the purpose of this exercise is to just stay healthy in a creative way.Ultimately, execution ideas are a subset of ideas.Here\\'s one experiment to try: make two columns. The first column might be \"10 new business ideas\". The second column might be \"10 first execution steps\".So if my business idea is \"make an Isreali-Cuban fusion restaurant\" (bad idea). And my first execution step might be: \"Cook an Israeli-Cuban meal and invite 10 friends over and charge them $30 and see if they like it.\"Always start with easy execution steps. MVEs. Minimum viable execution steps.J) Are the ideas usually about starting new businesses?No, usually not. It\\'s really hard to come up with 3,650 business ideas a year.Money is just a side effect of being an idea machine.I try to make it about anything. \"50 alternatives to college\" was created this way.Or \"10 Ways I\\'d improve self-publshing\" which I sent to Amazon and they invited me to come out there and see what they were working on.Or \"10 ideas for a novel\" or \"10 pairs of people I should introduce to each other\". And on and on. \"10 things I can cook for Claudia tonight\" (that one was REALLY hard for me. I\\'m not a good cook).K) I keep coming up with good ideas but then I go out drinking with my friends on Friday night and tell them my ideas and they all laugh at me. What should I do?Stay home on Friday night.L) I\\'ve been doing this for three months and I haven\\'t seen any difference in my life?Do it for three more months and you will. Every day.In order to build a house, the foundation has to be strong.The foundation gets strong when you focus on all areas of the daily practice. Physical health, emotional health (be around people you love), and spiritual health.Anger, envy, self-pity, regret, anxiety are all fires that burn the foundation. Gratitude and surrender washes away those fires.Then you can build your house. Then you can live in it.M) I have no time to do this. What should I do?Simplify your life. The simpler every part of your life is, the more power you have to make significant changes in the world.The first thing is: do you really have no time? I\\'ve now spoken to or read about two different people who have written best-selling novels on their train commutes to work.Another key is to avoid meaningless gossip at work. Or to stop watching bad TV at night. Or to wake up a half hour earlier than usual. Or to spend 15 less minutes surfing on Facebook.Heck, make a list of the 10 ways you waste time every day.I have found in my own life that these fragments of time often add up to hours a day.The other thing is to do what I call the simple daily practice. Do tiny things. Maybe don\\'t snack today (Physical), maybe write a thank you email to someone you love (emotional), come up with 10 ideas (mental), spend 10 minutes feeling grateful (spiritual).There\\'s always time. Nobody starts off at the top. Which leads to...N) I have an Idea. How do I get money for it?You don\\'t. You have to implement it. You have to have other people who like it. You have to get money from customers who like it. You have to build up so that it can support yourself.For my first business, I started it, got customers, got employees, had an office, and then, 18 months into it, I quit my fulltime job, and went to my startup fulltime.That\\'s how business works in the real world.We live in an entitled world now where people think ideas are enough now to get funding and make billions.Go old school. Deliver proven value to others, charge money for it, get testimonials about how good your product is, and then you\\'ve widened the horizon of your decisions. That\\'s the path to success.O) How do I know if an idea is good?Well, chances are it\\'s pretty bad. The key again is to expand the abilities of your brain so you are a non-stop idea machine. This way you are more likely to come up with a good idea.A great story is the story of the company, Odeo.They created software for podcasting. They got professional venture capitalists investing. The CEO previously sold a company to Google so he knew what he was doing. He had the top software programmers working for him.But nobody wanted his software. On the side, Odeo\\'s programmers had a side project going, but it only had 10,000 users. Smaller audience than most good blogs. And yet...The CEO told all of his investors, \"we give up. We\\'re going to work on this side project. If you want to stay in, good. If you want out, I will buy all of your shares so you wont\\' lost any money.\"The result: 100% of the top, most professional investors in the business took their money back. The CEO renamed the company and focused on the tiny software project.A few years later Twitter became public and is worth tens of billions of dollars.Nobody can predict the outcome of an idea. And usually people are wrong. That\\'s why quantity is important.The key is to every day stay physically emotionally mentally and spiritually healthy.Then you can trust that you have built the inner foundation for outward success.The outer world that you face every morning is always a reflection of the inner world that only you can create.P) What if I have more than 10 ideas a day? Should I save some of them for the next day?No, write them all down. THIS POST is my idea list of the day. I just wrote down 16 items Yesterday was 10. The day before was about 12.What\\'s going to happen if you do this for six months?You\\'re going to be a mutant superhero.You\\'re going to have fun creative ideas for every situation. You\\'re going to be able to see which ideas set your brain on nuclear.You\\'re going to meet the right people who can help you execute on ideas.

       "  66: '[I forgot to tell you something. I have a business partner named Dan.A friend of mine asked another friend of mine a few months ago: \"how come James doesn\\'t have any business partners over the long run\".Mostly because I just write about bad stuff. Good stuff is boring. But it\\'s important also.How come? Because when you hit bottom, as we all do, sometimes you need one good person to remind you that everything is going to be ok.Dan has been my partner since 1999. So about 15 years.When 9/11 happened, we were running a hedge fund. We had both eaten breakfast right at the World Trade Center. We were walking up the street a block or so away and we saw a plane cruising right at us. Dan said, \"Is the President coming to town?\"And then the plane whizzed over, everyone had a reflex to duck. Then we heard a BOOM!I don\\'t like to tell this story because obviously many people had it much worse. But I was all set to kill myself I was so depressed. Dan came over and told me, we have to keep moving forward.So we did. And it didn\\'t work out. We failed miserably. That\\'s another story.Then we started a fund of funds. It worked out ok, but not great. Then we did other deals that worked out ok. Then we started 9 different businesses that failed. Then we started Stockpickr that succeeded. Then we made lots more deals, investments, opportunities, etc.One time in 2007-2008 I disappeared. I was supposed to be writing articles for thestreet.com. But I was depressed and couldn\\'t get out of bed. Couldn\\'t move.Instead, Dan wrote them for me. He knew my style and I\\'d take a look at the finished product and put my name at the bottom. For an entire year I was a pretty bad guy.Dan covered for me until I got balanced on the dangerous high wire between youth and maturity.But mostly that year I was largely unconscious. In every way. 23 hours a day I was doing bad things. Sometimes I\\'d go on CNBC and I\\'d call Dan and ask him what to say. He\\'d feed me the lines. I\\'d say them. People would laugh.Dan works in a basement in his mom\\'s house in the midwest. His grandma is his next-door neighbor. His brothers are on the other side of his house. His parents live in back of his house. He\\'s a family guy. He refused to go on my podcast. He doesn\\'t want anyone to know who he is. He probably hates that I\\'m writing this. Tough!In 2003, Turkey had a terrorist attack at 3 in the morning. I called Dan and woke him up. I was too nervous to trade. He sold everything we owned. Then at 4am I changed my mind and called him and woke him up again. He bought back everything.One time we were going to sell a company in 2006. The deal was really bad. I wanted to take it anyway. I was desperate for money. Dan said, \"if you take this deal I guarantee you will be jumping off the Empire State Building within a year.\"We didn\\'t take the deal. Instead we started another business which worked out very well.When Dan was getting married in 2004, about five minutes before he was to say \"I do\" to his beautiful wife he found me in the audience and came over and asked me, \"Did we get the wire?\"We had in fact, the day before, got a huge wire which started our fund of funds. He said, \"YES!\" and then went up and got married.In 2008 we were both in danger of losing everything. We were scared. We started at least four businesses and none of them worked. Most of them were my ideas but Dan never blamed me for costing us a ton of money. Every day we kept trying and eventually things worked.15 years is a long time to be a partner with someone. Particularly when things go really really bad in the middle. Up and down. Up and down. Up and down. Fugh and Ugh.I fully expect we\\'ll be partners for the next 15. Then maybe I\\'ll stop returning calls completely and just walk into the ocean. I don\\'t know. It\\'s a long time away.One thing we\\'ve always learned: if we have zero money in June, we might be rich by October.Nothing was predictable. It is senseless to have a goal.We simply had a direction: every day we\\'d look for opportunities rather than regret our circumstances. This is the key for success.Many people tried to take advantage of us and give us bad deals but sooner or later we\\'d cut them off.I hope now, after dealing with at least 100 people who try to suck the life out of you, who will stab you in the back but smile to your face, that I know how to handle that better. But it\\'s hard. Partners are good to help with that.It\\'s hard to fly solo. Sooner or later someone falls asleep at the wheel and the other person has to drive for awhile. That\\'s how you drive across country without stopping.The most important choices I\\'ve ever made in my life. Who will my wife be? Who will my friends be? Who will my partners be?Whenever I let other people make those choices for me, it didn\\'t work out. There had to be a warmth in me that made those choices. Else, they would flame out and I\\'d explode.This is your new family when you are an adult.If you choose right, then later choices become simple. The less effort you have to give something, the more powerful you become.Dan is good at what he\\'s good at. I\\'m good at what I\\'m good at. They are two different things and they don\\'t overlap so we\\'ve never really had an opportunity to argue in all of the past 15 years. I don\\'t think even once.The only other thing that\\'s important when finding a partner is character. It doesn\\'t matter if your partner is the smartest person in the world. Intelligence gets you only so far. Character changes the world.Well, I just wrote about a good thing. Maybe tomorrow I\\'ll start writing about bad things again. About being homeless or helpless or scared or angry.Or maybe I\\'ll just relax. Let the dead bury the dead.(Photo by Chris Potter)]',\n",
       "  67: '[I was lonely and I wanted money. I was living in a one bedroom apartment in Astoria, Queens, NYC in 1995. I knew nobody in the area. I would write my phone number on two dollar bills and tip waitresses with them. Nobody called me. Everyone in Astoria is Greek. And they pretty much stick to themselves.Nobody would talk to me. I would walk for miles in Astoria hoping that just one person would talk to me.Weekends were the worst. I missed my friends at work. The Museum of the Moving Image was down the street so I would go there to watch various indie movies. Two things: the Hal Hartley retrospective was great. And the collection of Bill Cosby sweaters that he wore in his 80s show was prominently on display. The woman taking the tickets didnt like me because I always flashed my HBO ID to get in free.I had about $20 in the bank and lived paycheck to paycheck. I would walk around every part of Manhattan and think to myself, who are the millions of people who can afford to live here but I cant?Adrian called me. I have to do this diamond website, can you help? We went over to Shlomos on 47th Street. Shlomo told me that all the diamonds on 47th Street get smuggled into the US to avoid taxes.I asked him how they get smuggled. He said, I will tell you a joke.\"Two jews are coming back from Russia. One keeps squirming the whole plane ride. The other jew finally asks him, Moishe, why all the squirming?Moishe says, Because Im sorting the inventory!Shlomo laughed. Adrian laughed. I thought to myself, I am never going to buy a diamond.Shlomo wanted to put online his wholesale business which he used to sell to all the diamond dealers on 47th Street (known in NYC as the diamond district. If you walk down 47th Street it\\'s all tourists and Hasidic Jews) and sell direct to the consumer. I dont want my name anywhere on this! If anyone on the street knew I was doing this they would kill me. Arguably this would be the first diamond site on the Internet. Before Blue Nile, before Tiffanys went online. Before anything.He gave us a file that was his entire database. Every diamond was one line on the file with all the features separated by commas. The shape of the diamond, the 4Cs (cut, clarity, carats, color), the number of the GIA certificate (since certification is the universal scam, even diamonds have to be certified by some bogus organization). He just wanted the database online and a simple design. People would select a diamond on the site and then send him an email and he would call them. Simple.My room in Astoria had one foam mattress in it, cockroaches in the bathroom, a phone, and a black and white TV about 3 inches diagonal that never worked. I didnt realize that in NYC you needed cable to get a TV to work. I had no chairs, no sheets, no plates or glasses, no food, no closet, no dressers, and kept all of my clothes in a garbage bag. Even if a waitress spoke to me, what was I going to do? I felt worthless. I needed the money.The next day Chet called me and asked me what I was up to. I told him about the diamond project. What programming language are you going to use? I told him I thought I would use C++ but I wasnt sure. I figured it would take me about a month with C++.James, James, nononono, he said, trust me on this. Go to the bookstore. G-g-g-get OReillys book on PERL.Trust me. Chet had a slight stutter when he was excited. His mind was too fast for his words.Whats PERL?Just trust me. Get the book. Then call me.I got the book, went into Adrians office and set up a simple Perl programming environment (downloadable from a dozen sources). Did the basic Hello, world program. Kept flipping through the book.I called Chet later that day. Did you get the book? he asked.I finished the whole project, I said. I even added an extra flourish. I found a Perl library for manipulating graphic images so I used it to create the GIA certificates on the fly as images. Perl became my favorite programming language for all Internet projects back then.(my first site)- - -Lessons:\\nLearn a programming language quickly by modifying other code. I found code for searching a database. I just modified that and fed in this database. As long as you know the basic tools: if, then, loops, recursion, the syntax of the language, functions, etc you can learn any programming language by having a book for the basic syntax and modifying other code.\\nAlways add an extra flourish. ALWAYS. No matter what. This was my first client. Of the next five jobs I did, three of them offered me a full time job with double or triple the salary I was making at HBO. Its because I always delivered that extra something. This is more than underpromise and overdeliver. This is using creativity to make the clients life better. And to always have the element of surprise. They know that when you walk in the door magic will happen, doves will fly. I was the magician.\\nAlways talk to someone smarter than you are and get their advice on how to do a job.\\n- - -We delivered to Shlomo. He couldnt believe how fast we did it. He couldnt believe we also did the GIA certificates the way we did. He gave us more work.He paid us in cash. $35,000. I took, $17,500.I walked over to The Chelsea Hotel on 23rd Street and said I wanted to move in. They were known for only letting artists and writers live there. Arthur C Clarke wrote 2001: A Space Odyssey there. Madonna wrote Sex there. Dylan Thomas died on the steps leading in. Nancy was stabbed there (Sid and Nancy). I was told to wait for Stanley Bard to see me. He owned the hotel. I waited for two hours and then he took me into the office. I gave him the $17,500 in cash and asked if I could live there for a year.He looked at the cash. It was in a paper bag from a supermarket, in hundreds. What are you, he said, a drug dealer? I shouldve added, the Chelsea Hotel was known for letting artists, writers, and drug dealers live there. And high-end prostitutes. And some not very high-end. I didnt want to say I worked on the Internet. That was very uncool back then. It meant I was a computer geek. Not good.I said, I work at HBO.Ok, he said. And he took me up to the first floor, to the right, to the room where Nancy was stabbed (it had been divided into two rooms by then). You can stay here, he said. I later moved several times to different parts of the building. Every floor in the Chelsea had its own little subculture. I felt like an anthropologist as I moved up the different floors, studying the species that inhabited each floor. There was art hanging everywhere. All of the art was awful.Recently, Adrian called me. He was still working on the site, diamondcutters.com. I think even now hes still working on it. Shlomo is dead, he said. What happened? I said.He was flying a plane around Russia. I guess looking for diamonds. The plane crashed.I thought of Shlomos joke about the squirming Jew flying back from Russia. I thought how Shlomo never really liked me. In 1999 I talked him into paying a million dollars to theknot.com to become the exclusive diamond dealer on their site but it resulted in almost no sales for him. He never spoke to me again after that.I thought of the girl who worked in his office who had the huge scar down one side of her face. I thought of how I loved her and wanted to lick her scar and be the only one to tell her how beautiful she was.Shlomos dead. Im alive.]',\n",
       "  68: '[Ugh, turn the computer off, Claudia! Ugh, Gag, I have to throw up now. I\\'m going to throw up. She just accidentally hit play on one of my podcasts. I\\'m talking. I hear my own voice.You would think we get over that eventually. Like when you\\'re a grown human being. I HATE IT.\"Do I sound like that?\" I asked her and I thought I was honestly having a gag reflex. She\\'s like, \"What?\" And I\\'m, \"DO I SOUND LIKE THAT!? HOLY SHIT!\"She couldn\\'t figure out how to turn it down.\"TURN IT OFF!\"She turned it off and reached out to me but I was reverting to the fetal position and was about to climb back into my mother\\'s vagina.Ok, I\\'m ok now. Ok. ok.\"You sound lovely, honey,\" she said but that\\'s it. I hate podcasting. I\\'m going to quit. Done. I\\'m glad she\\'s nice to me though. Now I feel better. \"Ok, I\\'ll podcast again. But not until tomorrow.\" Moods can be like that. Right?The only way to get better is to hear my own podcasts. I know that. But I just can\\'t do it. There\\'s a lot of things I would get better at if I were not secretly afraid of them. That\\'s one of them.People say they want to do all sorts of things but in reality they are just afraid of them. I shouldn\\'t say \"people\". What do I know? I mean \"me\". Or \"I\". Whatever.But you can try this with me. What are the things you are truly afraid of but you\\'d like to do.Some people are afraid to put hard work into something they love and then ask money for that. I know many yoga teachers and artists are ashamed to ask for money for something they view as beyond money.I am not saying they are right or wrong, it\\'s just hard. This Friday I\\'m chatting with Amanda Palmer about her book, \"The Art of Asking\".She had to get over her fear of asking for money for her work. As she puts it, she was afraid that if she asked then the \"Fraud Police\" would be after her.I can relate to that. I can relate to it so much Claudia and I were supposed to write a book called \"The Power of ASK\" but after Amanda wrote her book I decided to stop ours and write something else.For me, right now I\\'m afraid of:A) Standup comedy.I really want to go to an open mic and just do it. I have material written. I\\'m all set. I must be afraid of it. I can\\'t imagine any other reason I\\'m not doing it.I sort of do standup comedy in my talks but that\\'s easier. People ask me to talk about something else so they aren\\'t there for just me joking around. I have fun with that and I get about 1-2 laughs a minute. But going in front of a crowd that doesn\\'t know me just to make them laugh somehow scares me.Standup comedy seems to me like the holy grail.Dick Costolo, CEO of Twitter, tells a story about how a year or so ago he ran into Steve Carrell at a reunion of people who worked together on improv at Second City in Chicago. Dick was already CEO of Twitter and Steve Carrell had just finished his stupendous run at \"The Office\".Steve said to Dick, \"Well, I\\'m really sorry it didn\\'t work out for you.\"B) Novel.I wrote 4 or 5 about 20 years ago and they were awful. You have to do \"awful\" in order to put in your 20,000 hours. Since then I\\'ve written quite a bit that I like but no fiction.Maybe the closest is the book, \"The Choose Yourself Stories\" which tells stories but is not quite fiction.I\\'ve started and stopped three or four times this year. There must be something I\\'m afraid of there. Like maybe it won\\'t be good. I don\\'t know. If I had the answers I probably wouldn\\'t be afraid of it.C) More speaking events.I like how Marianne Williamson does a talk every Monday in LA. I think she does it for free. I admire that consistency.D) Dinner.All these great networkers organize amazing dinners and invite their favorite people. One of these days I\\'m going to do that but haven\\'t gotten around to it yet.I\\'m not too much afraid of anything else. I try to focus each day on incremental improvement in what I call my \"daily practice\". I know that the best way for an improved tomorrow is to work on it today.What are the things you are afraid of? You can tell me. I promise I won\\'t tell anyone.Meanwhile, I\\'m going to listen to my podcast for the first time.Maybe then I can finally improve at this thing I love doing.(Photo by Ben B)]',\n",
       "  69: '[I\\'ll tell you why. It\\'s because I was prejudiced. I didn\\'t want to interview Adam Grant, author of \"Give and Take\" for a simple reason: he was the youngest tenured professor at Wharton.So he rose up through the ranks, smart guy, wrote a book, got tenure, big success.The standard ladder. The anti-choose yourself ladder. The higher education ladder.But then I read the book. I friended him on Facebook. I asked if I could talk to him. And then we did the interview.How come? Because I wanted therapy.The book is a simple model for dividing people into three categories. Givers, Matchers, and Takers.I should add that many people were telling me I was crazy to not interview Adam. And now I agree with them.But while I was reading the book I was thinking selfishly the whole time, \"hmm, I hope I\\'m a giver and not a taker.\"In part, because I like to think of myself as someone who is giving. That sounds nice. It even sounds romantic as opposed to thinking of yourself as someone who is always \"taking\".But also because givers tend to succeed more according to Adam. They also tend to fail more. So it depends. You have to be a giver who gives to \"champs\" and not \"chumps\".I definitely used to take a lot. I would take all I could. Not because I was evil (I hope) but because I was scared.If I didn\\'t take, someone else would. I was scared I would go broke. Or wouldn\\'t feed my family. Or wouldn\\'t find the girl. Or someone would take credit for something I did. On and on. I was scared and hid in my closet against the monsters.I think \"taking\" ruined my life for at least ten or so years. I saw the world as a small place and not a big universe.When you take, it\\'s like the world is divided into eight slices of pizza and either you eat one of the slices or someone else does.The reality is: when you Give, you create a bigger world.If I introduce two people today and they create something of value without me being in the middle, then the world just became a bigger place.If I help a colleague at work do their job better, then my workplace just got bigger. If I answer a question sent to me from somewhere in Pakistan and their lives get a little better, than the entire world just got microscopically bigger.The more you give, your universe compounds into something infinite. There\\'s no end to the universe, but when you give you push out your boundaries more and more. More air to breathe, more room to maneuver, more opportunities to succeed.I know one guy who \"takes\" a lot but he does it by pretending to \"give\".He once wrote me that he was now finally \"calling in all the favors he had ever done\" and he asked me to do something.He kept writing me. I finally had to write back and say, \"I\\'m happy to help but what exactly did you do for me that you keep reminding me about.\" He didn\\'t reply.We all know takers who wear the clothes of a giver.I asked Adam about this. He said, \"if you are a giver and you are dealing with a taker, you have to act like a matcher - in other words, make sure up front you are getting something for your giving.\" But in all other situations just give.He described the story of Adam Rifkin, an entrepreneur/VC in Silicon Valley who is a massive giver. He might do a favor for someone, forget about it, and then ten years later the favor is returned in some unexpected way, or maybe it is never returned. Who knows?When a good gardener plants his seeds, he has faith that some small percentage of the seeds will grow. That is the nature of a giver.Rifkin has a concept he calls \"the five minute favor\". It\\'s a way of easily planting as many seeds as possible not only during the day, but during a year, during a career, during a lifetime.Perhaps the most important thing I\\'ve learned in the past few years is that success can be measured in two ways:\\nHow successful were you today? Because that\\'s the best predictor of tomorrow\\'s success. \\nAnd how successful are you over decades?\\nBecause that shows persistence, it shows your ability to do \"the push\", to solve and master hard problems, to put in the 10,000 hours ultimately of mastery, and it allows the plants you seed to compound into abundance.A great example is Coolio writing every day for 17 years before having a single hit. Or Michelle Phan making 53 videos before the 54th finally reaching superstar status. Or Walt Disney\\'s first company going bankrupt, and then his next efforts at animation doing nothing better than break-even and then finally perhaps hundreds of experiments in animation later, creating Snow White 20 years after his start.There is a strong link between the two types of success. The five minute favor leads directly to the three decades of success.I\\'m in my third decade of my career (I\\'m 46). I can safely say this is true.That the moments when I took a break from anxiety about money, about gossip, about the people I thought were trying to bring me down, about the pain of relationships failing, and instead took those moments to provide value or help people or work towards a vision I thought was bigger than myself - those are the moments that I can see added up to every success I\\'ve ever had.Does this mean I had to wait for 20 years? No. do one five minute favor and you can see the magic happen today. It feels good. Try it!Even do the favor for yourself - clean your room, clean your mind, clean yourself from the people who bring you down, clean out the anxiety by replacing it with gratitude - even these \"selfish\" five minute favors are seeds you plant in the world.A few years ago I was doing business with \"a taker\". Every time we finished the negotiation and I got the term sheet, there were always more things on the term sheet that were against me and for him. Stuff that we had never agreed to.And ALWAYS at the last minute, when I was desperate to get a deal done, he would switch terms and make them massively against me.Finally, on our third deal together, where I had made zero money and he had made a lot, I said enough is enough and I stopped dealing with him.He ended up doing a deal with a super genius who I really liked. I even warned the super genius to be careful but since I wanted nothing to do with it, I backed off. But I let him know he could always call me for help.Well, fast forward six years. The deal between the taker and the super-genius fell apart pretty quickly. The taker is dead broke and living on life support.The super genius took a three hour train ride with his kids to find me for five minutes and ask me if I could be involved in his company. I was on the way to Claudia\\'s yoga class. I said I wanted to be honest with him and that I didn\\'t think I had the time but he was happy to call me any time to get free help.But he insisted I get more involved and he described what he was doing. It was incredible. I liked it. So I said yes. Then I asked him if he would go for breakfast. He said \"no\" he had to go and he turned around and took the three hours of trains back. He just needed to find me to convince me to say \"yes\".That\\'s because I did a five minute favor for him six years ago.And now hopefully, over the next decade or so, he can save the world.Giver, Taker, Matcher - which one are you?(Photo by Tim Greene)---[Please tell me below all the different types of five minute favors. Let\\'s build up a library of them. ]]',\n",
       "  70: '[Before I tell you about my date who smoked crack and got messages from dead people on TV sets I want to say that I don\\'t write about \"self-help\".I think that is a BS industry. It\\'s hard enough to help ourselves, let alone help others.Most of the time, every day is a battle against the things that will take us down. I\\'ve fallen so much I\\'ve come up with a comprehensive catalog of the nine ways you can destroy your life.As long as you avoid these nine things, you will jump from rock to rock across the pond and make it to the other side.Don\\'t do them:(1) SICKNESSSometimes it\\'s not your fault if your sick. But, don\\'t fool yourself - most of the time it\\'s 100% your fault.When my stomach hurts it might mean I was too stressed the day before. Or it might mean too much popcorn at the movies. Or too much to drink last night.Too little sleep is linked to sickness. It turns out that too much lying is linked to more complaining about health.You can make many choices to prevent sickness or improve health. You already know what they are. You don\\'t need to read them in a book.(2) INERTIAWhen I go to a networking dinner, many of the people talk about the books they have no time to write. The dinner might go until midnight. No wonder they have no time to write their books.About a year ago Morgan Spurlock was filming a series for Showtime about \"The Seven Deadly Sins\". They called me up and wanted to follow me around for a day for their segment on \"Greed\".I told them \"Ok\" but my day is pretty boring: I read, I write, I walk, I make some phone calls, I read some more, eat, sleep.They never called me back.I was talking to David Levien on my podcast a few weeks ago (hasn\\'t aired yet). He told me how he commuted into work and he would look around and everyone would be reading the NY Post or sleeping. \"I didn\\'t want this to be a dead end for me,\" he said. He got depressed about it.So he took out his computer and started writing every day on the commute.A chapter a day. In a year he had his novel done. \"City of the Sun\". It became a bestseller. While everyone else was sleeping all around him. His fourth novel in the series comes out in March.(3) DOUBTSI started a company, Stockpickr, in 2006. For some reason I did not do any competitive research. I just assumed my site was the only site.It turned out I had about five competitors, some significantly more advanced than mine. I started to cry. I didn\\'t know what to do.But I knew I had more passion for the project and more knowledge than any of my competitors but I was very afraid they would \"defeat\" me.When you pour your soul into something, it turns a tea of boiling water into nuclear energy.I have never doubted since then that when I pour everything I have into a project that it will turn into a nuclear project. If I write down ten ideas on how to make my business better, then it will become better. Eight months later I sold that business. All of my competition went out of business.(4) LAZINESSI did a podcast the other day with Dave Berg, who produced The Tonight Show for 20 years. I was really grateful he agreed to come on my podcast.He told me one of his favorite guests was Dennis Rodman. But often it was hard to get Rodman into the actual studios. He told me one time Rodman was supposed to be on the show but the day before he was doing some event in Nashville.So Dave flew to Nashville that day but then he lost track of where Rodman was. It turns out Rodman went out to Las Vegas and forgot to take Dave with him. So Dave flew to Las Vegas and then LA. Rodman made it to the show.Dave Berg got amazing guests on Jay Leno\\'s show for 20 years not by sending out a bunch of emails every day and saying, \"Well, I did the best I could.\"He actually DID the best he could. (5) CARELESSNESSOne time my agent pitched a book to a publisher I really wanted to work with.She said no.I said to him, take her out to lunch and ask her why. He hung up. Then he called me back and said, \"if you ever tell me what to do again then that\\'s the last conversation we have.\"It turned out that\\'s the last conversation we ever had.He had been my agent for about a decade. He had made a lot of money because of me and this was the first time he was talking back to me.So I called the publisher and explained why this was the perfect book for her. I went up to her offices. She told me why she said, \"no\". I rewrote the whole proposal. I submitted again. She said, \"yes\".You get careless when you don\\'t check every angle. When you get carved into a routine that is destined to be a road to nowhere.My agent will disappear with his industry. Maybe he\\'ll find something he loves doing. But he won\\'t do it by being careless.(6) VACILLATINGI wasted two years of my life once. HBO offered me a job and I didn\\'t feel ready to take it. I thought I had to write a novel. To \"be that guy\" who wrote a novel.Note: I was applying for a programmer position.So I waited two years, never published a novel, and then finally went for the job.There\\'s no right or wrong decisions. There\\'s just decisions. You either make them or you wait to make them. And while you are waiting, everything in your life goes on hold.(7) NO PROGRESSI started a dating site once. Or twice. Many times actually. I had this obsession with starting a dating site. I think it was a perverse sexual fantasy that I wanted to help two people meet each other and eventually have sex with each other.In any case, I never made any progress on any of these sites. I always had this dream that I\\'d launch a website and the traffic would be so big that the servers would shut down.That did happen to me once. With a finance site. And with my blog. But I never had so much traffic that a dating site would work. When there\\'s no forward motion I shut it all down pretty quickly.Why not? If you are writing down ten ideas a day there are many more things to explore.Don\\'t try to dig a well where there\\'s no water underneath.(8) DELUSIONSOne time I went out on a date with someone I had just met. It was really the worst type of date one could imagine.For one thing, I didn\\'t know that she was really into crack.For another thing, I didn\\'t know that she received messages from dead people through TV screens.I left that date pretty quickly when she was screaming at the TV in her hotel room.That\\'s an extreme case. Every day I get business plans from people who think their business is the one business that will change the world forever. I got a plan the other day that was a social network for dead people. That\\'s an example.Most people fall for a cognitive bias called \"Sunk cost bias\" where because they\\'ve already invested a lot of energy into something, then it must be the greatest business possible.Always take a step back and make sure you aren\\'t deluded. Are you solving an urgent problem for someone in a scalable fashion and is it showing forward progress.Or, in a relationship, how many people do you know who are going out with men or women who are unavailable? Fact: 95% of relationships that start off with one person betraying another don\\'t work out.Don\\'t be deluded. (9) FALLING BACKWARDSI was talking on my podcast with Brian Koppelman, who wrote Rounders and Oceans 13 and, my favorite, Solitary Man. He told me that he had been having trouble grappling with some issues while writing Solitary Man.This is where he could\\'ve fallen backwards and stopped writing one of my favorite movies ever.Instead, he found a safety net where he could play out his ideas and work through his issues. He started doing stand up comedy. Then he finished the movie.If a business is going bad: if you are losing clients or key employees, you can give up. That\\'s ok. But have your safety net. Your plan B.Know that you can still do something productive and this will see you through to the other side, rather than caving in to feelings of failure and misery and \"Why me?\"Writing ten ideas down every day, being healthy, being grateful and giving to others, will always give you the safety net where you can fall and then bounce higher than you\\'ve ever been before.As Tony Robbins said on my podcast with him, \"if you ask lousy questions, you get lousy answers\". \"Why me?\" Is a lousy question.When you feel yourself falling backwards, remember that you are the average of the five people you surround yourself with.But even more important, remember that you are the average of the five thoughts you have throughout the day. You can choose \"anger\" or \"gratitude\". You can choose \"regret\" or \"what did I learn?\" You can choose, \"I give up\" or you can try standup comedy for awhile.---The easiest way to help yourself is to just don\\'t hurt yourself. Nobody can do this but you. This is the meaning of \"choose yourself\". Nothing else.Later, I\\'m going to go to the supermarket. I like watching all the people. Beautiful people. Ugly people. People with stories.Each one of us was carved out a piece of universe that was given to us when we are born. All we have to do is carry it safety until the day we die. We have to protect that piece, to shine it each day so it can reflect and learn from everything that happens to us. Later we will all get to meet and put the pieces back together. We\\'ll all make something new and beautiful together.(Photo by Marc-Andre Lariviere)]',\n",
       "  71: '[One day a veteran commits suicide.I know this because my dad started a computer software business in 1970. I\\'m going to connect the dots because it involves a combination of coincidence and friendship.But first, why do veterans commit suicide? I have a 15 year old daughter. In 2.5 years, I guess, she is eligible to be in an army.Then she\\'s allowed to go into the army, get a gun, and go some place where she can shoot other 18 year old girls who have guns. I am never going to be for this.War has never brought about peace. Only peace can bring peace.Because I believe this I have lost some friends. Some friends are horrified that I\\'m against the US participation in WW II (despite the fact that many pacifists in the US during those times were rabbis).Other friends are horrified that I\\'m against the Civil War (they think it\\'s the same as me saying I\\'m \"for slavery\" which is ridiculous).I won\\'t argue against them. To be honest, I\\'m not smart enough. Every argument I bring up, they have a counterargument.The biggest way to prevent yourself from making your dreams come true is to argue about politics. Politics is the graveyard of dreams.When people argue with me about war I just ask them if they would take my daughter\\'s place if she ever had to go. Nobody has yet said yes.My dad started a software company that went public in the 1980s. It traded under the symbol CNSO and then eventually disappeared when his sales went to zero and he went bankrupt and spent most of the rest of his life crying with massive depression.About a decade ago I became friends with a very inspirational guy over the age of 80. In some way, he became like a father figure to me.We\\'d have breakfast once a month and he would tell me his stories.He told me he started his career at the age of 45. He wanted to be a venture capitalist instead of going door to door as an insurance salesman. He had no money in the bank at the time.He called up another investor at the time (the early 70s) and asked if he was doing the right thing. The investor he called, Warren Buffett, told him that he was making a big mistake and the country was going into a recession.Buffett was right and my friend struggled for awhile. \"James,\" he said, \"I was basically broke and had no idea what I was doing.\"And then he made a small investment in a company (I think it was the company that became Caremark) that turned into $60,000,000 a few years later. And then he kept making more and more good investments. And now he\\'s in his 80s and has given about $500 million in charity.He told me once about a company he was going to invest in. I think it\\'s worth noting he always flies coach. \"James,\" he said, \"when people are diagnosed with depression it takes them on average eight years to find the right drug to cure them.\"Psychiatrists can\\'t tell if you have depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar, etc etc. So they prescribe one drug after another and usually it takes months to figure out if that drug is working. Often, patients give up. For the ones who stay, it can take eight years to find the right drug for them.Many veterans come back with some form of PTSD or anxiety or depression. It\\'s too much, what they\\'ve seen.My friend was getting involved with a company that has a database of brain scans of people who have been successfully treated with a mental illness.They then take a veteran\\'s brain scan and match it to the database. They look at the closest match, see what drug worked, and prescribe that drug to the returning veteran. All of the studies show significant results in the treatment.What\\'s the stock symbol, I asked my friend.When he told me, I thought it sounded familiar. Out of 8000 public companies it turned out to be the same stock symbol, CNSO, as my dad\\'s old company. My dad who basically died of depression.So I invested a little in the company. Who knows if it will work out or not. I have no idea, to be honest. I admit it, \"coincidences\" are a part of my investment strategy.There\\'s something beautiful about a coincidence. As if the universe itself was an artist and you are the beautiful stroke of a paintbrush across an infinitely massive canvas.When I first met Claudia, on our third date she was waiting for me in a bookstore. She decided to find one of my books while she was waiting for me.She picked up a book that six months earlier (that apparently nobody bought) I had signed as a joke when I went into that bookstore.I was standing next to my daughter when i signed the book six months earlier and my daughter even said when she looked at what I wrote, \"Daddy, what the heck are you doing?\" I had never been in that bookstore before.Six months before I met Claudia I had signed that book, \"I love you\" and then signed my name. I didn\\'t sign any other books that way out of the 1000 or so books I had signed around the city.Claudia had randomly picked that bookstore to meet at. She went looking for my books, found one among four or five that had never sold, and then opened it up and the first thing she saw was, \"I love you\", in my handwriting. When you believe in coincidences it\\'s amazing how quickly you find them. And how fun life gets.Yesterday, for instance, I was in a Whole Foods in Florida (I live in New York) and I ran into someone I hadn\\'t seen in 15 years who lives in San Francisco. BAM! Inside of most of us is a little kid. And little kids often live in a world where magic is real. I feel that a chapter in my life will be over when I stop believing in that magic.I don\\'t know what coincidence will happen to me today. But I know it will happen. And I will close my eyes and enjoy the ride where it takes me.(Photo by Olivia Jones)]',\n",
       "  72: '[Jay Jay French, lead guitarist founder of the band Twisted Sister, told me how after they sold 20 million albums in the 80s, he was so broke and bankrupt that he had to take a job as a stereo salesman at a store.\"I was also thinking about being a checkout guy at the grocery store.\"\"I\\'d go install stereos and people\\'s houses and I\\'d see our records on the shelves and I wouldn\\'t even say anything to them about who I was. I didn\\'t want to be a sob story\".\"But, can I ask...did you ever sob during those times?\"He laughed. \"Oh yeah.\"He started the band in 1973 and then they first broke up when he walked in on the lead singer at the time aiming a gun at the drummer. \"I thought I was about to witness a murder,\" he said.Jay Jay hasn\\'t had anything to drink since 1970. He met Dee Snider, who became the lead singer, who also never drank or did drugs.They kept it clean and that\\'s a critical advantage they\\'ve had over the other bands. \"40 years later,\" Jay Jay told me, \"we\\'re the only band where all 5 members have been together for over 30 years without a change.\"The band still tours, filling an average of 60,000 people per appearance.\"The version of the band you see now changed 11 times in the first few years.\"They changed everything to find the right people. Who you are with, knowing that you can trust the people around you, is the most important decision you make every day. Whether it\\'s a wife, your mentors, your colleagues, the people you do deals with.Who you choose is more important than what you do.They were filling out local bars but they couldn\\'t get a record deal. Finally, they got a deal, they got airplay, they got on MTV, they sold 20,000,000 albums and the rest is history. Until...Until they went bankrupt. Until Jay Jay had to take a job selling stereos.\"I had to learn to reinvent myself,\" he said, \"and you never see someone reinventing themselves when they are on the top of their game.\"He sold stereos for three years before a band I never heard of signed him on to produce their album. That band went on to sell 6 million albums. \"I made more money than I ever did with Twisted Sister.\"Then he reformed the band, he started licensing the song, \"We\\'re Not Gonna Take It\" and they started touring. \"That one song is the most licensed song of the 80s. It\\'s crazy all the people who are licensing that song. Almost every political movement has licensed that song. Some of them try to not even pay but we always get them.\"\"If you could change one thing,\" I asked him, \"what would you change.\"I knew what he was going to say. He was going to say \"Nothing\". I even heard the \"N\" sound coming out of his mouth so I said, \"And don\\'t say \\'Nothing\\'. Pretend you are giving advice to a 25 year old exactly like you.\"\"Always do what you say you\\'re going to do.\" He described one transaction where a guy providing lighting for his tour gave him a deal on the lights but trusted him to make payments every week.\"He told me, \\'this is just a verbal agreement and you can break it but then you\\'re the guy who broke his word to me\\' and the guy was the biggest lighting guy in the industry. I didn\\'t break my word and I still don\\'t and that\\'s why the band is still together 40 years later.\"I asked him about when he was doing nothing, when the band had gone bust, when he had lost everything. He could\\'ve ended up doing nothing for the rest of his life.\"I followed one simple thing: I wrote down ten things I always wanted to do and then I started back from the beginning and built up. I always knew stereos and I always loved music so I started selling stereos.\"Within three years he produced a record, and now two decades after that he\\'s made millions from licensing \\'We\\'re Not Gonna Take It\\'.\\nDon\\'t be afraid to start from the beginning. Again and again.\\nAlways do what you say you\\'re going to do.\\nBe healthy and pick your team to be with people of similar values and health.\\nLove what you do. Twisted Sister went ten years performing before they found a label.\\n\"Why did you even need a label?\"\"We were selling out to crowds of 5000-10,000,\" he said, \"so we were making money. But at that time you couldn\\'t go national without a label. Now it\\'s different but then there was no way.\"In those ten years they performed 6000 times. He described to me all the disappointments they had along the way. And then that night they would perform again. Being that guy.The one who does the work no matter what, with the people you chose to work with, being willing to reinvent if necessary, being willing to come back.I get emails every day that say, \"I\\'m 27 and feel like a failure because I haven\\'t done anything.\"And then I talk to Jay Jay French. The man who couldn\\'t take it. But did.(Photo by Christophe Ochal)]',\n",
       "  73: '[I was fired. I asked for one more week to finish what I was working on but my boss said, \"No. Clear out of here in the next hour.\"I don\\'t know why I was fired. Other people weren\\'t. But I think my boss didn\\'t like me.So I got depressed. I was going to run out of money, all my friends were going back to graduate school (I had been thrown out the semester before), and at the end of that summer my girlfriend broke up with me.The entire reason I stayed in Pittsburgh that summer was because of my girlfriend. I had a job offer at IBM but I had turned it down (it was to work on the chess computer \"Deep Blue\").I also felt rejected. Like nobody was going to care if I died.I was trying to get a novel published but that was going nowhere. I got rejected by over 40 or 50 agents. And it wasn\\'t one of those things where I got a note that said, \"Keep at it, kid. You got talent.\" All I got were form letters.I stopped bathing. What for? I didn\\'t leave my apartment. One time some friends rang my doorbell and when I answered they said, \"Oh!\" And then they left.My dad offered to drive up to where I was and just take me home. \"Maybe you need to rest for awhile\". Thinking about it makes me sad because now he\\'s dead and perhaps I should\\'ve taken him up on his offer.When you\\'re a parent you realize all the missed opportunities you had with your parent.My sister gave me advice, \"just do one thing a day\". So I would do that. I gave chess lessons. I would try to write one page a day. I would read. I would apply for a job.I really wanted to work at the local comic book store but they wouldn\\'t hire me. \"This is not really a profitable business,\" the owner told me. He was nice about it.But on my podcast, 20 years later, almost all of my guests says that the key to success is \"Show up every day\" which is similar to the advice my sister gave me when I was at a low point.I think Adam Carolla said it to me while he was washing dishes during my podcast. Very efficient. \"Show up every day\".I hate when someone gives me work to do. But lately I\\'ve realized that showing up every day actually gives me less work to do.It doesn\\'t mean \"Show up ALL DAY\". It just means, \"Show up\". It could take ten minutes. It could take an hour. But if you do it, then you did your showing up for today.How can you show up today? Connect two people.A friend of mine, Nicole Lapin, is coming out with a book in two months. I introduced her to another friend of mine, Ryan Holiday, to help her market her book. They agreed to work together.How does this help me? It doesn\\'t. But it was me showing up for them. That upgrades the quality of my network and everyone benefits in the long run. Write every day.This is the one thing I\\'ve been doing every day for 20 years. We live through our emails, our texts, our sales presentations, our ability to tell a story.If you can\\'t write today (because maybe you are showing up in one of the other ways listed here) just make sure you have it in your arsenal. Write once a week or once a month. Share something. Claudia is preparing a class on curing back pain using yoga.It used to be, you had to give the class to share what you learned. But now you can slice it in so many ways.For instance, she doesn\\'t have to put the whole class online today. She can simply share the reading list she used when creating the class. Keep track of every part of your process. Many slices make up an entire sandwich and they are all tasty.If you can\\'t figure out what to share I have an idea for you. Take a picture of the most interesting person you see today and post it. That\\'s all you have to do today to \"Show up\". The 100 Day Rule.This is Joey Coleman \\'s excellent rule for keeping customers. Call them every day for the first 100 days and they become a customer for life.I\\'m applying the rule in a different way. I\\'ve recently made an investment. I\\'m calling the founder every day (I hope I don\\'t annoy him too much) to learn more about what he does and to hopefully help him in the areas I am good at.I will do this for 100 days and see if it works in investment relationships as well. It\\'s just one phone call. It\\'s probably the only phone call I will make today. Three emails.A friend of mine has a startup that is doing pretty well. With a startup there are so many things trying to grab your attention: getting customers, servicing customers, developing technology, raising money, dealing with administrative stuff.Sometimes you don\\'t know what to do or where to focus on. It feels overwhelming.I suggested to my friend to do what I do: I send three \"business\" emails a day. So maybe he can send to one potential investor and two potential clients. That\\'s over 1000 emails a year to help build your business.If you have a good business then good things will come from this.For me, I usually send out emails to three potential podcast guests. Three a day means 90 a month. Even with a 10% response rate I\\'ll get nine great guests a month and it\\'s worked.For some people this might mean look into three job possibilities a day. Or say \"thanks\" to three people you work with today and tell them why. This is showing up. Take yourself on a date.When I was at a low point in 2008 I lived next door to a museum. I would go to the museum and sit in the bookstore/cafe and read. Then sometimes I\\'d walk through the museum and look at the art. I had to take care of myself because I was very depressed.At my worst points, I find it very hard to connect with people. Art is like a secret part of our brain where we can all connect and share the parts of ourselves where language is not enough.There. If you were fired yesterday, just show up today. If you have to get something done at work, just show up. If you have to write, just write a paragraph, or write about the three people you sent emails to today. If you\\'re sick or someone close to you is very sick then do something that will add a tiny bit to their health.When a relative was sick with cancer I would visit the hospital with a deck of cards and poker chips and we\\'d play cards for a few hours. I couldn\\'t do anything else to help him.When we die our entire legacy is simply the added together strengths of all the connections we make with others. This is the ghost of ourselves we leave behind. This is showing up.If you show up every day for 365 days you will look back and be amazed at how much you did, even if it was just one thing a day.I wrote this. I showed up.(Photo by Mike Hyde)]',\n",
       "  74: '[It feels really crazy good to make out with someone, doesn\\'t it? Remember the first time you did that? Amazing!My first thought was: why didn\\'t anyone ever tell me it was going to feel this good?Ok, I just had to get that off my chest. Now for some serious stuff: like quitting, going broke, stealing, lying, and maybe even killing someone.In 2012 I wrote a popular article called \"10 Reasons You Have to Quit Your Job in 2012\". It got over a million views.In 2013 I wrote a popular article called \"10 Reasons You Have to Quit Your Job in 2013\". It got about two million views on the various sites I posted it on.In 2014, I wrote an insanely popular article called \"10 Reasons You Have to Quit Your Job in 2014.\" It\\'s now in the top 10 articles of all time on LinkedIn.Did you quit your job? If so, you can skip the rest of this article. Go find someone to make out with. If you\\'ve never done that before I can tell you it feels really good.The world is divided into angry people and free people.Anger is a subset of fear. Maybe you are afraid to be lonely. Or afraid to be broke. Or afraid to die?In 1994, 2001, 2005, 2008, and 2010 I was so angry and scared I didn\\'t know what to do.I thought I had to have a purpose, a goal. But this is BS.There is only ONE purpose: TO BE FREE.There are layers of freedom.FIRST LAYER: Free from your own past and future. Which means: free of all regrets and petty hatreds from the past and anxieties and worries about the future.This is very hard. I have to practice this every day. When you practice something, you get better.For instance, I\\'m angry at someone who wrote me an angry email a year or so ago. That is petty. And he or she has his own fears. His own insecurities.Freedom is a daily practice. If you get 1% better every day at freedom then you become not just free but an explorer. Explore as much as possible before your last breath.#2: The next layer of freedom is to be free of other people\\'s opinions of you. You never ride above the clouds if everyone is holding you down into the rain.One time I ran into a co-worker who gave her opinion about something I was about to do at work: \"you CAN\\'T do that. Nobody does that.\" She still works there and is still unhappy. 20 years later. Another time several years ago someone wrote an article being somewhat cruel to me and taking things out of context.At first I was really bothered. I actually cried and said, \"why did he do this?\" We had been friends and he twisted it. There\\'s no answer. I had to give up trying to answer everyone else\\'s fears.#3: The next layer: be free of the opinions of the masses.While everyone is wearing surgical masks and staying indoors because of Ebola and the fate of the dollar you can be outside enjoying the sun.Everyone jumps on the latest trend. That trend gets weighed down by all the people jumping up and down on it.Don\\'t look towards the future for trends. Look towards the past. What worked before? Do it 10 times better.PayPal is a great example. People have been paying each other for centuries. But with cash or credit. Paypal was 10x better. How about paying someone via email?#4: The next layer: be free of the word \"CAN\\'T\".I need to explain that one. Let\\'s say I\\'m interested in basketball. I\\'m not going to be a professional basketball player.Realistically, I can\\'t be one.Primarily because I\\'m 46 years old. Otherwise I would definitely be one, no question about it.But I CAN write a novel about basketball. I can be an agent. I can work for a team. I can be a marriage counselor for pro basketball players. I can be a referee. I can design homes with basketball courts inside of them.Don\\'t think of an interest as a goal. Then you will spend your life with \"CAN\\'T\" as your lover. Think of your interest as a theme.DO THIS TECHNIQUE:a. I draw on a big piece of paper the names of all the themes I am interested in. games, writing, art, business, stocks, entrepreneurship, psychology, health, rap music, podcasts, TV, comic books, comedy, etc.b. I make a bunch of dots of what I can do with all of these themes. One dot might be \"write a novel\". Another dot might be \"start a podcast\". Another might be \"start a food truck\".c. Then I draw lines between the dots to connect them in various ways. Label each line. A line between games and psychology. Well, I can write about the psychology of a good game player and how that relates to business.Suddenly I have 100 careers to choose from. And guess what? I\\'m allowed to choose more than one. Nobody can stop me. I CAN do that.#5: The next layer of freedom: find someone who likes what you are doing.A standard technique in Internet business is to give away great value for free.Because then you get people to know who you are and like what you stand for. Steve Scott puts up a ton of free slideshares on how to build good habits.But then he writes a new book every three weeks about building good habits. In just a few years he went from making $0 a month writing books to making $60,000 a month writing books and newsletters about habits.He\\'s not an exception. I know 100 other people doing this at least.#6: Now that people like something you are doing, start thinking of something you can charge for. A premium version of what you are doing.If you\\'ve never done this before, it feels overwhelming at first. I have a friend, Molly Hahn, who emails out doodles she makes every morning.Every doodle has a Buddha character in it and a quote. How the hell is someone who does that going to make a living? She emails out free doodles of Buddhas.This past year she made a six figure income selling things in her online doodle store.I have a Buddha carpet, for instance. It\\'s beautiful. I lie down on it throughout the day. She figured out what to give out for free and what to charge for. She\\'s not an exception. She RULES.#7: Another layer of freedom: ONLY do your best work 2-5 hours after you wake up.We are only at peak productivity two to five hours after we wake up. Here\\'s what I do: I read for the first two hours after I wake up and then I write.After that I might still work, but mostly just followups and phone calls. Then I make out with people.#8: You don\\'t need a lot to live like a king.It feels great when all of your bills are paid. It feels even better when you know you are doing something that will pay your bills for a long time.If all you do is that then you are in great shape. If all you need is \"enough\" then you are the king of the world.#9: Freedom is a path you choose every day.When everyone else is afraid they are \"stuck\", it\\'s great to know that you are on your path to freedom.It takes years or even decades to be in your full stride so don\\'t punish yourself if you are not \"there\" yet, wherever \"there\" is.When I interviewed the rapper Coolio he told me it took him 17 years of writing every day before he had a single hit. But he was free to do it every day. Then he wrote one of the bestselling songs of all time. \"I\\'m going to make money off of that one song for the rest of my life,\" he told me.When I interviewed the standup comedian Jim Norton he told me it took him 6 years before he was making a living as a comedian. Now he\\'s one of the most successful comedians in the world, 20 years later.Do your themes every day because you love doing them. Remember that persistence + love = abundance. But persistence is measured in years, not days, not months. Go back to #1 when you forget this.#10: Final freedom layer: Realize that everyone you meet today has been sent down from an alien mother ship to teach you a lesson. Learn those lessons.This sounds like I\\'m making it up but it\\'s true. Nobody will admit this of course. But trust me, it\\'s true.If all you do is this layer of freedom, then nothing can ever stop you from living the best possible life.I know billionaires who don\\'t do that final step and they are miserable every day. They even get to make out with a lot of people and are still miserable. Angry. So they try to make more money and they get angrier. Then they die.If you do any of the above, have a little celebration. Put a candle on a cupcake. Love yourself.Take a break from asking \"why me?\". Instead say \"wow\".Go from \"Why?\" to \"Wow!\"Good luck and good night.(Photo by Anthony Citrano)]',\n",
       "  75: '[Barnett Newman\\'s painting, \"Black Fire 1\" sold for $84 million even though your five year old could\\'ve done it.He was never able to teach art because he would often fail the basic drawing classes that schools would make teachers pass.When I started writing blog posts one of the first tweets I saw, from a good friend of mine, was \"this is like watching a train wreck in slow motion\".I would write about what I did when I was dead broke. I would write about peeing face down on the ground while cars swerved around me.I would write about throwing a coconut on the ground in the middle of NYC on the advice of a psychic so I could make all my money back. I was scared. I was scared shirtless.People who came out of the financial world weren\\'t supposed to do that. It was embarrassing.People still write me with the worst garbage. I love how people take valuable time out of their day to tell me what a horrible person I am. Sometimes it bothers me I have to admit.Sometimes people know the right button to press. But it gives me an opportunity to focus on the emails I get that tell me how my stories have helped them. I\\'m very grateful for that. I hope it never stops.Why is Barnett Newman art? He has one painting that is all red but a light orange strip (he called it the \"zip\") going right through it. He divided the art world from the word of meaning, to the world of meaningless.Aging is like that. We start off with ambition. \"I\\'m going to DO something\". We end with meaning: \"I\\'m going to help others.\"Some pain, a bandaid covering a deep wound, divided the two.I\\'m not an artist. I try to write as well as possible, like many people. And sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn\\'t.So because I\\'m not an artist at all I\\'m going to write what I think it is. Because nobody can stop me. There are no rules.1) DEFIANCESaying something that divides the world into a \"B\" and an \"A\". Before you said it and After you said it.You make people think that the world was upside down from what they thought before.Everyone divides the world into what is possible what is not possible. Art is when you make people think more is possible than they could have possibly imagined.2) BEAUTYIt doesn\\'t mean physical beauty. Our thoughts are like the tip of an iceberg.When Amanda Palmer was just starting out she would dress up like a bride and silently hand anyone a flower who gave her a dollar.When you look at a bride, frozen on the street, wearing white makeup, her eyes looking at you, it brings up thoughts. What is a bride? What is love? What is the connection right now between me and her.What is the loneliness we can never quite shake and here is a hand willing to reach out to us with a flower for just a dollar.To put your finger on someone\\'s loneliness, even for a second, is art. It\\'s a massage of the heart.3) CONNECTIONOn every website I see articles like \"10 Ways to Get a Job\" and the article usually gives very practical advice. I think the authors can improve these stories.The more blood in the article, the better the article is. The more you tell your story, the deeper the well people can drink from.Most people give advice freely. But they forget to tell their story.When you do that, you let people sip from your dirty hand but you don\\'t let them drink from the well of your life.4) A NEW WAY TO LOOK AT THINGSMichael Jackson made a song about gang violence. Weird Al took the exact same song and made it about finishing your dinner.Al showed that meaning can be twisted and still enjoyed. Gang violence is important. But so is an ability to look at the same thing and have fun with it.Andy Warhol made a painting of a Campbell\\'s Soup can. Can any child do it? Of course. Why was Warhol art? You might think it wasn\\'t. Others might say he was the first to really underline the commercialization of art. A before and after way of looking at things.5) THE TRUTHColleen Ballinger saw all of her classmates put up videos on YouTube while singing or performing. They all thought they were going to become discovered on YouTube and then suddenly rich and famous. She thought they were untalented idiots.So she put on sloppy bright red lipstick. She clipped her hair back in the ugliest way possible. She began giving completely arrogant lessons on how to perform. She messed up all her words while pretending not to realize it.And she (performing as \"Miranda Sings\") gets about 8 million views per youtube video and is performing all over the country now.The truth is: silliness is art. Seriousness can lead to disappointment.Jerry Seinfeld had her on his show. At one point he was frustrated with her constant complaining. He said, \"I thought I was helping your career by having you on here.\"She said, \"What!? I thought I was helping you!\"That\\'s art.6) COMBINATIONEveryone looks at Jackson Pollack paintings and says \"I can do that\". But can they? Maybe they can.Jackson Pollack took his whole body, took other materials and not just paint, took down the canvas and put it flat on the floor and used his body to fling paint and other objects all over the canvas.He created a new form of art combining painting, abstract expressionism, sculpture, dance, Jungian philosophy, and defined his own category of art.He was just as insecure as anyone else. He was afraid he was going to go out of fashion. He took on a mistress. He had problems with alcoholism. He died (and killed a passenger) while driving drunk one night.And yet the energy he brought to what he did, the combination of history and future and movement and sculpture and paint makes him one of the greatest artists of the past century.He combined with energy and passion. More than anyone else before him.7) FEARWhen you make art, you\\'re striking out on a path that is totally new. Don\\'t do it unless it\\'s new.Why is this scary? People might hate you. People might resent you. People will make fun of you. People will call you trash. People will say \"why is this even here?\" People deny you opportunities and money.Vincent Van Gogh died broke. Kafka died broke. The list goes on. If you do what you love, you can\\'t do it with the hope of obtaining something.You have to do it with a sense of surrender. You\\'re doing it because your body and mind want to do it, not because your wallet wants to do it.Fear brings humility. Fear brings gratitude from you to the people who admire what you are doing.Why would you want to do something that makes you afraid? Because art again comes from that sense of connection that we have with the rest of the human herd. It\\'s a way at a deep level we can communicate with others.That connection feeds us more than any dollars will.Right now in New Mexico there is a radar waiting for signals from outerspace. They may never get a signal. Or it may take 100s of years. We don\\'t know.We all feel sometimes like we are from deep in empty outerspace. We just want to send out a signal that someone will listen to and respond to. If you aren\\'t afraid, then you aren\\'t doing it right.8) CRAZYI erased this entire section when editing. 9) LAUGHTERWhy not? If you can give an adult 5 more reasons to laugh today then you just made their life 100% better.10) MESS UPWhat do I know about art? Who am I to comment on it? Nobody. I am an absolute nobody. It\\'s arrogant and foolish. BLAH!I am someone who thinks everyone has the latent ability to quit their job and become king of their worlds. That\\'s what I believe. That\\'s my evil plan.To get everyone to celebrate their abilities and quit their job and make millions. I believe that you can do that.What is art?When your chest and your heart and your mind are all on fire and you feel like a god just kissed you.(Photo by Nick Southall)]',\n",
       "  76: '[Roy Raymond was a sad pervert. He\\'d buy bras and panties at the department store and all the clerks thought their thoughts about him.Roy felt embarrassed. He wasn\\'t really a pervert. He just wanted to buy lingerie for his girlfriend.So he solved this major problem he was having. He created a space where men could feel comfortable coming in and buying sexy lingerie for their partners. He called it Victoria\\'s Secret.But Roy, by solving this important personal issue for himself, apparently solved the same issue for many other men. First year sales were over $500,000 and he quickly opened up three more stores.In 1982 he sold Victoria\\'s Secret for one million dollars before trying multiple other businesses that ended up failing. One MILLION Dollars. A decade later Victoria\\'s Secret was worth over a billion dollars but Roy Raymund was nearly bankrupt and had missed the huge run-up in it\\'s value.Picture New York City in the late 1800s on a rainy day. It was disgusting beyond belief. 150,000 horses transported people up and down the busy streets. Each of those horses, according to Super Freakonomics, dropped down about 15-30 pounds of manure. That\\'s up to 4.5 million pounds of manure A DAY on the streets of NYC. And now imagine it raining.Would you cross the street?How long could this last? How long would the city survive without being infested with crap and all the diseases brought with it. What would happen as population of both men and horses increased?Was someone working on inventing a gigantic manure scooper? How would this problem get solved?It never got solved.Instead, Henry Ford invented the assembly line to mass produce cars. Every horse lost their job. People began to drive cars. Manure problem solved.In both cases there is a common theme. Someone outside the industry solved a problem that changed that industry forever. Roy Raymund wasn\\'t a fashion designer or a retailer. He worked in the marketing department of Vicks, which makes over the counter medications.Henry Ford, I don\\'t think, ever worked in the manure industry.Instead, each person focused on a problem that was important to them. A problem that excited them at that moment in time. Raymund wanted to avoid being embarrassed in the future. Ford wanted an efficient way to make cars.The ONLY way to change the world is to solve a problem that is important to YOU. They had to choose themselves for success before they could save the world. Raymund had to convince himself that he didn\\'t belong in the marketing department of a division of Procter &amp; Gamble. He borrowed $80,000 and took the big risk of starting a business. Ford had to survive numerous failures and bankruptcies in order to find a cheap way to make cars. He would abandon investors, people who supported him, and even companies named after him, in his quest to solve his problem in his own way. Nobody gave them permission. And neither of them set out to change the world. They only wanted to solve a problem that was personally important to them. It\\'s unfortunate that often we forget that choosing ourselves is not something that happens once. It has to happen every single day. Else we lose track of that core inside of us that solves problems and is able to share them in a way that makes the world a better place.Ford forgot this and became obsessed with Jews. Ford is the only American that Hitler mentions in Mein Kampf: \"only a single great man, Ford, [who], to [the Jews\\'] fury, still maintains full independence...[from] the controlling masters of the producers in a nation of one hundred and twenty millions.\" And what happened to our embarrassed marketing manager that has ignited the passions of men and women for the past 30 years?Roy Raymund saw the value of Victoria\\'s Secret jump from the one million he sold it for in 1982 to over a billion dollars a decade later. He failed in business after business. He got divorced. Then at the age of 46, my age, he drove to Golden Gate Bridge, jumped off it and killed himself.Before you can save the world you have to save yourself.But you have to relentlessly do it every day. Sometimes the train wakes me up at night and I feel scared. What will the world be like for my children? I won\\'t always be able to help them. I don\\'t even know if I do enough to help them now.And then I remember. I\\'m alive for another day.]',\n",
       "  77: '[Robbie Abed wanted to have coffee with me in 2011. Then in 2012 and 2013 and this year. I kept saying No.Robbie told me he has 250 coffee meetings a year.So in one way of thinking about it, I\\'m one in 250. And over a period of four years, I\\'m one in a thousand. So not so special.I don\\'t usually meet new people for coffee. I like to sit in my room and read and write and deal with business stuff. A few months ago I was on a three week vacation to Thailand one block from the beach and it took me two weeks to get to the beach.Robbie wrote to me and said, \"I\\'ll even come to where you are\". I live 80 miles north of NYC. I figured he was bluffing.So I said, \"ok, but I only have 15 minutes.\" Who is going to drive 1.5 hours to have coffee with me for 15 minutes and then drive 1.5 hours back to the city.He said, \"ok\". And I said, \"ok, meet me at 12:15 and I gave him the address, \"but I might be late\" because I had a podcast that started at 11.When my podcast was over, he was there. I didn\\'t want to have coffee. So I said, \"come back to my house and let\\'s do a podcast. He came back with me and Claudia and I did an \\'Ask Altucher\\' podcast with him, \"Why do you have 250 coffee meetings a year?\"He described that he was in a bad job situation he had several years ago but he had no network at all.He was scared. He wanted to go on his own but he was afraid to go broke.He wanted to figure out how to make connections. So he joined a networking group and then started having coffee with everyone in the group and asking them, \"how can I help you? Who can I introduce to you?\"This is a great question. About 50% of people consider themselves too shy to introduce themselves to other people. Maybe the real number is even higher. I consider myself a shy person. In a party I hide and just like to watch people.For Robbie, if someone said, \"I want to meet X.\" he would then try to have coffee with X, he\\'d mention that the other person wants to meet X and why. If X was agreeable, he\\'d make the introduction.I call this \"permission networking\". If you just introduce two people without their permission then you just contributed to ruining their lives.You outsourced the question of \"Why should these two people meet\" to them instead of solving the problem yourself.Many people don\\'t want to figure out why they should meet someone. They are already busy enough.Hence, everyone will hate you, the guy in the middle that gave them more work to do.Robbie described all the ways he benefited from these coffees.Sometimes he would and sometimes he wouldn\\'t. Some people would pay him and some would ignore him. But bit by bit, having 250 coffees a year allowed him to build a successful marketing business. THE 250 COFFEES A YEAR TECHNIQUE:\\nJoin a networking group, or have some other excuse to call people and tell them how you could potentially help them if they had a cup of coffee with you. \\nTry to learn at least one thing from them in the coffee. \\nResearch them in advance so you might be able to guess what their needs are.\\nFocus on the other person\\'s needs. \"How can I help you?\" \\nDo this 250 times a year.\\nFollow through. Be that guy.\\nStay out of the way and have no expectations.\\nOnly one out of 20 or even 50 is going to pay you but 100% of the people will remember you wanted to help them.This creates potential energy in your future. I know from experience that having a lot of potential energy has a way of working itself out in the long run, even decades.I don\\'t know what Robbie learned from me. But I learned enough from him to get a podcast out of it. I think I got the better deal.Garin Etcheberry has been sending me great ideas for awhile. He\\'s a machine.Yesterday he wrote a blog post on medium, \"How I Landed 5 Dream Jobs GIving out My Best Ideas for a Month\". He had written down 300 ideas in 30 days and sent them all out to people he wanted to help.Most didn\\'t respond. Some wrote back, \"thank you\".But, as he says in the title, he got 5 dream jobs. He never would have gotten them if he didn\\'t write down 10 ideas a day. Here\\'s his post: http://bit.ly/1EOn7RAIn the post he says, \"James told me to not stop. Keep sending ideas to people. he said. Youre already an idea muscle; send ideas to people every day and you cant fail to create wealth for yourself.\"THE DREAM JOB TECHNIQUE:\\nWrite down ten ideas for other people every day. Good ideas or bad. Do your research beforehand so the ideas are as good as possible. \\nSend them with no expectation of having any response back. \\nMost people will ignore you. Some people will say \"thank you\" (future potential) and 5 people will give you your dream job. BAM!\\nSomeone the other day wrote me, \"how do I give ideas out and make sure I get paid for them?\"If you are giving ideas with the expectation of getting paid for them then you aren\\'t really giving. I told him that. And this guy wrote back and said, \"but isn\\'t it a law of the universe that if you give, you can also take?\"The answer is \"no\", that\\'s an ugly way to look at the universe.As Robbie said to me, even if nothing happens, you keep in touch now. You send updates. You drop notes. When you plant a 1000 seeds, only a few might blossom.What Garin gave was the best gift of all - his blog post. He showed many people, without any expectation at all, how just giving ideas works to create abundance.Becoming an idea machine makes you an abundance generator.Now all I have to do is start implementing the ideas Garin has given ME.Before Robbie left my house he described someone who\\'s created an interesting model in the restaurant business. \"Whoah,\" I said, \"that\\'s pretty cool.\"It made me think, \"this person would be interesting for my podcast. What an innovative way to do restaurants.\"Within 40 minutes Robbie had reached out to the person, got his permission, and then sent an intro to the two of us.I looked back through my emails. I saw that Robbie wrote me in January 2011. He said, \"Thank you everything you\\'ve done for me\" even though I hadn\\'t done anything for him.I\\'m not even sure I responded to that one. Well Robbie, thank you for everything you\\'ve done for me.(Photo by chichacha)]',\n",
       "  78: '[[Here is the link to the podcast: http://bit.ly/1t8RJ80]When we got to Tony Robbins\\' house we were specifically prevented from photographing his sneakers. I took out the camera but his assistant shook her head. \"No\". Which made me feverish to take the picture even more but I didn\\'t.Everyone takes their shoes off. And all the other shoes were like normal human shoes. Then there were his sneakers.My business partner called me after we did our a major deal in 2004. I was about to go broke when we did this deal but we did it and it saved my life. My partner said, \"you\\'ll never guess what number I wrote down in 2001 after we both read \"Awaken the Giant Within\" \\' and of course I guessed correctly. It was the number we made in 2004.In 2001 he was ashamed to tell me. \"Guess who I am reading.\" And then we realized we were reading the same books. Both of Tony Robbins books. But they were written so long ago I kept going to the bookstore thinking Tony Robbins was going to have a new book out any day.Now Tony Robbins has a new book out today. For the first time in 25 years I think.Bill Clinton is the first blurb on the inside of his book (I ask him about that in his interview: \"Why does Bill Clinton even call you? What do you guys talk about?\")So I was really excited to fly down to his house in Florida and interview him a few weeks ago. It was like going down to visit a member of the X-Men.Claudia and I got to his house and his staff helped us set up our equipment and then we took a walk out to the ocean. It was beautiful. We felt lucky and relaxed.Then we went back inside. I told Claudia to start the recording before Tony even showed up. So we could pick up all idle chit chat. When Tony arrived we started talking and he said, \"this is good. We should record this\" and then he was laughed when Claudia said we were already recording.The book is called \"Money\" a topic I sometimes know a lot about and sometimes know nothing about. I ran hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, and have advised many money managers, often people managing billions of dollars.Tony took it one step further and interviewed the top money managers in the world, how they do what they do. He exposed many of the scams still on Wall Street. He gives simple advice that everyone can follow.We spoke for an hour. Here\\'s what I learned from the book and from talking to him. I\\'m mostly going to leave out the financial stuff. All of that is in the book: the scams, the ways to avoid them, the interviews with the amazing people he spoke with.Here\\'s what I personally learned.A) ASK LOUSY QUESTIONS, GET LOUSY ANSWERS.Many people say, \"Why did this have to happen to me?\" Or \"Why did I lose that job when I was good?\"These are lousy questions. You will never get an answer that makes your life better. I get bitter, resentful, angry. And anger is a form of fear. I\\'m usually afraid I\\'m going to go broke. And if I go broke, I\\'m afraid I die.You have to ask good questions: \"What can I do to improve?\" or \"How can I find a better job?\" or \"How can I be grateful that I lost this job?\"Because inside of every problem is the seeds of a \"difficult gratitude problem\" and it always improves your life to solve those problems.B) TO MASTER ANYTHING, TALK TO THE EXPERTS.Tony told us about a time when he was 24 years old and he wanted to train members of the military to shoot better.\"I had never shot a gun in my life,\" he said and laughed in his raspy voice. He was scared he wouldn\\'t do a good job.So how did he solve this problem? He spoke to five excellent sharpshooters, figured out what they all had in common, and then used that to increase the results of the students in the school by 50%.C) BRING THE TARGET CLOSER.Specifically, for every student he had them bring the target only a few feet away. Everyone shot bullseyes. Then he moved the target back a foot. Bullseyes. Then another foot. And so on.This is true for everything in life. I look at the example Mark Cuban told me. He didn\\'t just start Broadcast.com and make a billion. First he started a bar. Then he started a computer business. Then a hedge fund.He brought the target very close and then moved it further and further away as he succeeded at each thing.I thought about teaching my 12 year old how to serve in tennis. First I had her serve from the net. \"All you have to do is hit the ball into this huge box.\" Then when she got 10 in a row I had her move back a few feet until she hit the base line. Now she\\'s got the most consistent server on her team (I\\'m bragging).D) LOOK AT GOALS DIFFERENTLY.Tony told us of one time he asked people what their goals were. One guy said, \"I want to make a billion dollars!\" At first this would seem like an admirable goal - set it high! There\\'s that horrible saying, \"Aim for the moon, because even if you miss it you\\'ll find yourself among the stars.\"But Tony said, this guy didn\\'t really understand his goal.He broke it down. \"Why do you want a billion?\" And the first answer was, \"I want my own plane\". Tony told him, \"Well a plane costs $100 million and you might only be flying 12 times a year. If you charter a yet for $30,000 an hour then it will take you forever to spend $100 million.\" So suddenly the guy didn\\'t need $1 billion anymore. He needed $900 million.\"By the end of that session,\" Tony said, \"it turns out to achieve the exact lifestyle he thought he needed a billion for, he needed $10 million.\" This is still a lot of money but this was Tony\\'s way of bringing the target closer.When I read that in his book, I did the exercise with Claudia. Her numbers went down by 90% when we really went through it. What happens then? You feel relief. You don\\'t have to be on the hamster wheel of money for your whole life. What you want is freedom, not money.E) EXPERTS KNOW THEY KNOW NOTHING.All the time I get spam financial newsletters saying, \"The Markets are going to zero!\" or \"This stock is going to go up 1000%!\" The reality is the experts know zero. With every investment expert that Tony interviewed they not only had a plan B. They had a plan C, D, and E.The best professionals in the business admit they know nothing.Nobody can predict the future. Anything can happen. When I got out of the \"future\" business I was much happier. I got into the possibility business.This made me a lot more successful. Leave the future business for the possibility business and the world will get infinitely larger.F) HIS ENERGY IS INFECTIOUS.Somebody told me he jumps up and down on a trampoline before speaking in front of 10,000 people. He wants his energy at peak.I thought about doing that before my most recent TED talk but there was no trampoline available. But it\\'s true. When he came downstairs to talk to us he was very excited about the potential for his book to help people. It almost made me want to write about financial stuff again.After Claudia and I left his house (and, by the way, that\\'s a BIG house) we had so many ideas about creative things we could do we almost had to pull over and calm down. So we went to Cheesecake Factory and ate until we exploded.G) THE TONY ROBBINS METHOD.In the interview I said, \"Ok, I figured it out. You use \"the Tony Robbins Method\\'\". Which I defined as, 1. at first you don\\'t know anything 2. you find 5 people who are the experts in the world 3. you extensively interview them 4. you figure out the most simple things they have in common with each other 5. you do that simple thing over and over and over and over (repetition)And that\\'s how you succeed.H) PEOPLE NEED CERTAINTY. PEOPLE NEED VARIETY.Everyone needs to know where their next meal is coming from. And maybe their next kiss. And maybe...a bunch of things. We crave some stability, which was the appeal of corporate jobs for the past 100 years (although that period is now slowly coming to an end) and was the appeal of all these mutual fund ads that say, \"we return 9% a year\".But most of that stability is a lie. You have to find stability inside yourself first.For me, it\\'s stable to make money from multiple sources. To know that if I have ideas every day, then life will be more stable than if I don\\'t.But we also need variety. A marriage will die if you stick to the same routine year after year (\"the 7 year itch\"). A job will get boring. We only have one life. It doesn\\'t mean you quit your marriage or quit your job. But always look for new things to learn. Always look for new ways to surprise. Always look for new ways to break out of your comfort zone.It\\'s this dance of certainty and uncertainty that made us human and we often lean too much in one way or the other. But if you did that on the dance floor you\\'d fall over.Tony describes this in the book in a financial sense. His goal is to expose the lies in the financial community and get you thinking about how to provide stability there so you can find variety in other parts of your life.I) SHOW PEOPLE YOU ARE GRATEFUL.When we are very young we build strong neural circuits across our brains so that electricity can pass quickly between certain neurons. This is why it\\'s easier to learn when we are young then when we are older.After the age of 20, we lose the ability to \"insulate\" these neural circuits with myelin, the substance which cements these circuits for life. This is where our basic intelligence comes from. Building as many circuits as possible with myelin protecting them.I think the same thing happens with relationships. Business, personal, family relationships, etc. They start off young and that\\'s when you can build almost a \"relationship myelin\" around them. You do that by being honest with people, by showing gratitude, by not overusing the connection, by treating it just right so it develops into something that can last a lifetime.If someone does something for you, show you are grateful.J) BE THE SERVANT OF MANY.Tony said in the interview exactly how much he saved in taxes by moving from California to Florida. It was a big number. He had a big house. He\\'s spoken in front of three million people. He\\'s feeding 50 million people. This is a process that took him 30 years or more.He said the way he did it was by being the servant of many. By constantly adding value to others, you get value come back to you. It becomes the most natural thing.Tony Robbins has his critics I am sure. But I know he has helped me get through a hard time 13 years ago, maybe even saving my life. I know he has helped others. People always seem to be afraid to admit it. I know I almost feel ashamed to say I needed help.But it\\'s by helping others and accepting help that we grow as a society. Sometimes people think \"choosing myself\" is a selfish concept. But it\\'s the only way you build the strength to help others. It\\'s the only way you surrender to not some man-made force, but a force inside yourself that is perhaps the most powerful there is.Claudia and I left his house and drove around and around talking about what the interview meant to us. And I guess we still are.[Here is the link to the podcast: http://bit.ly/1t8RJ80]]',\n",
       "  79: '[I wanted to make money. When I moved to NYC to get a fulltime job I was rich. I was making $40,000 a year. This was a huge move up from my prior salary of $28,300 a year.I thought I should be able to hire a butler on that kind of money.I bought a suit. I started looking at nice apartments. I figure I could afford the massive budget of $800 a month, give or take a \"few hundred\".One time there was an apartment available uptown. I met the real estate guy. While we were checking out the apartment he accidentally dropped his suitcase and about a dozen porn magazines fell out. He apologized while he picked them up and stuffed them back into this suitcase.I couldn\\'t afford his fee of 5% of the year\\'s rent. I had no money other than what was coming up on my next paycheck.So I lived with my parents which meant I had to get on a bus at 6am and I didn\\'t get back from the city until about 10pm each day.Finally, I was hanging around Washington Sq Park doing nothing and I met Elias and he needed a roommate. It was just $300 a month. I got the futon and he got the couch. It was one room. The broken shower was constantly running and the kitchen was so bad I didn\\'t set foot in it once.We kept different hours so I was usually asleep when he got home. With a girl.He and the girl would go into the bathroom and start having sex with her perched on him while the wall pushed back and forth, as if it were ready to burst and they would fall right through. My bed was against the wall and I\\'d try to sleep but also I\\'d stay up and listen.Elias was a strong chessplayer and made his money gambling chess in the park. His brother Jorge maybe is the most talented chessplayer in history but never really pursued the game after he was a teenager.One time I was sick and in the middle of the night Elias woke me and told me we were getting kicked out of the apartment.Then I decided I needed to make even more money.Nobody had websites then. I thought this was a big problem that I wanted to solve. Everyone needed a website.My brother-in-law and I did a website for a diamond wholesaler on 47th street. \"If you tell anyone you are doing this website,\" he said, in his thick Russian-Jewish accent, \"I\\'m going to have to kill you.\" People say that as a joke but he was serious.And now he\\'s dead. He was looking for diamonds in an obscure part of Russia and his plane crashed.Nobody on the street (known as the Diamond District in NYC) was allowed to know that a wholesaler was selling direct through the Internet. We charged $35,000 for that.My take was $17,500 which I used to pay for a year\\'s rent at the Chelsea Hotel in NYC.It was all cash. I gave it to the owner of the Chelsea in a paper bag and he said, \"are you a drug dealer?\" I don\\'t think he was asking this to see if I should live in his building or not. I think he was just curious.Then we did HBO\\'s website for close to $100,000. I was working at HBO and outsourced the site to my brother in law. Then we did AmericanExpress.com and LoudRecords.com, BadBoy, NewLine, and Miramax.com and TimeWarner.com and websites for The Matrix, the Wu-Tang Clan, Con Edison, and many others. We were in business.I worked all day at HBO and then all night at Reset, the name of the company. We got an office, then we got a bigger office. We had big parties.Maybe five other companies knew how to do websites in NYC at the time and we were the smallest but I like to think we did the most creative sites.We did a site called \"Shoebox\". I asked one of my neighbors at the Chelsea, who was a professional submissive, if she would let us photograph and interview her and her girlfriend, a professional dominatrix who was around 7 feet tall and had some sort of extra chromosome that enlarged everything about her and made her constantly lactate.They came over to our office where we had a big photo studio and they had about 20 pairs of shoes and all of their lingerie. The highlight for me was holding a glass of water up to Maria\\'s lips when she was completely tied up and thirsty in between takes.The site was so popular that Con Edison came over and said, \"that\\'s what we want our website to look like.\"Nobody knew what they were doing.It\\'s hard to be a first-time entrepreneur. I should\\'ve made our services into a product, for instance, raised money, and aimed for a big IPO.Instead we sold for a multiple of our profits. Maybe the only Internet company back then that was profitable. Stupid.I knew technology but I knew zero about business. I wish I had just even one mentor then who could\\'ve told me about the business side of things.We also wanted to try out different ideas. While we were running a website business we also tried to be a rap label, a producer of TV shows, and even a tea company.We found a rap group we liked and almost signed them but then lost interest.About half the companies we worked with had employees who asked for bribes in order to throw business our way. \"Bribe\" is a strong word. Sometimes it was more subtle. \"Favor\". Nevertheless, we always paid the bribe.Humiliation was common for me. I\\'d fly out to California to pitch Jim Carrey\\'s agent about doing his website. \"This is going to be HUGE!\" his agent said. \"you HAVE to go to a party with us later tonight.\" And an hour later I would call for directions to the party and the agent would say, \"Wait, wait, wait a sec. Who is this?\"Another time I hired someone to be CEO while I was still working full-time. He\\'s a good guy but I didn\\'t understand how to make a deal. He wanted 10% of the company that would vest in six months. In six months and one day he took his 10% and quit and made a sitcom for MTV.Water under the bridge. We\\'re good friends today.We felt like we were the wild west. Rappers with guns would stroll into our offices. Trent Reznor would hang out throwing around ideas for the Nine Inch Nails website.Miramax executives would scream at me over the phone if one pixel was out of place on their logo. One day we spent the day tasting different teas. We wanted to pitch Honest Tea but it didn\\'t work out.Clients would get shot and killed at awards ceremonies in the music industry. HBO one time wanted to buy us but that\\'s when I had to admit that I was at both places and had to quit working at HBO.My first day on the job I cried because I had no idea what to do or who to do it to and people stopped returning my calls after I left HBO.Then we started getting calls to get acquired. One guy said, \"I don\\'t know a hamburger from a website but I know that a stock with an Internet company is going to go up.\" He was from a company that manufactured burn gels and they wanted to buy us so they could put \".com\" at the end of their name.I went on a vacation to Paris. There\\'s a restaurant at the bottom of the Eiffel Tower. The guy sitting next to us was celebrating. He had just sold a chain of Papa John\\'s pizza stores. When I got back to New York he kept calling me and wanted to invest. Maybe he would\\'ve been my smart investor but we never took in any money.Eventually we sold. Eventually people realized that it doesn\\'t cost $75,000 to make a three page website about Dennis Miller. Eventually the entire web design business went bankrupt as an industry before it reinvented itself as \"full services\" in the Internet space.I didn\\'t know what to do after we sold the company. I felt totally lost.I had money and it seemed lonely sitting in a bank account. So I bought a house. I rode helicopters every week to Atlantic City. I made a lot of new friends who all wanted something and none of them speak to me anymore.I played poker every night for 365 straight days. \"Ingrid says hi\", Brian Koppelman, the writer of Rounders, wrote me the other day. Ingrid was usually in charge of the Mayfair Club, the best poker club in NY in 1999. Portrayed by Famke Jannsen in the movie.Every day was a mask to fool someone into having a relationship with me. Into doing business with me. Into not firing me. Into buying my company.When I actually had to \"be myself\" I went broke and lost all of my relationships almost instantly.I no longer even speak to my partners in the business, all of whom are blood relatives. I was drinking, gambling, running businesses into the ground, spending, and betraying.I could say, \"I wish someone had given me advice\" during this time but perhaps many people tried to.I wish I could say, \"I listened\" but I honestly didn\\'t have the ability to listen. I didn\\'t even know what listening meant.Listening is a more difficult skill than \"Doing\". Because you know the difference between \"done\" and \"not done\". But there\\'s no line that tells you whether you listened or not.This is the entire reason why the self-help business is a scam.There\\'s absolutely nothing that could\\'ve helped me. I would later lie down in the street and pray for a car to run over me while my baby girls were upstairs playing.I wish I could re-live the entire experience. Like the blizzard of 1996 when we all went to work at midnight to finish a website and it felt so good to deliver. Or when I was scared I\\'d have to fire everyone because I lost a big client and didn\\'t tell anyone. Now when people ask me what I would do differently I always say the same answer, \"I wouldn\\'t change a thing\".(Photo by Chris Potter)]',\n",
       "  80: '[I lost $15mm cash in one summer. It was about a million a week and then it picked up speed. Ugh, I\\'m like reading the newspaper twice. I know I\\'ve written about this before.But bear with me.I bought a house. I invested in bad companies. I started worse companies. I bought art. I took A LOT of helicopters.I thought about money all the time. I wanted to make $100 million. Then...I thought...I can finally feel like I achieved something.That\\'s how stupid I was. I then lost my house, lost my marriage, lost my friends, lost my family, lost a lot of opportunities.It was only when I found things more valuable than money that I was able to easily make money. Money is a byproduct of the following:Ten things more valuable than money.A) One 5 minute call with my daughter instead of doing a 5 minute call about business with someone I don\\'t like.PLEASE GOD, give me the strength to not take the five minute call with the person I don\\'t like.I can lose all the money in the world but I can make it back. I will NEVER get back the 5 minutes I could\\'ve spent with my daughters.Children want someone to tell their stories to. I make her laugh. 5 minutes of making her laugh she will remember forever.She will say at my deathbed, \"He always made me laugh\", but only if I devote those 5 minutes to her. That\\'s more valuable than money.B) Writing down ideasI like to write down ten ideas a day. That\\'s 3,650 ideas a year. I do it on a waiter\\'s pad. I have over 100 waiter\\'s pads in my closet.Ideas are more valuable than money. Income has gone down versus inflation for 40 years.And people say ideas are a \"dime a dozen\". I can tell you this is not true. Pick any concept. Like say, \"10 ideas of novels I can write\". Maybe the first 3 might be easy (\"a dime for three ideas\"). But ten starts to get difficult.Then people say \"execution is everything\". This is so wrong.First, you can\\'t execute without a decent idea to begin with.Second, execution ideas are a subset of ideas.Let\\'s say I have a good idea for a novel. Now my next execution step is to have ideas for all the chapters. An outline. Then my next execution step is to have ideas for when I will write. And so on.Money lasts for a few seconds in my hands. But ideas can grow and build and spread and touch everyone I know and then everyone they know.C) Ideas for Other peopleI had $0 in the bank in 2008 when I was getting my divorce. I had almost zero friends because I was so ashamed of my circumstances I was afraid to tell anyone. \"You mean it happened to you AGAIN!?\" they would say.Then I started to make money.How did I start making money? I started sending \"10 Ideas to Make X Better\". Where X might be a person or a business. Then I would send to X.One out of 50 would respond. But that\\'s ok. That\\'s all it takes to make millions.D) Persistence is more valuable than moneyIn the above case I had to (and still do) send out 100s of emails. I had to do hours of research to come up with ideas. I had to go to meetings without any clue what the outcome would be.But persistence let me touch people. Persistence let me share my ideas. Persistence got people excited about those ideas. Persistence got me paid for those ideas.E) Physical HealthI can get in the car, drive two miles to the gym, and then walk on the treadmill for two miles while watching about Ebola on CNN in front of me.Or I can sleep well, eat well, and take a few healthy walks during the week.Sometimes Claudia, my wife, makes me do yoga with her. Ok, I can do that also. Sometimes I think I\\'m very good at it when I finally touch my toes.I don\\'t care how long I live. If I die tomorrow I feel like I\\'ve lived a life worth living. But I do want quality of life until I die. My father spent the last two years of his life staring at a ceiling because he was paralyzed from a stroke.I keep healthy because if you spend two years of your life staring at a ceiling, money is worth zero.F) LaughingGuess what? Kids laugh on average 300 times a day. Adults laugh on average....5 times a day.What the hell happened?I can\\'t pay people to laugh. Money doesn\\'t make me laugh. Except when I\\'m bathing in it and pretending to be Dr. Evil.Laughter is linked to all sorts of things that make you healthier. Like it releases oxytocin throughout the body which gives feelings of happiness and calmness. I have to give a TEDx talk later. I need to laugh before then. Here\\'s my go-to laugh items of the day: \\nthe book \"Food\" by Jim Gaffigan\\nAndy Samberg\\'s Harvard commencement speech\\nAny standup by Louis CK\\nthe book \"Ant Farm\" by Simon Rich\\nthe TV show \"Family Guy\"\\nI\\'m sure I will find others. I will get up to those 300 laughs today and it will have nothing to do with money but it will have everything to do with my future happiness and success.The best way to be successful in the next minute is to be successful this second.G) GivingThis sounds like a cliche. People always say \"give and you shall receive\", which I believe in but since people always say it, it\\'s a cliche.When I was dead broke (again, or prior) in 2001 I would volunteer in a charity.So instead of feeling bad for myself or getting anxious about killing myself because I had no money, I felt good about the charity work and I also got a crush on the woman doing the work with me.Nothing happened in the crush but sometimes the hint that love is all around is enough to stop the anxiety and cure the worries about money.Giving is a soft boomerang. You throw it as hard as you can. It touches everyone around. And then it flies back into your hand. And you know what? When you catch it, that feels like fun. Fun is a game. Fun is better than money.H) Your DNAThe universe has been around for 13.2 billion years (acccording to a professor I spoke to yesterday. Maybe he\\'s right or maybe it was created one second ago by aliens who are doing a scientific experiment and we can\\'t even tell).The universe will be around for another ten trillion at least. You will be around for another 40-60 years, give or take 100.Your body will be dead. So will your mind. Hardware fails, but your software (your DNA) will live on.The best thing you can do for your DNA is to leave a legacy. We know that money doesn\\'t work as a legacy. It disappears after a few generations. But other legacies can live for thousands of years. Your ancestors, your ideas, the light you have shared with others.I) ExperiencesOne Christmas I bought my kids big beautiful presents. Now we all try to remember what they were but we forget.Other Christmases I find a great location, rent a beautiful place, get a ping pong table shipped in, and my kids and I fly out there and have fun for ten days. Then Claudia makes a poster about the experience.For years we talk about the different experiences. My kids will never forget it. I converted my money into an experience rather than just another material good.I\\'m preparing them for all the great things they will have to talk about on my death bed.J) Me.I am more valuable than money. I\\'m such an amazing thing. With DNA, and neurochemicals, and I try to make people laugh. And I try to help people. And I\\'m amazingly humble. NOBODY, and I mean NOBODY, is more humble than me.Nobody is more deserving of love than me.Except you.(Photo by Tohan B.)]',\n",
       "  81: '[When I met with Bernie Madoff to see if he would put money into my hedge fund I had no idea he had a scheme.Everyone said later, \"We always knew\". But on the way to the meeting, those same people were calling me and saying, \"ask him if we could invest.\"They would deny it now of course. Not because they lie or they are bad (who can judge another?) but maybe they now keep secrets from themselves or maybe they are afraid. We are all afraid sometimes.Like when we meet the girl and tell of our accomplishments but leave out the time our hand went through a window in an argument with a very similar girl.When I left Madoff\\'s office I was depressed. \"How can I ever raise money with men like Madoff around?\"I didn\\'t have a theme then. I had my own scheme. To raise money. So I could feed my family. So I could live. So I could have significance among my friends. So they could beg to invest with me. So maybe other women would love me. So maybe I could live in a bigger place. Or have bigger friends.I didn\\'t know what a theme was. I just felt fear all the time.Where is the food? Where is the affection? Every barter had fear hidden inside of it.Think of it. Yesterday, you were a spy. What secrets of the universe did you withhold from the people around you?You graduate from schemes to themes when you have a vision that helps people.\"I have a new method that will help people make money.\"\"I have a new way to help my colleagues\".\"I have a new way for people to share information with friends.\"\"I have a way to feed millions of people and build schools for them.\"\"I have a new method for helping people be healthy or loved.\"\"I have a new way to make people laugh.\"\"I have new ways to help people realize their own visions. To lead their own businesses. To turn ideas into money into charity.\"\"I have a new way for two, three, ten people to connect and share and help each other.\"We were each handed out two eyes and then shot like a bullet into the world. Our only job: to report back what we see. Each eye is unique. Each vision is unique.A vision is giving because we only create value for ourselves when we create more value for others. Else it\\'s a scheme.A vision is large. Else it falls back into the market, everyone selling the same commodities back and forth to each other just so they can live one more day.A vision excites others. Because they have their own visions and you can trigger a spark that lets them set their vision on fire with yours.A vision doesn\\'t worry about money or love. Those are byproducts of vision. When you can feed the herd, trust that the herd will feed you back.I\\'ve had themes and I\\'ve had schemes. When you work with a scheme you are constantly worried they will figure you out.When I\\'ve worked on things I really believe in, visions that have the attributes above, there is no sense of worry, no sense that I have to get on and get out as quickly as possible.When I was working on my first successful business I felt like everyone needed to have their own websites. I wanted everyone in the world to have one. I would do websites for free for billion dollar companies because I wanted them to have one. That gave me up to 1000 employees until the theme turned into a scheme like many themes do.Themes need to change because what we see in the world around us changes. Every day we wake up and the sun is rising and there are either clouds or no clouds, good weather or bad. You have to dress for the weather based on what you see.A theme adds value to others. A scheme only adds value to ourselves. Schemes ultimately fail.Is this a rant or a story? I don\\'t know.One time I was on a date. The girl got a call in the middle of the date. She took the call right in front of me, in the middle of dinner.\"I\\'m on a date with that guy I told you about,\" she said. Then she listened. Then she said, \"I don\\'t know. At first I thought he was ugly but now I don\\'t think so anymore.\"Then I moved to sit down side by side with her.That\\'s a story. And it didn\\'t end well.I believe everyone has a vision. The sky is always blue, even if the clouds seem perpetually in front of it, blocking you from that blue.Trust that when you you live by a theme, you choose yourself, you get super powers, and then you help others choose themselves.Then you can finally see the vast blue, stretched out into infinity that you can paint on. Turn your scheme into a theme.At first you were ugly. Then I thought you were beautiful.(Photo by Thierry Ehrmann)]',\n",
       "  82: '[In the history of capitalism, this is the hardest time ever to invest. People are going broke, losing their jobs, and fear more than greed rules the news and tries to rule thoughts.In short: people are scared. And I do think the uncertainty is going to rise quickly so I wanted to put this note together.In 2001 and 2002 I lost all my money through bad investing. The same thing happened to me on a couple of occasions after that.So why should anyone listen to me about investing? You shouldnt. You shouldnt listen to anyone at all about investing. This is your hard-earned money. Dont blow it by listening to an idiot like me.The most important three words in investing is: I dont know. If someone doesnt say that to you then they are lying.I was preparing this morning for my podcast conversation I am having tomorrow with Stephen Dubner, co-author of Freakonomics and the upcoming Think Like a Freak. One of the statistics he points out is that CXO Advisory Group polled the predictions of 500 investment strategists and pundits. The experts had a 47% success rate. Good luck if you listen to any of them.Heres my experience (and perhaps Ive learned the hard way about what NOT to do and a little bit about what TO do.):Ive run a hedge fund that was successful. I ran a fund of hedge funds, which means Ive probably analyzed the track records and strategies of about 1000 different hedge funds.Ive learned ONE MAJOR THING, which I will repeat below: ALL OF WALL STREET IS A SCAM. There are zero exceptions.Ive been a venture capitalist and a successful angel investor (I was a HORRIBLE venture capitalist though  but I put that under the category of does not work well with others).I cant raise money anymore. Nor do I want to play that game. I dont BS about my losses and everyone else does.So Im not in that business anymore. Its too much work to run a fund anyway.In the past 15 years Ive tried every investing strategy out there. I honestly cant think of a strategy I havent experimented with.Ive also wrote software to trade the markets automatically and I did very well with that but that industry is now dominated by the high frequency guys.And Ive written several books on my experiences investing, with topics ranging from automatic investing to Warren Buffett, to hedge funds, to long-term investing (my worse-selling book, The Forever Portfolio, which has sold 399 copies since it came out in December 2008, including one copy for the entire last quarter).Incidentally, why publish a book called The Forever Portfolio during the worst financial crisis in history. I begged my publisher (Penguin) to postpone but they couldnt. Its in the schedule was their magic incantation. Publishers largely suck. The good news is: they will never make back the advance.That said, all of the picks in that book have done excellently since then (Claudia proved this in a review of the book on Amazon but then was shamed into admitting she was my wife, which she did not at first disclose) but the one thing I am proud of is that I made a crossword puzzle for the book. I dont know of any other investing book with a crossword puzzle in it.So, Ok! Lets get started. Dont follow any of my advice. This is advice that I do and follow and it works for me.A) Should I Daytrade?Only if you are also willing to take all of your money, rip it into tiny pieces, make cupcakes with one piece of money inside each cupcake and then eat all of the cupcakes.Then you will get sick, and eat all of your money, but it will taste thrilling along the way. Which is what daytrading is.B) I Don\\'t Believe You. Many People Daytrade For A Living.No. I personally know of two. Maybe three. And they work 24 hours a day at it and have been doing it for a decade or more. So unless you want to put in that amount of time and be willing to lose a lot first then you shouldnt do it.One more thing: when you daytrade and lose money its not like a job.When you go into a job you NEVER lose money. If you show up for two weeks, you get paid. Even if you have been warned repeatedly about sexual harassment you still get paid. You might get fired but they wont take your money.The stock market TAKES your money on bad days.Sometimes it takes a lot of your money. Were not used to the brutality of that and it can destroy a person psychologically, which makes one (me) trade even worse.C) Well, Who Makes Money In The Market Then?Three types of people:\\nPeople who hold stocks FOREVER. Think: Warren Buffett (has never sold a share of Berkshire Hathaway since 1967) or Bill Gates (he sells shares but for 20 years basically held onto his MSFT stock).\\nPeople who hold stocks for a millionth of a second (see Michael Lewiss book Flash Boys which I highly recommend.) This is borderline illegal and I dont recommend it.\\nPeople who cheat.\\nIve seen it for 20 years. Ive seen every scam. I can write a history of scams in the past 20 years.Without describing them, heres the history: Reg S, Calendar trading, Mutual fund timing, Death spirals, Front running, Pump and Dump, manipulating illiquid stocks, Ponzi schemes, and inside information. Inside information has always existed and always will exist. Those are scams from just the past 15 years. If I went back 50 years the list would be fifty times as big.ONE TIME I WANTED TO RAISE MONEY for one of my funds. I went to visit my neighbors boss. The boss had been returning a solid 12% per year for 20 years.EVERYONE wanted to know how he did it. Get some info while you are there, a friend of mine in the business said when he heard I was visiting my neighbors boss.The boss said to me, Im sorry, James. We like you and if you want to work here, then that would be great. But we have no idea what you would be doing with the money. And here at Bernard Madoff Securities, reputation is everything.So I didnt raise money from Bernie Madoff although he wanted me to work there. Seemed like a very nice guy.I was depressed when I left his offices in the so-called lipstick building. Why will I never be good enough? I thought.Later, the same friend who wanted me to get info and figure out how he does it said to me: we knew all along he was a crook.Which is another thing common in Wall Street. Everybody knows everything in retrospect and nobody ever admits they were wrong.Show me a Wall Street pundit who says I was wrong and Ill show youI dont knowsomething graphic and horrible and impossible [fill in blank].Remember the magic words.I. Dont. Know.D) So how can one make money in the market?I told you about: #1. Pick some stocks and hold them forever. Since I dont know applies, its almost impossible to pick the right ones.E) What stocks should I hold?Warren Buffett has some advice on this (and I know because I wrote THE book about him. A friend of mine who knows him told me my book was the only book that Buffett thought was accurate about him).So since I dont know anything, I will let Warren Buffett take over here.He says, if you think a company will be around 20 years from now then it is probably a good buy right now.I would add to that, based on what Warren does. It seems to me he has five criteria:\\nA company will be around 20 years from now.\\nAt some point, companys management has demonstrated in some way that they are honest, good people. If you can get to know management even better.\\nThe companys stock has crashed for some reason (think American Express in early 60s, which he loaded up on. Or Washington Post in the early 70s. Or Coca-Cola in the early 80s).\\nThe companys name is a strong brand: American Express, Coke, Disney, etc.\\nDemographics play a strong role.\\nWith Coke, Buffett knew that everyone in the world would be drinking sugared water before long. Who can resist? He also started buying furniture companies right before the housing boom. He knew that as the population in the US grows, people will need chairs to sit on.Note that Buffett is not what some people call a Value investor. But I wont get into that discussion here.F) What Else?One time I accidentally got an email that was intended for a famous well-known investor. It was from his broker and contained his portfolio. I cant say how this accident happened but it did.Of course, I opened the email.This is a man who writes about lots of stocks.His entire portfolio was in municipal bonds.I dont know whether or not municipal bonds are good investments. But I would look into stocks that are called closed-end funds that invest only in municipal bonds.They usually pay good dividends, usually trade for less than their cash or assets in the bank, and are fairly stable (its very hard for a municipality to not pay back its debts for various reasons, some of them constitutional).But do a lot of research into the towns.Ill tell you one story. I had an idea for a fund in 2008 when oil was crashing at the end of the year.Stocks / funds that invested in municipal bonds in Texas were getting destroyed. Somehow, because oil was going down, everyone naturally assumed that Texas was going to simply disappear. I assumed that most people were wrong about Texas.I researched every municipal bond out there and found a good set of Texan cities that were being sold off with everyone else even though they had nothing to do with oil.I pitched it to a huge investor who had told me he wanted to back me on any idea I could come up with.He loved the idea. He loved it so much he didnt invest with me and a few weeks later he told me, We now have about $500 million in this strategy and we bought the very stocks you are recommending.I dont know what to think about this. Thats Wall Street.They went up over 100% in the next six months while the world was still in financial collapse. So he made a lot of money.As for me, I didnt put a dime into my own strategy and made nothing.But thats my fault.In investing, you never have anyone to blame but yourself. Blaming is draining.G) Should I Put All Of My Money In Stocks?No, because youll never know anything about a company and you wont get the kind of deals that Warren Buffett gets.So use this guideline:\\nNo more than 3% of your portfolio in any one stock. But if the stock grows past 3% you can keep it. To quote Warren Buffett again: If you have Lebron James on your team, you dont trade him away.\\nNo more than 30% of your portfolio in stocks (unless some of the stocks grow, in which case you just keep letting them grow).\\nG, PART 2) What If We Are In A Bubble?Some hedge fund manager (David Einhorn) just said we might be in a tech bubble. Back to rule #1: He doesnt know. Its just a headline.Bubbles dont mean anything. We had an internet bubble in the 90s. Then a housing bubble. Bubbles bubbles bubbles. And if you just held through all of that, your stock portfolio right now would be about a percent from all-time highs.So ignore cycles and bubbles and ups and downs.AND NEVER EVER read the news. The news has no idea about the financial world and what makes it tick. Any investing off the news is like taking out your eyes because you trust a blind person to drive you to work.H) My Friend Has A Business Idea. Should I Invest In It?Probably not. But if you want a checklist, make sure these four boxes can be checked:\\nThe CEO has started and sold a business before.\\nThe business is a sector with a strong demographic headwind behind it. (or is that a tailwind?)\\nThe company has revenues and/or profits.\\nYou are getting a really good deal. (This is subjective but you can look at similar companies and what they were valued at.)\\nI can say this: every time I have invested with this approach its worked miracles. And every time I have not invested in this approach its been a DISASTER. Like, a CLUSTERF*(*KClaudia doesnt let me invest in a private company unless all four items on my checklist apply. Its good to be able to say, I love your idea but my wife wont let me invest.After that, they usually say something like (.. you can imagine) but I dont care. I get to keep the money in my wallet and not give it to them.Which is important because I tend to believe in everything people tell me.I) What Do You Think of Bitcoin?I think bitcoin has about a 1 in 100 chance of being a survivor. So I have 1% of my portfolio in bitcoin. I can write a lot more on bitcoin. I sold Choose Yourself in bitcoins before the book was officially released. Bitcoin went up 500% after that.I can explain everything about bitcoin but I cant explain the future. So well see.J) What About Metals as a Hedge Against Inflation?No, they have zero correlation with inflation. The best hedge against inflation is the US stock market since about 60% of revenues of the S&amp;P 500 comes from foreign countries.K) What About Metals Like Gold? Don\\'t They Have Intrinsic Value?The only currency in the history of mankind that had actual intrinsic value was when people traded barley in the markets of the ancient city of Ur. Since then, weve developed currencies that depended on our faith in their value.Every currency has faith and hope backing it. When people began to lose faith in US currency (in the Civil War), the words In God We Trust were put on the dollar bill to trick people into having faith in it.But if youre going to pick a metal, wait until the gold/silver ratio gets higher than its historical average and buy silver.How come? Because silver is both a precious metal (like gold) and an industrial metal (also like gold, but much much cheaper). So there actually is some intrinsic value in silver.I bought some silver bars back in 2005. But then lost them when I moved. Thats why nobody should listen to me about investing.L) What About Mutual Funds?No. Mutual funds, and the bank representatives that push them, consistently lie about the fees they are charging. I know this from experience.One time I accompanied a friend of mine who had made some money (she was a model and had a good run for awhile) and was looking to invest it. She asked me to go with her to see her bank representative who had some ideas. Because she was beautiful, I went with her to the bank.I didnt talk at all during the meeting but jotted down every time the bank guy lied. He lied five times.Afterwards I explained each of the lies to her.What happened? She put all her money with the guy. Hes practically family. I cant argue with a good salesman.But he lied about the mutual funds performance that he was pitching, the fees they were charging, the commissions he was charging, and a few more I cant remember now. I wrote an article about it in the Financial Times back then.Fact: Mutual funds dont outperform the general market so better to invest in the general market without paying the extra layer of fees.Use the criteria I describe above, pick 20 companies and invest.M) What Are Some Good Demographic Trends?\\nThe internet. Yes, its still growing.\\nBaby boomers retiring. They need special facilities to live in. They need better cancer diagnostics and treatments.\\nEnergy. The more people we have, the more energy we will consume. Go for energy sources that are profitable and dont need government subsidies. Whenever you depend on the government, you could get in trouble.\\nTemp staffing. Every company is firing people and replacing them with temp staffers.\\nBatteries. If you can figure out how to invest in Lithium, then go for it.\\nand a dozen others. Feel free to list more in the comments. I plan on covering more in my email newsletter.\\nN) Is A House A Good Investment?Everyone will disagree with me on this but the answer is an emphatic NO!It has all the qualities of a horrible investment:\\nConstant extra layers of fees and taxes that never go away (maintenance, property taxes, etc that all rise with inflation).\\nUsually housing is too-large a percentage of someones portfolio. Even just the down-payment ends up being the largest expense of someones life.\\nUsually massive debt is involved.\\nIf you can avoid, 1, 2, and 3 and dont mind the opportunity cost in the time required to maintain your house then go for it. Else, rent, and use the money you saved for other investments that will be less stressful and pay off more.Fact: Housing has returned 0.2% per year in the past 100 years.O) If No Housing and Only 30% Of My Portfolio in Stocks, Then What Should I Do With The Rest of My Money?Why are you in such a rush to put all of your money to work? Relax! Dont do it!Theres a saying cash is king for a reason. I will even say cash is queen because on the chessboard the king is just a figurehead and the queen is the most valuable piece.Cash is a beautiful thing to have. You can pay for all of your basic needs with it.You can sleep at night knowing there is cash in the bank.I love a stress-free life. When I look back at the past 15 years, the times when Ive been most stressed is when Ive been heavily invested and the times when Ive been least stressed is when I had cash in the bank.With cash in the bank you can also invest in yourself.P) What Does That Mean, \"Invest In Myself?\"\\nIt costs almost nothing to start a business. Find something people want and start posting information about it on a blog and then upsell your services on the blog.Or write 1000 small books about different topics and publish them on Amazon. You can do this on the side while you learn and have a full time job and then when you are ready, you can jump to your other passive streams of income. I have a podcast coming up soon with a guy who makes $25,000 a month doing this. Note: It takes a lot of work to find passive income but when it happens, its worth it.These are some ideas. There are many others.\\nInvest in experiences rather than possessions.Figure out interesting and unique experiences you can have or places you can go to (but they dont always have to be places). Experiences pay much higher dividends than an extra TV or a nicer car.\\nBooks. Reading is the best return on investment. You have to live your entire life in order to know one life.But with reading you can know 1000s of peoples lives for almost no cost. What a great return!\\nQ) Should I Save Money With Each Paycheck?No. Just try to make more money. That is easier than saving money. I find that whenever I try to save money I end up spending more. I dont know why that is. Im a horrible spender, which is probably why Ive gone broke so many times.Better to just make more with many streams of income so you dont have to worry about going broke. And then saving will come naturally as you make more money.Dont forget that a salary will never make you money. After taxes and the daily grind, and your exhaustion and the feelings of I hate my job, and then inflation and then new expenses (kids), you will never be able to save. Avoiding Starbucks every day wont make you a millionaire, thats a fact.I say it glibly, try to make more money. I know its not that easy. But in the long run, if you have a constant focus on alternative ways to make more money, then you will.R) What Else Should I Do With My Money?Forget about it.Money is just a side effect of health.I talk a lot about the daily practice I started doing when I was at my lowest point.I know now after years of doing it that it has worked. Ive done very well with it, and I started doing it when I was dead broke, lonely, angry, depressed, and suicidal.I didnt start it from a position of privilege.And you dont have to buy my book. Im not selling anything.Heres the whole thing: stay physically healthy in whatever way you know how (sleep well, eat well, exercise). Be around good people who love you and respect you and who you love and respect, and be grateful every day.Think of new things each day (or all day) to be grateful for. Gratitude is another word for Abundance because the things you are most grateful for, become abundant in your life.And finally, write down 10-20 bad ideas a day. Or good ideas. It doesnt matter. After exercising my idea muscle for six months, I felt like an idea machine. It was like a super power that just wouldnt stop. More on this in another post.Money and abundance in your life is a natural side effect of the above. I know this for myself but now since writing about it for almost four years I can tell you from the letters I get that it works for others.S) What\\'s In It For You?I dont know. I used to write about money stuff because I wanted investors, or I wanted to sell books, or get speaking engagements. Now I want none of that.I HATE WRITING ABOUT FINANCE NOW. Because its almost all bullshit and I dont want to be like the other BS.But I get worried that in a world of increasing economic uncertainty that more and more people are getting stuck and getting lied to and are scared about what is happening.Most people will think I am giving bad advice. Thats fine. I probably am. I just am trying to avoid the BS and I hope do also.Too many people I know are nervous and depressed.Theres nothing else to know about investing your money. If your bank tries to give you any advice just say, thanks but Im ok.If they want you to put your money in a savings account, even so you can get the interest I would politely decline. Theres a reason they are asking you to do this and I have no idea what it is but its not good for you.You wont get rich investing your money but you can do very well. And if you combine that with investing in yourself, you will get wealthy.But only if you remember that financial wealth is a side effect of real inner wealth.This is the most powerful investment you can do with your time and your life.You can always make money back when youve lost it.But one single split moment of stress and anxiety you will NEVER make back again.Investing in the future will never bring back the past.To be able to sit and not have a million stressful thoughts racing through your head. To be able to appreciate everything around you for the abundance it is.Most people think they need to say thank you to the world.But the world is constantly saying thank you to you for being alive, for creating new things, new energies, new experiences.Every day give the world at least one more reason to whisper thank you to you.If you can hear that whisper, everything else, every gift in life, becomes expected. You earned it.Just take it.(Photo by Shai Barzilay)]',\n",
       "  83: '[I swept the chess pieces to the floor and ran out. The pieces were still popping around on the ground like popcorn when I left the room where the match was being played. It was my school versus some other school. I had lost.I didnt care at all about the rest of my team. Losers.The coach of the team, an English teacher, ran out after me but he was sort of laughing. Stop, he said. Wait.But I didnt want to. I had lost. I was worthless. I hated myself. I hated everyone. The rest of my team was laughing. I could hear them. Laughing at me. The other team was in shock.I am a sore loser. Its not that Im so competitive with others. But Im competitive with myself. I like to do better than I did before. Sometimes that means something very bad: I like to be perfect at the things Im interested in.Of course, its impossible to be perfect.I had nightmares that night. My dad opened my door at 3 in the morning and asked if I were ok. No, and there was nothing he could do.I didnt go to school the next day or the next. I was a loser with acne and now a bad chess player.A year later I was the highest ranking under 20 year old in my state. And then I basically stopped playing except when my life was in big transition in the 90s and then I played quite a bit.But I played other games, during other transitions. I always played games to escape the bad things that were happening in my life.The best games are a metaphor for life. So I would always escape my life (a bad relationship, a bad trade, a bad business, feelings of being useless, etc) by playing games.I played a lot of the game Go, when I was burntout and about to get kicked out of graduate school.I played a lot of poker (365 nights straight, including the night my daughter was born) when I was, well, becoming a father! I played a lot of Scrabble when I went broke. And then Hearts. And then backgammon.There is a particular grammar to mastering a game and its not different from the grammar of mastering anything. Once you learn how to speak one new language, its easy to learn how to speak a third language and even easier to learn how to speak a fourth language.Ive seen this across every game player I know. Someone who is good at chess can easily master poker. Or, and Ive told this story before, theres Falafel.Around 1994 I started playing Falafel in Washington Sq Park. He was homeless and often had grass in his dirty hair from wherever it was he had been sleeping the night before.Wed play for 50 cents a game, sometimes a dollar depending on what he could afford to risk losing. He wasnt as good as me so Id give some odds. His name was Falafel because that is all he would eat.Then he disappeared. It was six months before I saw him at the park again. He was smiling.In just a few months time he had become one of the best backgammon players in the world. He had started playing Wall Street bankers in a price club on the Upper West Side. He build up to a bankroll of $800,000. Then he lost it all. Then he made it all back. A game player cant be stopped.20 years later, I think he is now ranked #1 in the world at backgammon when comparing his moves with the moves a computer would make.Then there was Ylon. He was a chess master (the first time we ever played, I beat him, but then he solidly has turned the table on me) who switched from chess to backgammon to poker. Now, $6mm in poker winnings later, he runs a bar in Brooklyn.Mastering a game requires you to do the exact opposite of what everyone else does. Since 99.99% of people wont master a game you need to do the reverse to conquer them.I dont know, maybe that above paragraph is the only rule you need to know. But I love games so much I have ten or eleven other rules.Heres what Ive learned from mastering the various games Ive played:A) LOOK AT ALL OF THE CANDIDATE MOVESThis applies to everything: games, business, relationships, everything in life.I see it happen in reverse too many times. People think of a what if and then go way deep down analyzing that what if as if there was a 100% chance it would happen rather than an almost 1% chance it would happen.Like what if my wife is cheating. or what if my idea is bad or what if this marketing plan doesnt work out.In the 1950s classic chess book, Think Like a Grandmaster Alexander Kotovs first technique is to: List all the candidate moves first.In other words, list all the options that can happen. Dont go deeply down ANY OF THEM. Then start to look slightly deeper down each one and see which options you can quickly eliminate.This saves you mental energy and time. This one technique raises your IQ.It turns out, some 30 years later, this is how chess computers are programmed. The best chess computers are now solidly better than humans. The first thing a chess program does when looking at position: it lists the candidate moves.B) DONT TAKE TOO MANY RISKSGames are all about taking risks.But if you take too many risks, you always lose. In Backgammon, if you leave too many blots open, you will get hit, sent back to the bar, and eventually get blocked off the board and lose. If you play too conservatively, youll also lose.Trial and error tells you how many risks to take, but err on the side of not taking risks.This is true for business also. People say to me, I have a great idea! Should I quit my job and just go for it?Answer: NO.Do both at the same time. I was at my fulltime job for 18 months while pursuing my side business. By the time I left my full time job to be a full time CEO of my side business I had 11 employees.I took a lot of risks in those 18 months. But I didnt do anything that would risk losing the game.C) LOOK FOR THE SHORT CUTSEvery game, and almost every life situation, has short cuts: ways you can get better without learning the entire literature of the game from beginning to end.A great example is Scrabble. If you want to be the best Scrabble player in the world then it certainly helps to know all the legal words.But if you want to be a better Scrabble player than 95% of the other Scrabble players it helps to know just two things:\\nall the two letter words\\nall the Q words without U: qat qopf qi qanat etc\\nand if you want to go one step further and be the coolest guy at the table, learn the six letters S A T I N EAlmost every letter you can add to those six will make a legal seven letter world. Example E. Etesian. X Antisex.If you are home for Thanksgiving and someone breaks out the board (and has the latest official Scrabble dictionary so ZA and QI are legal) then youll almost certainly win if you just know those two things.What if your cousins want to play Monopoly instead? Ok, do everything you would normally do but with one difference. Buy, borrow,beg, steal, to get the Orange properties.Trust me.D) PLAY PEOPLE BETTER THAN YOUYoure the average of the five people you spend your time with.When I was playing a lot, many of my friends didnt want to play me. They didnt want to lose.I specifically wanted to play people I would lose to. Over and over again. You learn more from losing than winning. Losing is not failure. Losing gives you a treasure trove of insights into how you, personally, can get better.When I was first starting out, I would always find people better than me. When I first moved to NY I even moved in with a player much stronger than me at chess.Wed play all night. I got better until finally I was at least as good as him if not better (we played a match once and when he was two games down he quit the match).If youre starting out in business, work first for a good company that has a high profit margin. This is a business run by good businessmen. Learn from them.If you cant directly learn from them, read from them. Study what they do. Break it down. Dont wast time with the people who will bring you down.E) LUCK FAVORS THE PREPAREDI was in a poker hand with Irv Gotti, the CEO of rap label Murder, Inc. He was laughing and everyone time Id raise he wouldnt even hesitate before raising me again.We were in his offices and there were two tables in a private game. The guy next to me had just produced the move 300. David Schwimmer was a regular in the game. Another guy had just sold his poker software company for $50 million. And Irv Gotti was the host. There was a lot of money around the table.I had a great hand, Irv kept raising me. And then on the final card dealt, he got the card he needed and won the hand, and I had no money left at the game so I left.He just got lucky, I thought. And that card was certainly lucky. But he had been in worse hands that night. He had people intimidated with his non-stop talk.He would aggressively raise so people would be afraid to play against him because he was too unpredictable. Just those things, let him build up a bankroll where he could take more risks even in situations where the odds were against him.I dont know how much money he made that night but I know what I left with: $0. I also found out that he took lessons from very good poker players and at that point, I hadnt played or studied in yeas.He was more prepared than me.Whenever you feel like saying, I was just unlucky trust me when I say, youre probably an idiot. Analyze the reality. Dont just try to make yourself feel better.Blaming is draining.In chess theres a saying, Only the good players get lucky. This applies to every area of life.As Scott Adams (creator of Dilbert) said to me, if you know youre only going to succeed at 10% of the things you try, make sure you try 100 things.F) STUDY THE HISTORYEvery game, every industry, has its history. A history of successful business models, of successful people, of styles in which the game was played. Of colorful personalities.If you dont love the history of what want to master, then you will never master it.Simon Rich, one of the funniest writers I have ever read, the youngest writer of SNL ever, and now working on two movies and a sitcom, said to me, if you dont wake up and want to write first thing, you probably shouldnt be writing.In the course of our discussion he mustve referred to 50 different books and comedians and movies, etc.Its like the movie Groundhog Day. Bill Murray relives every day over and over. He becomes a better person for it.You cant do that. You cant relive the same day. But you can relive the thousands of days before you in the area you are most interested in by studying the history of the field you love.Writers should of course constantly read. You cant write a good book if you havnt read 500 other good books. You cant write a good screenplay if you havnt watched 100s of movies and appreciate the beauty of specific shows from the 60s, the 70s and the various eras of movies that came after that.I dont think I know a single chess master who hasnt read through Bronsteins 1953 Zurich International tournament book at least a dozen times. Or Mikhail Tals Best games.Poker players have read Doyle Brunsons classic a dozen times. And entrepreneurs have all now read Walter Isaacsons book on Steve Jobs and dozens of other biographies of successful businessmen.The history of a game or life is your virtual mentor if you dont have a direct mentor.G) MASTER YOUR PSYCHOLOGYI was a very bad sore loser. If I even lost one game in a tournament I would drop out.As mentioned above, I lost one game and swept the pieces to the floor, creating a scene, and making someone else clean up after my mess. Not to mention making a fool of myself.Failure is the hip new word. People say, you have to fail to succeed. This is not true. Failure is the fastest way to becoming a failure.Instead, view everything as an experiment. Every experiment has problems. As Peter Thiel says, Get good at solving hard problems.When something doesnt work out, see how you can make it 5% better the next time. Theres always a next time.If there wasnt a next time. Warren Buffett wouldve quit investing in 1956. Or 1957. Or 1958. Instead, almost 60 years later, hes still learning from the things he tries (and hes made many multi-billion dollar mistakes even in the past decade) and then he tries to make the next situation 5% better so he doesnt make the same mistakes.If you love someone or something, you will have many many opportunities to kiss. If one kiss isnt perfect, then be 5% better in how you treat that person, in how you surprise, in how you learn, in how you study, and the next kiss will be love.Better to love than to be bitter, than to think youre unlucky, than to not be prepared, then to not delight the people around you.H) TEWARI ANALYSISThis is a trick in a game called, Go. Which happens to be the most popular board game in the world but many in the US dont know about it because its popular in Japan, Korea, and China.No computer can play Go. Its too difficult. Much more difficult than chess. And when I play through a game played by two professionals its almost like they are not playing a game but mutually creating a new work of art that takes my breath away.I used to take lessons from a guy who had been the Chinese Amateur Champion a year or so earlier.I would make a move and he would shake his head. He knew one English word. No.Then he would show me why. He would take off the last few moves made and then recreate the position but put the pieces down as if we had made the moves in a different order.Then a light would shine, Ahh! Because if I had made the move I was planning, in the exact same position but as if the moves leading up to that position were in a different order, then it suddenly was clear why my move was bad.Example: someone wrote to me the other day that they had made $50 million dollars when they were very young. Then very quickly, the person had lost $30 million and was feeling horrible.Tewari analysis would say: Well, what if you had simply gone from $0 to $20 million, rather than from $0 to $50 million and then down to $20 million?You would be in the exact same situation, but you probably wouldnt feel horrible.Our minds give great weight to the perception of motion. The way to get around this is to rewire the mind to show that forward motion was still there, it just doesnt seem that way because of how you were perceiving it.Change your perception of motion and you change your potential for happiness.I) PLAY THE CARDS IN FRONT OF YOUOne time I was playing poker at a club and Norm McDonald, the comedian, came in and started playing. He was a funny guy so there was a lot of chatter at the table.Norm would play every hand. Normally in poker youre probably dealt two hands an hour that are worth playing, and chances are youll lose at last 50% of those hands.But Norm played and raised and played and raised. He had a beautiful girl with him and it was no fun for him if he wasnt in the hand.So he lost all his money and then got more money out and then lost that and eventually left.Someone said afterwards, when Norm comes here its like a vacuum cleaner on his wallet.Too many people dont have the right preparation. They havent tested their product. They havent studied the game they are in. But they play as if they are already on top. Its not such a bad strategy to fake it til you make it. But make sure nobody knows you are doing that.The short cut in poker: dont bluff. If you have a good hand, play it. Count on the fact that someone else will bluff and you will make a lot of money.If you have pieces in chess that arent at their full potential (for example, there is a saying, a knight on the rim is dim) then play your cards by figuring out how to make that knight stronger in the next few moves.Dont go for a full out attack on the other persons king when your pieces are not really in place for it. Too many people do that.Just play what is in front of you. Improve incrementally and be PATIENT. You will have your chance to win many times. But you will lose ALL of your chances if you waste them.J) A BAD PLAN IS BETTER THAN NO PLANPeter Thiel told me that on our podcast. He was referring to business. Guess what? Peter Thiel is also a very strong chess master and the saying A bad plan is better than no plan is a saying in chess.Having a bad plan gives you several things:\\nrealization that you need a plan\\nopportunities to see if that plan is not working\\nways to analyze when the plan goes awry\\na chance to change the plan if its not working.\\nHaving no plan gives you none of these opportunities to get better.K) Maybe most important: THE THREAT IS STRONGER THAN THE EXECUTIONI remember studying a match in, I think, 1984, between the British chess champion, Nigel Short, and the US Champion, Lev Alburt.The British Champion wiped him out. Im not going to google it but I think the final score was 9-1.When I studied the games I noticed that the British champion was constantly bothering the US champion. He would make non-stop, but frivolous threats, against Lev Alburts queen.Alburt wasnt going to lose his queen but he had to waste a move getting his queen safe. Eventually Nigel Short would have the better position because he had gained so much time by threatening non-stop.Microsoft always announces software years before its done. This is called vaporware but nobody really knows whether or not there vaporware will become real or not so this often dissuades competitors.H. Ross Perot used to buy up shares of a big company (for instance, GM) and start shouting how poorly the company was run and that he could do a better job. He wasnt really going to take over the company but many people thought he was because of his threats and they would start buying up shares.Then he would sell his shares after they had run up significantly (or a company like GM would pay him off in a process called greenmail) and he would make a lot of money.---I love games. Any game. And, for me, studying the subtleties of games are like studying a bible. The metaphors to life are so real that Ive learned to live my life by the above rules.Recently, Claudia and I have been playing an Argentinian card game called Truco. We can play for hours. Half of the time she is screaming (she will deny this but I have a positive score against her).I can see there is a lot of strategy in the game. But the game is VERY Argentinian. For instance, if I google strategy for Truco, it doesnt give me the strategic tips I expect. It just says to joke and talk louder than your opponent so they get distracted.This strikes me as typical Argentina, a country settled hundreds of years ago by pirates escaping the law rather than by Puritans escaping religious persecution.Truco is actually a beautiful game and I love its subtleties.But when we are done playing, ultimately I love the person I am playing with.This is how you master the game of life.]',\n",
       "  84: '[I moved to NYC at the end of the world. Nobody knew about the \"World Wide Web\" but they would within the year.All the porn shops on 42nd street were shut down but they had yet to be destroyed. I had left my friends behind in another city and had yet to meet a single new friend.All I cared about was playing chess, writing, and meeting girls, in reverse order.I\\'d dress up in my one suit, take the bus for 1.5 hours into NYC, and stumble out of Grand Central to walk to the two blocks to HBO, a company where every day I was on the verge of getting fired my first six months there. 10,000 other people swarming in the same direction, in their same suits.To make friends I\\'d introduce myself to everyone who would make eye contact with me. I think I asked every girl I saw out on a date, including the girl behind the plate glass counter I had to pay when my phone bill was late. (She said, \"Yes\", we went on one date, and she stopped returning my calls).Like anyone in their 20s I wanted to change the world, create art, and get rich. Or maybe just one of those. I had no idea. Maybe even more important: I was just lonely and wanted someone to touch.The world seemed like a dream to me. Leaving the bus station I\\'d think to myself, \"I\\'m in the FAMOUS New York City.\" It was a champagne bottle waiting to pop and I was the cork, ready to fly into space.I think Disney owned the porn shops on 42nd Street and big plans were being made. We were all at the beginning of BIG PLANS.But this was in that gray transition period. I can\\'t think of a day in 1994 that wasn\\'t gray. Half dark, half light.And it was during this time that each porn shop, for whatever reason, had a haiku on them.For a very brief time, the wisdom of a god was scrawled onto each porn front. Everyone who had to squeeze their way down 42nd Street into the vast wide opening of the \"real world\" had to read these messages from above.Here\\'s one of those haikus and I still have it hanging by my desk.(Photo by Arthur; photo below courtesy of Sheri Lucia)]',\n",
       "  85: '[ On Friday everyone said YES to a $50 million deal. My consulting fee would\\'ve been huge. I dreamt about it.On Monday I got the call: the deal is off. As these things go, all of the reasons presented to me made no sense. When deals go astray the answers NEVER make sense. Some guy was rambling and I just kept saying \"uh-huh\". Then the call was over and I had to return to reality.I was f&amp;/?ing disappointed.I went back into my breakfast meeting. I had no time to cry or feel bad or anything. I couldn\\'t give any sign that I was miserable. I needed to have a good breakfast meeting. It was about making contacts for my podcast and meeting a new friend.Not that I am so stoic. I felt like someone had just taken a s**t on me and then kicked me into the street during a rainstorm and then left me there.Maybe some people have been kicked to the street like that and I admit I don\\'t know exactly what that feels like but that\\'s what I felt like.Failure feels really bad. Don\\'t let anyone tell you it doesn\\'t. Don\\'t let anyone tell you, \"we only learn from failure\".I also learn when I kiss. Or when I am kind to someone. Or when someone is kind to me. I learn when I read. I learn when I sleep and the dreams reignite parts of my brain I thought were dead.There are many other was to learn than feeling really bad.I learn when I am honest to someone, and how good honesty makes me feel. I learn when I clean myself and feel like a new person.My ratio of failure to success is about 20:1 in every area of my life: writing, business, friendships, relationships.20 to 1. It used to be 100 to 1. I get better at things sometimes.Most businesses I\\'ve started have failed. Most deals I try to do fail. My things I write I have to throw away. Many of my family don\\'t speak to me for their own reasons, and friends sometimes appear for a brief moment in the time of my life and then disappear, never to be seen again.I cry over each failure. I mourn every single one of them.But then, as close as they were to me, as emotional as they were to me, they were the sun forcing my flower to bloom and then I wilted and died, I still have to say goodbye to them.It\\'s never a mistake to say good-bye to anyone.Goodbye keeps us young. Dwelling on the past propels us into the future, into aging, into decrepitude and pain and bitterness and blame and complaining.Yesterday I complained. \"if this had happened...\" or \"if he had shown up...\" or whatever. I complained. I drained. I blamed. I aged.Goodbye.And then something happens. I kiss my wife. I breathe. I finish my breakfast meeting. I meet new people. Create more invisible threads between me and everyone else. We live inside an enormous spider web threaded by human contactBlaming feels like a comfort. An escape. Complaining pretends to soothe. But it\\'s just a siren calling from the sea to drown you. Everyday I stay on my no-complaints diet. Or I try.I just need to say Good-bye. To stop the aging that the leathery finger of failure beckons to me from the shadows. Hooded, yellow eyes, fear, \"come here, James. Stay with me for awhile. Stay with me for part of your life so neither of us are alone.\" The finger... barely out of the shadows. Come here.Goodbye.- - -I am giving away 29 of my favorite books for free.

       "  86: '[\"Why are you even doing this podcast?\" Dave asked me.\"Because I love my guests. I get to pick up the phone and call them and ask them anything I want.\"From Peter Thiel to Mark Cuban to Coolio to Marni Kirnys, I simply love them. And maybe Coolio would never talk to me unless I had something called a \"podcast\".I don\\'t even know what that stupid word means. Am I sitting in some sort of \"pod\" like Major Tom. Is ground control listening to me talk to Arianna Huffington?One person said to me: \"But there\\'s no theme. You talk to entrepreneurs, rappers, random writers... JUST WHAT IS YOUR THEME?\" He really wanted to know.Humans are NOT themes. Coolio was talking to me about the value of the US dollar. Mark Cuban telling me what he was doing the second he became a billionaire. Geoffrey Miller telling me about the evolution of sex. Humans aren\\'t themes. Humans want to reach out and touch each other. They want to connect. They want to have something they leave behind.I open the door and say, you can come over here and leave something behind that hopefully people will listen to and enjoy for years.Yesterday I read a book that was a pageturner. I was on a train from Baltimore to New York. It was a book about nothing to do with anything I\\'ve ever read before.I noticed the author has another book coming out in November. He has 10 or so New York Times Bestsellers behind him.As soon as I was done with the book I wrote to him and said, \"Can I talk to you?\" And he wrote write back and said, \"Yes!\" And I said to myself \"Yay!\"I know the more times a day I say \"YAY!\" the longer I will live. Please please please promise me you will say \"Yay!\" a lot today.It might not work for you. But you can tell me later. We can play chess in the park when we are 100 years old and our backs hurt and we hold each other up when the day ends and the pieces are scattered by the wind, the game unfinished.By the time this post ends I am going make you say \"yay!\"Because I love my guests so much, and I love them because I mostly love their books, I want you to love them as much as I do and I want you have their books.I\\'ve picked out 29 of the books of my guests, some of them haven\\'t even appeared on the show yet.I want you to have them. All 29. I will pay for them. I gain nothing by doing this. You can have them in any form you want.I can\\'t give all 29 books to all the people who read this but I can give them to some people.

       "  87: '[90% of the feedback I got about \"Choose Yourself\" was about one thing: How to bridge harsh reality with the world of imagination: how to become an Idea Machine.For my whole life I felt like a stray dog, dashing around until I could survive in the jungle. But I was lost and it took a long time.And I get it. I was dead on the ground. I was broke. I was separated. I was fired. I was scared. Scared and lonely.Everywhere I looked I couldn\\'t believe people knew how to smile. They were faking it, I thought.In \"Choose Yourself\" I describe the first tiny steps I took to get off the ground.Well, actually, the second. Because the first was horribly embarrassing. I pretended to be a psychic on Craigslist just so I could make friends.But ignore that. I was lonely and just needed to reach out into space.Specifically, I tried to improve physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually each day. Just a little bit each day. The 1% rule. Improve 1% a day.They are all equally important. If you sit on a four legged chair, you are firm on the ground. A three-legged chair, and a strong wind will blow you over. And below that, you fall easily.But ideas are the currency of this economy. NOTHING else. Which drove me to my next book, \"The Choose Yourself Guide to Wealth\" I focus a lot more on ideas:\\nwhy ideas are the NEW CURRENCY of the 21st century, a century already defined by declining currencies and more volatile employment\\nwhy ideas are so closely linked to wealth\\nhow to create good ideas and sell them and negotiate the highest value for them.\\nhow to avoid other people\\'s bad ideas\\nThis is not a self-help book. It\\'s exactly what I did for myself. I know it worked for me. I had ideas first, wealth second. It ONLY worked in that direction.At my worst moments, I had no ideas. All I could do was work on the ideas for others, even bad ideas, because I needed a paycheck.Then I had bad ideas. But bad ideas come back at you with loan shark prices and you HAVE to pay.Good ideas are a link between the real world and the world of myths and dreams.I needed to survive, I needed to pay for my family. I was going through a divorce. I was dating people maybe not so good for me. I was miserable all the time and I was scared it was only going to get worse.And often it did get worse. Often there is no bottom until you make the active effort to climb out of the hole which I did by keeping my health up and being only around people who loved me and who I loved.But then I created the attached image. This is when I finally took the red pill instead of the blue pill: THE IDEA MATRIX (see the attached image).And ever since, my life has 100% changed every six months. I can\\'t even believe the ways in which it has changed. I can\\'t say better or worse. But I\\'m not crying on the floor anymore, pretending to be a psychic.- - -The bottom axis starts off when you are working solely on the ideas of others.This is not necessarily bad but it basically means you are an employee and you are an idea slave to someone else\\'s whims.You could get fired. Your boss could have bad ideas and go broke. There is no loyalty. You are not in control. You feel \"stuck\" all the time.On the top right is when you are an idea machine: you are non-stop working on good ideas that help the lives of others. You mind dips into dreams and you make them reality or art or abundance.Peter Thiel underlined this for me when he told me the story of Mark Zuckerberg turning down Yahoo\\'s offer of $1 billion. Zuckerberg would\\'ve made $250 million. Peter wanted him to take, or at least consider, the idea.Zuckerberg decided in ten minutes time: \"No\".As Peter put it: ideas were more valuable to Mark than money.Not everyone is going to create Facebook. I never will. But everyone could create abundance in this upper right corner. Wealth is the side effect of being an idea machine.- - -I\\'ve been at the bottom left corner many times. When I was working a job where I\\'d keep my office door locked all day long. I had to write an instruction manual for some chip.I was horrible at it. You see how many grammar mistakes I make in these posts? I was worse then.My boss even called me into his office and yelled at me, \"don\\'t you take any pride in your work?\"I\\'d leave work at 4:45 on the dot every day so I could hitch hike home. I wrote horrible novels at night. I hung out with my friends. I lived with a woman I didn\\'t love. Nothing was going well. I was an idea slave.Many employees are at the bottom left. They get their paycheck, their hours are filled from 9-5 or more just working on the bad ideas of others.This is not a natural state for human beings. We NEED to explore. We\\'re curious. We want to adapt constantly to new environments and use the part of our brain that evolved specifically so we could create new works of art or production.But we\\'ve been fooled into thinking by a century of corporatism that if we just \"pay our dues\" and climb \"the ladder\" then there is a pot of gold at the end.This loyalty never existed and is now gone forever as people slowly adapt to a new world.- - -In the bottom right: where you have bad ideas but you are giving ideas to others.Many professions exist here: lawyers and stockbrokers are the most common. Tons of ideas but they are usually bad.This is not such a horrible thing for society. But it requires the customers to be aware of the hidden agendas of the lawyers and brokers (the fees, being charged by the hour, etc).Not all lawyers and brokers are bad. But their job is to give you a ton of ideas and hope for the best.\"Where Are The Customers Yachts?\" is a famous book about this corner.When I\\'ve been a consultant for companies trying to figure out what to do with their websites I was mostly in this category. Lots of ideas, most of them bad, but I needed the client to say \"yes\" so I can charge for more websites.Getting HBO to pay $75,000 for a three page website about Dennis Miller was my crowning achievement as a bottom-righter.- - -At the top left is when you are working on good ideas but based off of other people\\'s ideas. Whoever created Gmail on top of Google is in this category.Whoever buys a losing business and turns it around is here. There is money here, just not as much as the upper right.I was in this category when I worked at HBO. I was initially hired to do some basic computer programming for them (idea slave) but then I started pitching them ideas that I could do for their website.I was still under their umbrella but I was able to become an \"entre-ployee by working on good ideas within the umbrella idea of \"HBO\".I made more money this way, had some fun, got some promotions, but I was still an employee.- - -See in the middle where it says \"disobedience\"? I don\\'t mean like a kid running away from home for the first time. Because the kid always comes back. I came back. Again and again.This is where you break free from the system. Where you realize that everything is a stage set and now it\\'s time to get to work.This is where you say \"sorry\" instead of asking for permission.This is where you wake up and everyone\\'s attached to a tube and you pull the tube out and maybe then, just like in the movies, you learn karate and fall in love.- - -At the top right is the IDEA MACHINE.Nothing can stop you.This is where abundance is. This is where seeds are planted. This is where you dip into other dimensions not yet created.A few months ago I wrote Amazon a list: 10 Ideas for Amazon to Improve their Self-publishing division. They liked the list.They flew me out there, showed me all the different departments, showed me what they were working on, and it was a lot of fun.I even took a photo of the very first Starbucks.They didn\\'t pay me but I got to meet everyone, I got to be at the center of the universe for publishing, and I planted a seed.Who knows where those seeds can grow in the future and what abundance can be created. The top-righter idea machine plants lots of seeds. Builds many bridges into the world of dreams.But we have to pay the bills.I\\'ve also made a lot of money in this area. One time I had a set of ideas for a company. They invited me to go on their board where I ended up making a lot of money as they implemented my ideas. This has happened to me many many times.Just yesterday I spoke to someone and gave him five ideas for how he could build a substantial business. I didn\\'t mention my involvement at all. But if he does well, I\\'ll do well. It always works out this way.Every day I try to plant seeds.What about big companies, like Facebook or Apple. Are they in this quadrant?Of course! Facebook is a great example: they set up the platform so that everyone can aggregate information about their identity into one place. They basically generate non-stop ideas for a billion different people around the world who want to communicate and share their online identities.Despite all the complaints you read in the media, everyone I know uses Facebook, including the people making the complaints.- - -Claudia asked me about Marcus Lemonis, who stars in The Profit and I\\'ve been begging to get on my podcast. \"Where is he on this matrix?\"Two places. He buys declining businesses and helps turn them around. This is in the top left: take an idea from someone else and start to throw good ideas at it.But he\\'s also in the top right. He\\'s an idea machine.He takes his simple concept of turning around companies, applies it to MANY companies and now he\\'s making a TV show out of it. He gets 40,000 emails for help from business each week. What a way to guarantee he has non-stop opportunities!Where are you on this matrix right now? Where can you be in six months?- - -When I was a kid I looked up to my dad. I thought he was an idea machine. No matter what the problem, he had a solution. If I argued back, he\\'d show me where I was wrong. And I was always wrong.He built up a good business and went public. But then it went bankrupt, he went broke, he got depressed, and he let it stop him. I don\\'t know if he ever had a good idea again.At my worst moments I thought I was turning into him. I would cry to therapists that I was turning into him. Someone who would sit all day and do nothing until he died. They would assure me for $200/hr that I wasn\\'t. But how could they know?But the daily practice I describe everywhere gives me the energy to come up with ideas, and to come up with ideas for coming up with ideas. I write down ten ideas a day no matter what.Being scared and lonely happens in a cycle. It effects all of us. Even a little bit each day. Watching the river go into the ocean sparks a little bit of that loneliness.We\\'re meant to often feel lonely and scared. It allows us to re-calibrate where we are and ask the important question: is this what I\\'m supposed to be doing right now?When I am most fearful is EXACTLY the time when I want my idea muscle humming, when I MUST write those ten ideas a day down and become an idea machine.It\\'s when I\\'m most scared that I get out of bed and I know that today is the day I can do anything I want to.It\\'s not an affirmation. Or wishful thinking. Or the words of a song.It\\'s a box I check when I\\'m done writing my ideas down.KA-BOOM!Photo: *vlad* / Flickr]',\n",
       "  88: '[Youre on the most important elevator ride of your life. You have ten seconds to pitch- the classic elevator pitch.Love or Hate. Money or Despair. And you may never get this chance again. As PM Dawn says, I feel for you. I really do.There are books about this. But dont waste your time. They are all garbage.Ive been on both sides of this equation. Ive had people pitching me.But mostly, Ive been scared and desperate and afraid to ask someone to give me, want me, love me, all in the space of an elevator ride or in the time it takes one to ride an elevator.Perhaps the hardest thing for me was when I was doing my 3am web series for HBO.I had to walk up to random strangers at 3 in the morning on the streets of New York and convince them within 5 seconds to spill their most intimate secrets to me rather than kill me.Not quite an elevator pitch but the same basic idea. I had a lot of practice. I probably approached over 3000 people cold.In some cases people tried to kill me. In one case I was chased. In other cases people opened up their hearts and I am infinitely grateful to them.The ideas below have worked for me in the hundreds of times Ive had to be persuasive. Either in writing, or in person. In business and in friendships and in love. I hope variations on it can work for you. You decide.A) WHO ARE YOU?People want to know they are talking to a good, honest, reliable person that they can trust and perhaps even like, or love.Yes, love.They wont love you by looking at your resume.You have to do method acting. Imagine what your body would feel like if they already said Yes even before you open your mouth.You would be standing up straight, smiling, palms open, ready to close the deal. You have to method act at the beginning of your pitch.If you are slouched and your head is sticking out then your brain is not as well-connected to your nervous system and you wont be in flow.I can drag out the science here but this is a Facebook status update and not a peer-reviewed scientific paper for the Justice League of America.The reality is: when youre slouched over, not only are you not using the full potential of your brain, but you look untrustworthy.B) RELAXThink about how you breathe when you are anxious and nervous.I will tell you how I breathe: short, shallow breaths in my upper chest.So do the reverse before a ten second pitch.Breathe deep and in your stomach. Even three deep breaths in the stomach (and when you exhale try to imagine your stomach almost hitting your back) has been shown to totally relax the mind and body.People sense this. Again, this builds trust and relaxes you.Now, even though you havent said a single word, youve probably done the two most important things for persuading someone.C) UHHH. YEAH. UHHH. MMMM-HMMM. UH-HUHI have a hard time with this. It seems natural to say, yup or right or uh-huh or whatever.But heres the facts (and, again, theres been studies on this): people perceive you as stupid when you do this.Just keep quiet when someone is talking.Then, when someone is done speaking, wait for two seconds before responding. They might not be done yet. And it gives you time to think of a response. If you are thinking of a response while they are talking, then you arent listening to them.People unconsciously know when you are not listening to them. Then they say No to you.D) THE SIX UsFINALLY, now were getting to the heart of the matter. THE ACTUAL NUTS AND BOLTS OF PERSUASIONBy the way, Ive googled the 4 Us and each time I get a different set of 4. So Im going to use the 4 that have worked for me the best.This is not BS. This is not a way to convince someone to do something they dont want to do. This is a way for you to consolidate your vision into a sentence or two and then express it in a clear manner.This is the way to bond and connect with another persons needs instead of just your own pathetic wants.You can use this in an elevator pitch, on a date, with your children, on your mother, whatever. But it works.Think about these things when talking:\\nUrgencyWhy the problem you solve is URGENT to your demographic. For example: I can never get a cab when it rains!\\nUniqueWhy is your solution unique: We aggregate 100s of car services into one simple app. Nobody else does this.\\nUsefulWhy is your solution useful to the lives of the people you plan on selling to or deliver your message to: We get you there on time.\\nUltra-SpecificThis shows there is no fluff: Our app knows where you are. Your credit card is pre-loaded. You hit a button and a car shows up in 4-5 minutes.Of course the example I give is for Uber but you can throw in any other example you want.Ill throw in a fifth U\\nUser-friendlyIn other words, make it as easy as possible for someone to say yes. Like a money back guarantee, for instance. Or a giveaway. Or higher equity. Or testimonials from people you both know. Etc.OH! And before I forget, a sixth U\\nUnquestionable ProofThis can be in the form of profits. Or some measurable statistic. Or testimonials. Or a good wing-man. Whatever it takes.\\nE) DESIREA lot of people say you have to satisfy the desires of the other person in order for them to say yes.As much as we would like to think otherwise, people primarily act out of self-interest.The less they know you, the more they will act of self-interest because to do otherwise could potentially put them in danger. We all know that kids shouldnt take candy from strangers.In an elevator pitch, the investor is the kid, what you are asking is the candy, and you are the stranger. So their gut reflex, unless you make the candy super-sweet, is to say no.So make sure you make your candy sweeter by sprinkling in their desires.And what are their desires?\\nrecognition\\nrejuvenation\\nrelaxation\\nrelief\\nreligion\\nremuneration\\nresults\\nrevenge\\nromance\\nIf you can help them solve these URGENT problems or desires, then you they are more likely to say yes to you.I dont know what you are selling, but hopefully its not to satisfy their desire for revenge. But if it is, dont do anything violent.The one time I had to sell romance on an elevator I had to do three things: tell her life would be ok, make sure I knew her address and last name, and send her a teddy bear and flowers the next day.But thats for another story.BUT FIRSTF) OBJECTIONSEveryone is going to have gut objections.Theyve been approached 1000s of times before.Do you know how many times Ive been approached to have sex in an elevator?None.But probably many others have and you have to put up with their non-stop objection.I will list them and then give solutions in parentheses:\\nNo time(thats ok. Its on an elevator. So they have elevator-length time. The key here is to stand straight and act like someone who deserves to be listened to).\\nNo interest(you solve this by accurately expressing the urgency of the problem)\\nNo perceived difference(but you have your unique difference ready to go)\\nNo belief(offer unquestionable proof that this works)\\nNo decision(make their decision as user-friendly as possible)\\n- - -With great power comes great responsibility.Most people dont have the power of persuasion. They mess up on each of the points Ive outlined above. It takes practice and hard work.But this is not just about persuasion. Its about connection.Its about two people, who are probably strangers, reaching through physical and mental space and trying to understand each other and reach common ground.Its not about money. Its not about the idea. Its not about yes or no.Its about two people falling in love.(Photo by Marco Wessel)]',\n",
       "  89: '[   A friend of mine was a professional Madam. She lived on my floor at the Chelsea Hotel.Beautiful women would come in and out of her apartment. For some reason, she also had a valet, who worked for her for free because he was obsessed with her.The police finally caught her. She had many high-profile clients  businessmen, movie directors, police.She had an arrangement with the florist down the street who would take credit cards for her in exchange for 20%.She used to be a regular on Howard Stern where she would brag about what she did but she felt fearless and that the law would never catch her because of who her clients were.She was a lesbian and all the women who worked for her were lesbians. She didnt want them to have any emotional attachments to the men. Before she would hire a new prostitute she would try out the woman herself.When she was caught, she was eventually acquitted but she paid a $2 million fine. Then she moved to Florida and started a clothing store. Clearly she had saved much more money than the $2 million.When you work a standard desk job you never have to worry about being caught. Life will be calm life will be quiet until maybe one day it turns upside down.At some point we all get caught. The system will change. A boss will get upset. A company will get downsized. A loved one will die.What happens next is what determines how we survive and live for the rest of our lives. This is the task we are given when we are born.We were alone then. We are alone now. Not in a bad way. Just reality.My friend didnt have a standard desk job. Her job was much riskier, much more filled with chances and excitement and fear. So she got paid more for this risk, had her ups and downs, how a Plan B, and now owns her own storeuntil her next adventure.The man at the standard desk job might get fired. Or might get too old. Or might get replaced by someone with similar skills and much lower pay demands.And then what will he do? What is Plan B?- - -Another friend of mine drives a black SUV and started his own private limousine company. On Friday and Saturdays he drives 17 or 18 hours a day. I make anywhere from $500 a week to $5000 a week, depending on how much I drive.He also designed his own fashion line, has 100,000 Instagram followers and is starting to get noticed at conventions where new designers display their fashions.I think in two or three years I will switch full time to the fashion business but well see. I learn more every day. Im always meeting people.Before this, he was a network technician. His clients loved him and he knew how to fix technical problems. But his boss didnt like him.I dont know what I did wrong. he told me. But one day he called me and told me not to come into work the next day. I was fired.I couldnt get a job. I had nothing to do. And I was scared.Now my life is my own and every day I meet new people and I make as much or little as I want and I have time to work on my designs. I love to talk to people but I also love to be creative and now I can do both. - - -Theres nothing wrong with a job. You might love your job, your colleagues, what you do, your boss, and your fixed salary that goes up once a year at a rate slightly slower than the rate of inflation.The key is to have a Plan B and even a Plan C.The system we were trained to grow up in (standardized tests, college, low-level jobs, own a home, have a family, owe more and more to the banks and the government, higher and higher level jobs, decent retirement account, retirement, some travel, death) works for a small percentage of people.Many people try to make it work for them. Maybe 80% of people start off in the system. Maybe 5% of people remain in the system.The rest of us are stabbed in our attempts to hang onto that final rung in the ladder. If onlyIf only.I can climb up one more rung in the ladder Ill be safe. SAFE!- - -It took me a long time to come up with a Plan B. I was working for HBO and I thought the only thing I wanted to do in my life was rise up in the ranks and maybe even have a TV show.When things werent working out I would cry and think, WHY!? Why me? Why does it work out for everyone else but me? even though it was clearly not working out for anyone else, my brain had singled me out for its own brand of punishment.My brain hated me. It would wake me at three in the morning and yell at me until I cried in frustration that it wouldnt shut up.Then I had a Plan B. And a Plan C.But they didnt work out.So I needed a Plan D.But that didnt work out.Finally I needed Plan E- Q all simultaneously.A week ago, Plan J didnt work out for me. A business Im involved in completely failed.Instead of being upset about this I was able to console the entrepreneur who had put his life savings in Plan J and had no idea what he was going to do next. He now owes debts and the IRS and every direction he turned said no to him. His next challenge is winding things down and preserving his marriage.I hope he will develop his next plans. The world weeds people out. If he does develop his next plans he will be stronger and some of them will work and society will benefit.The system teaches you to think the Plan B is failure. (B is worse than A in the alphabet).Its not a failure if you have to resort to Plan B. Or even Plan Z. You will be stronger, happier, the people around you will benefit, and society will benefit from having toughened you up for what you now deliver to it.Its the BEGINNING of success when you start having multiple plans. Life is not a bullet going in a straight line but a scattershot that hits every possible future.Some of those futures are where you will make your impact but you dont know which one. You may never know.If your plan relies on any one person to judge it a success or a failure, then you will fail. Because nobody else cares about you. They may seem like they do, as long as it corresponds with their plans. But once it doesnt, then you are on your own.How do you come up with Plan B? How do you come up with Plan C? Or Plan Z?Right now you might feel safe. You might feel, I dont need a Plan B. This is working out for me just fine right now.This is not just about money. But about relationships. About romance. About your creativity. About your inspirations. About your spiritual life. About kindness to others. About your health. They are all linked.Its hard work to get from birth to death. The worst thing to ever happen to us was being born. And then having to come up with all of these plans.But the universe wants to see what you come up with. Thats the only reason it exists.- - -My friend, the madam, asked me if I wanted to try out one of her girls. We used to take walks up and down the stairs of the Chelsea Hotel every day.This was our exercise and she would tell me her stories. I was of course very curious how she ran her business. I was getting an MBA up and down that staircase.I said no, although this seems unbelievable now as I write this. I wasnt interested. I only wanted to be with a woman who actually liked me. Which was rare!To be honest, I had a crush on the girl who was the madam. I told her so but she laughed and said, only women for me.Now the Chelsea has closed down. She was caught by the police. I quit my job, then lost my business, and on and on.Today Im staying in the apartment of a friend high above central park with views of the entire park. I got here yesterday and will leave tomorrow and never stay here again.Claudia did a handstand in the window, overlooking the park, and I took a photo of it. It was fun and beautiful.That was my Plan B for today. Later I will come up with ten new ideas for Plan C for tomorrow.Every day I write down ten to twenty ideas for what I could do thats new and creative and innovative. Some make money, some dont. I have plans for everything.Most of the plans are laughably bad. But sometimes a good one happens. And it explodes like magic into my life.And in the meantime, if Im lucky, I will stay alive. ALIVE!]',\n",
       "  90: '[When I start to date a woman, I want her to love me IMMEDIATELY. That never happens. Youre going too fast, and she ends it.When I started a novel when I was younger, I wanted to finish it the next day. When I start a business, I want to sell it a day later. Count the riches. When I started graduate school, I was already planning how I was going to be the fastest PhD in history.Around the time that I had initially planned on receiving that Phd , I ended up getting thrown out. Lack of maturity, the letter said.I dont believe life is short. Sometimes it feels very very long. Like I wish every day would be over already just so I can get to the next. And the next.An imaginary tomorrow always seems to be better than today in my head.Which makes me think of my hero, Gene Wolfe.I know what you might be thinking.Pringles.Gene Wolfe was given the task of how do you take a baked potato, press it down, and slice it up in such a way that it can fit into a tennis ball can.Well, my man did it. He invented Pringles. And I ate one this morning.But thats not why hes my hero.While many normal human beings, not as obsessed with status and creativity as Gene was, might say: Ok, I just did my lifes achievement. Ive achieved my PURPOSE. Ive created an easily storable food based on a vegetable that, when doused with a ton of salt, will please children and adults for decades, maybe centuries.I mean, what would you do at that point?If I were Gene (and I almost hate using his first name, as if I knew him when its only in my dreams I imagine having dinner with him and OH, the things we would talk about, the laughs we would have) I wouldve rested on my laurels, collected awards, imagined playing golf with friends, can of Pringles always in tow, maybe a little belly develops but hey, he deserved it. He EARNED it.But Gene knew the magic secret. And it is only with his lifetime (and at 83 hes still going) that he is able to share that secret.The secret: One page a day.Gene has been an adult for almost 25,000 days.He writes a page a day. A page is about 300 words. A paragraph or two. Can you do that? 25,000 pages. About 80 books worth of pages.Gene ended up writing 50 published novels, including many bestsellers and award-winners.He didnt get stereotyped and stuffed into that Pringles can. As dead as the chips he created.He did what he loved to do. Thats what keeps you alive every day. Thats The Push.Life is too long to reject the opportunities in front of you every day.I was talking to James Manos, the creator of Dexter. He said, my definition of success is if you cant distinguish between work and pleasure.Its ok if right now the two are separate for you. Today is a new day.We repent what we want to change. We regret what we never changed.This is my page today.Photo by sebikus / shutterstock]',\n",

To get good at something you need: a teacher, a passion, read a lot of books, practice 3-4 hours a day for many days.There are no shortcuts to learning something. In general:\\nIt will take you 1 year of serious study to be in the top 60% of anything in life.\\nIt will take you 2 years to be in the top 50% (the learning curve slope starts to flatten)\\nIt will take you 3 years to be in the top 30% (where you will start making money at your passion)\\nIt will take you 4 years to be in the top 10-20% (where you will start to make real wealth)\\nIt will take you 5+ years to be in the top 10% where you will make real wealth. I\\'ve switched careers many times.\\nEven if you have every lifehack in the book, this is what it takes to be GREAT at something you love doing. Great enough to make a living or even wealth at it.I\\'ve done enough interviews now on my podcast with people who the best in the world at what they do and I can see there are no real shortcuts.This is true no matter what field.So instead, I\\'m going to tell you four dumb things I do that I have fun with and has made life A LOT smoother for me. I like to be calm, to laugh, to have fun with friends, to be creative, to wake up excited for what the day holds for me.FOUR LIFEHACKS THAT WORK FOR ME TWO DOLLAR BILLS.I have thousands of $2 bills. I always tip with $2 bills. How come? Because then people remember me. They always say, \"whoah! I\\'ve never had one.\"And then the next time I come into an establishment, I\\'m remembered. This is good for restaurants, dates, poker night with friends, even for paying at the local deli.I also find whenever I move to a new town this is a quick way to make friends. I\\'m very shy and this gets people talking. This has been also very good on dates. Nobody ever forgets the guy with a roll of $2 bills. DOCTOR\\'S COAT.I wear a doctor\\'s lab coat most of the time. Like in airports, restaurants, walking around town.The reason?a. It\\'s comfortable.b. The big pockets let me put any electronic devices I might need (an ipad mini, for example, plus waiter\\'s pads (see below))c. People actually do treat me like a doctor. If someone said, \"I need a doctor\" I would not be able to help (unless it\\'s easy stuff in which case I can say, \"I\\'m not a doctor\" and then perform CPR or mouth-to-mouth or Heimlich, which are all easy to learn.But the reality is, people move out of the way if you are an airport and walking around in a doctor\\'s coat. And in a restaurant sometimes people let me go first.Is this unfair? Well, I never claim to be a doctor. I\\'m just wearing a doctor\\'s coat because I like how it feels, looks, and the functionality of it. But if it has other benefits, which it does, I\\'ll take it.Besides, 99.99% of the time someone goes to the doctor here is the correct answer the doctor should give: \"Go home and sleep more. Call me in a year.\" WAITER\\'S PADS.I have about 300 waiter\\'s pads. I order them for about 10 cents a pad in bulk on restaurant supplies website.How come?a. I like to write ideas on pads. I write down at least 10 ideas a day. The idea muscle is a muscle like any other. If it\\'s not exercised, it atrophies. If it\\'s exercised then within six months you\\'re an idea machine. Try it. It\\'s amazing what happens. Don\\'t keep track of the ideas. Just become an idea machine.b. Why a pad? A screen messes with your dopamine levels. I like the visceral experience of putting pen to pad.c. Why ten ideas? Four or five ideas on any theme is easy. It\\'s the final five or six that makes the brain sweat. This is how you exercise the idea muscle.d. Why specifically a waiter\\'s pad?i. It forces you to be concise. A waiter\\'s pad is small lines. You can\\'t write a novel there.ii. It\\'s a great conversation piece in meetings. Once I pull out the waiter\\'s pad someone always says, \"I\\'ll take fries with my burger\" and everyone laughs. Again, I\\'m shy so it\\'s a good way for me to break the ice.iii. In restaurants, when you pull out a waiter\\'s pad, guess what? Waiters treat you better.iv. The other day in a cafe I was working and someone potentially violent came up and asked me for money. I held up my waiter\\'s pad and said, \"I\\'m a waiter, do you want to order something?\" and they sort of looked at me and grunted and then walked away. WATCH STANDUP COMEDY before every meeting, date, dinner, media appearance, conversation, public talk.I watch Louis CK, Daniel Tosh, Amy Schumer, Anthony Jeselnik, Jim Norton, Andy Samberg, Seth Rogen, Marina Franklin, Ellen, Bo Burnham, and maybe a dozen others.How come?I have a lot of inhibitions when I meet people. I\\'m scared and somewhat introverted. Standup comedians are the best public speakers in the world and I think they are the most astute social commentators on the human condition.So the reasons I watch them before most social encounters (personal, professional, media)\\nit gives me a boost of energy. My \"mirror neurons\" are going to feed off of their boost of energy for at least 1-3 hours after I watch them.\\nit gives me material. I won\\'t steal from a comedian (yes I will). But the reality is: good artists plagiarize, great artists steal. And at the very least, I often improvise based on material I heard a comedian said. I\\'m not competing with them. I\\'m just on a date. Or a business meeting.\\nStudying the subtleties of how comedians get laughs: their timing, their voices, their silences, the way they look at the audience, the way they move across the stage, the way they benefits from the comedians who came before them, AND their actual commentary about life, helps me in my many interactions with people.\\nAll of the above may make it seem like I\\'m a loser in many respects. I don\\'t deny this. Loser of what? Remember those nine trillion years?Anyway, this is the four insanely stupid things that I wanted to share.And they work.]',\n",
       "  92: '[I know why Im not a billionaire. Other than having the consistent self-sabotaging quality of destroying money in massive bonfires every time I sell a company, I also have a severe psychosocial disorder which makes me a horrible connector of people.Connecting people who can benefit each other is the most useful skill you can have on the entrepreneurial ladder of skills. When you help others make money by connecting them together, the world forces itself into the Mbius strip of success that brings the money right back to you times ten. Some billionaires are great at it. If I write Mark Cuban an email he responds in two seconds even though he doesnt even know me. Hes a Super Connector. I know quite a few talented super connectors and they will be very successful as they grow into future Mark Cubans.[See, \"How I Helped Mark Cuban Make a Billion Dollars and 5 Other Things I learned from him\".](I wish I were him)Im horrible at following up. I also burn bridges. I used to play a nice social game of Wordtwist on Facebook every day with Don Graham, the publisher/owner of the Washington Post. Then I wrote a blog post, . Guess what. He doesnt play Wordtwist with me anymore. Another time I was trying to get a job working for the hedge fund manager Stevie Cohen. He wanted me to share a few trades with him as I was doing them. We IMed back and forth a bit during the trades. One trade didnt work out and I was ashamed of it. So I stopped IMing him. After a few days of this billionaire IMing me with, Whered you go? I blocked him on my IM list and that was that.But that said, I love meeting new people and Ive always done a good job with the initial skills involved with meeting new people. I feel like I can meet anyone in the world that I want to. Whether I make use of that meeting is another story. In fact, its a fairy tale. Because I seldom do the follow up correctly.But here are the 9 Skills You Need to Become a Super-Connector.1. Introduce two other connectors  this is an unbelievable technique. If you can introduce two people who are themselves great connectors then you become a meta-connector. They will meet and get along (connectors get along with each other for two reasons: they are naturally friendly people (hence their ability to connect so easily with people) and they have a lot of friends in common almost by definition.) If you are in the middle of that connection then they will always remember you and youll always be on their mind for future potential connections they can make that would be useful for you. And their rolodexes are immense. So if you need to meet Prince William of England, for instance, or Ellen Degeneres then just connect two connectors and the next thing you know youll be dancing right down the aisle with Ellen on her show or bowing to Kate Middleton, or whatever you want to do. Ellen? Kate? Uma?2. Introduce two people with an idea in mind: Marsha, meet Cindy. Cindy, meet Marsha. Marsha, you are the best book editor in the world. Cindy, your book is the best book idea I have ever heard. You both can make money together. No need to cc me.In other words, if you can help two other people make money then eventually, good things will happen to you. In cases where Ive been able to do this (rare, but its happened) I always tell people who say what can I do for you that if they ever find me in the gutter with blood leaking from my mouth and a needle sticking out of the veins in my elbow then at the very least pull the needle out. Thats all I ask. The first time I ever did this I went home (1994) and told my girlfriend, I just helped two people make money for the first time ever. And she said, yeah, but what did you get? I got nothing. But I felt something. I felt like I had done good in the world and that if I kept doing it, eventually it would return to me. And it did. With those very two people that first time but years later.3. Have a dinner of interesting people. Ive only done this twice. When the last Star Wars prequel came out I invited people from every aspect of my life (friends, hedge funds, writers) to a dinner, I got everyone movie tickets, and it was a fun night. I solidified my relationships with some of my investors, plus some of the funds I was invested in, and I managed to connect people up who later did business together. On another occasion I threw a party for everyone who had been fired by thestreet.com. It got a little awkward when the guy who had done most of the firing (who had himself been fired right before then) was also there but it was all in good fun. Not sure how much goodwill it created for me. Too early to tell.But, I much more enjoy going to the dinner that Im invited to. [See, \"Why a Grenade Needs to Get Thrown At Me\"]. Ive met a lot of interesting people. My main problem is that my normal bedtime is about 8pm. So sometimes I fall asleep at the table and everyone thinks Im on drugs. And other times I just cant go to the dinner because I know I wont be functional the next morning when I like to write. But sometimes I go just because my wife Claudia gets sick of having me around all the time and pushes me out the door. So please keep inviting me.4. Following up. This is the hardest part for me. I have a list five years old of people who introduced me to people I actually wanted to be introduced to and then I never followed up. For instance, a few months ago I wrote a post Burton Silverman, are you dead yet? Burton Silverman is one of my favorite artists. I wanted to know if he was dead to see if the value of one of his paintings had gone up. Guess what? He wrote me to tell me he wasnt dead yet. And as I type this, his studio is only a few blocks away. I could visit him right now if I want. Exceptfor some reason I never returned his email. Hes on my list. But followup is my hardest part. Then I put it off until I start to feel guilty about not following up. So then I push back the follow-up even more. At my first company I hired someone to follow up for me. Claudia tells me she will follow up for me on emails. But I have a hard time letting other people do things for me that I should really be doing for myself.But needless to say, if you make a connection, its so easy to keep it by just saying, hey, it was great meeting you. Lets do that again in a month or so. Why the hell cant I ever do easy things? Instead of writing this post I could simply write an email to 400 people on my list, including Silverman. Something is mentally wrong with me.5. Re-establishing Contact. The other day I was following my own advice. Im on the 21 Day Gratitude Diet I discuss in the post How Being Grateful Can Make You Rich. I wrote an email to an ex-investor of mine from 2004 saying sincerely how grateful I was he invested with me and I always enjoyed his advice and friendship. He immediately wrote back (because, unlike me, hes a good connector and businessman) and said, what are you up to? Heres what Im doing. Maybe we can work together again. This is 6 years after I last spoke to him. Guess what. Hes now on the list I mentioned in #4 above. Hes #401 on the list. But Ill get back to him. Maybe later today. After I get my drivers license. Because I promised Claudia 3 months ago that I would get it today although today means that day three months ago.6. Show Up. I dont know which rule on this list is the most valuable. But if a good connector invites you to a dinner or a meeting, then the best thing you can do is show up. I was invited to a party of 40 bloggers the other night. The guy doing the inviting was Michael Ellsberg who recently wrote the bestseller, The Education of Millionaires. More on him in a second. I probably shouldve gone. But 9pm! Thats like 8 hours past my bedtime. Still, I shouldve gone. Next time!7. Interview People. Back to Michael Ellsberg. This was genius. He figured he wanted to meet a lot of successful people (sort of like how Napoleon Hill did this when he wrote the bestseller Think and Grow Rich). So he got himself a book deal about how millionaires are educated and then, book deal in hand, he interviewed as many billionaires as he could find. The guy is now a MEGA-Connector. When I met him a few weeks ago he had non-stop ideas about how one goes about meeting people. He should give conferences or do coaching on this one aspect alone. Meanwhile, theres meI blew off his party last night and didnt respond to his last email. Hes on my list of emails to return.Ive done this technique to some extent. Writing for the Wall St Journal or Financial Times it was always fairly easy to get people on the phone or meet them at a breakfast. But I had a hard time following up. Anthony Scaramucci, for instance, is a well-known finance guyrunning one of the biggest funds of funds and also running the annual SALT conference where guys like Bill Clinton and Vladmir Putin will speak on the same stage (Mike Tyson had to break up the fist fight). I met Scaramucci through my writing (he has also written a book) and we had breakfast together and he asked me to run a panel at his SALT conference. Guess what? I didnt follow up. I didnt even return the calls of people on his staff. Bad James!When I was at HBO, I interviewed people for a living. The only problem is they were mostly transvestite prostitutes. But, I did get to meet the producers and creators of one of my favorite shows, Taxicab Confessions. This was back in 1996. One of them called me recently and wanted to get together. And guess what?8. Produce Something of Value. In order to connect two people, you must have people to connect. You have to meet them in the first place. The best way to do that is to produce something of value. In this post I described about how when I was broke and about to go homeless I tried a technique of just reaching out to people. I would write letters like, Hey, would love to meet. That never worked. People are busy. Nobody wanted to meet some random guy like me. So instead I tried a new technique. For each person I wanted to meet I would spend time researching their business and come up with 10 ideas that would help them that I would just completely give for free. With one guy (Jim Cramer), I came up with ten article ideas he should write. He ultimately wrote back, YOU should write these and that started my financial writing career. It also developed a culture of exchanging ideas with thestreet that ultimately led to me selling Stockpickr.com to them. With another guy, I gave him several trading system ideas and he ultimately allocated money for me to trade. This started my hedge fund trading career.I then write my first book about trading. Which led to Fidelity inviting me to speak at conferences, a good way to meet people. My next two talks for them are in Scottsdale, AZ and Las Vegas in the next few weeks. Ive been giving talks for them since 2004. I havent raised my prices since then because Im always too shy to talk about money except in passive-aggressive ways like writing this blog post.9. Time. I woke up for a few minutes at 3am this morning to write this list. Then I went back to sleep, figuring Id write the post when I woke up. The last item on the list I wrote at 3am is Time. But for the life of me I have no idea why I wrote it. If anyone can help me solve this mystery Id be grateful.Im going to get another coffee. Be right back...---Ok, I still dont know what Time means. But I do know Im late for my first breakfast for the day. I introduced the person I am meeting to this guy a few weeks ago and they had a good meeting. Maybe Ill finally learn to follow up by sending an email after the breakfast.---Subscribe to my FREE Email Newsletter.(Photo by Danny Bollinger)]',\n",
       "  93: '[ I owe you an apology. If Ive spoken on the phone with you at any point in the past four or five years then theres a decent chance (75%) that I was playing chess online at the same time. Im sort of embarrassed if you are reading this. But I wanted to come clean. Maybe by confessing Ill stop doing this bad behavior.Theres two aspects of that last sentence. Bad behavior  is it really? And by confessing Ill stop. I dont know if Ill really stop. Its an addiction. I cant help myself. If I even hear the sound of my phone ringing I reach for the mouse and start clicking on the chessboard after a game starts up.First off, is it bad behavior?Theres the myth primarily in the United States that its of value to be a great multi-tasker. Society thinks youre smarter, more productive, better able to juggle problematic tasks mixed with plain tasks. People say it in their job interviews: I am a great multi-tasker. It brings up images of a great juggler. Someone who wont drop the ball no matter how many you throw at him.A few years ago I was riding in a car with the state senate minority leader of Connecticut. We were on our way to a speech he was going to give. He had the text of the speech up on the steering wheel and while he was driving he kept scratching out lines, making additions, reading from a Marcus Aurelius book to quote from and occasionally asking me if he should slow down the car for a traffic light.Did he get into an accident? No. But he didnt get re-elected for the first time in about ten years. Finally he dropped a ball. Too many were thrown at him.All of these are variations on the classic case of modern day multi-tasking driving a car while talking on the phone. The primal multi-task in the new world order. And guess what? We cant do it. Nobody can. Various studies (this seems euphemistic for bullshit so Ill put link) have shown that cellphone drivers drive at about the same level (measured by accidents) as drunk drivers. People driving over the legal limit of alcohol in their system.I already knew the above fact. Chess has a very statistics-based ranking system. When Im playing chess while talking on the phone, not only am I barely able to focus on the phone conversation but my chess rank goes down by about three standard deviations. In other words, the non-phone version of me can beat the phone version of me 95% of the time. Thats a big jump down. And this is a result of doing just two tasks that Ive done for tens of thousands of hours since I was a kid.Think of all the times in the day you multi-task. Like reading an email while your kids (or lover, even worse) is talking to you. (As an aside, I like the word lover. It implies the full range from Valentines Day commercial sweetness to sex , without being stuck at any one point on that spectrum).Can I get rid of the chess/phone addiction. This is the confessing and Ill stop aspect. It turns out that keeping a secret is bad for our health. A quick example. Take a group of HIV gay people. The ones who are open about their sexuality tend to live longer then the ones who keep it a secret. There are lots of examples where revealing a secret (even by writing it down on a piece of paper and then ripping it up before anyone sees it) has health benefits. Dont believe me? Heres the proof.So now my secret is out. Ill feel better. Ill have better health. Ill live longer. And Ill probably be smarter. Because everyone will now see me as 100% more focused when Im on the phone. And Ill probably be better at chess.But now be honest with yourself. How many times when you are reading a book where you have to go back and re-read the page because you were thinking of something else? This is multi-tasking also. Right now, for instance, Im in the middle of a deal and something happened yesterday that could put the deal in jeopardy. I have no control over it. It was an appraisal on some real estate. So its out of my hands and well just see. I could spend the morning thinking about it. Or I could say, this thought is useless to me and focus on whatever task is in front of me.Most of the time I would multi-task  regret the decision that got me into that deal, worry about the future of the deal, think about the ramifications of the deal, and then try to pay attention to Claudia over breakfast. And heres what the outcomes would be: Absolutely no change on the status of the deal. And of course no change on the past (its done). And nothing in the future would change. I have no control over it. I would be less healthy because of stress. And I would devote less attention to Claudia. Who might then resent it. Which would cause me other future problems. Multi-tasking can ruin your life. Even multi-thinking can ruin your life.Oh, and I just remembered the one time it did ruin a life. I was 18 and driving. I had just had a chess lesson where I had beaten my instructor twice in a row and I was very proud. I was imagining the game in my head. I ran straight thru a stop sign at 60 miles per hour. Hit a station wagon with an old guy in it. Four fences (one for each corner) got destroyed in the result. The older guy broke his leg. And I went through my front window while my dads car got completely wrecked. Multi-tasking.So what should we do?A) Dont multi-task obvious disparate activities: driving and cell phone use. Reading an email and listening to your kids (you will get both activities done faster and more pleasurably if you do one at a time). Texting and walking. Exercise and watching TV (it results in less exercise benefits than just being focused on your body while exercising). Heres a great one: talking to someone else while checking out in a store. The person working in the store probably wouldnt mind you saying a sincere Thank You. Instead, hes thinking, man, this jerk probably never gets off his phone.B) Dont time travel. Regretting the past or worrying about the future is AUTOMATIC bad multi-tasking. It means youre not focused on right now. Your brain is somewhere else and then by definition less productive right now. Its all filled up with no extra space.How to avoid time travel?\\nCatch yourself doing it.\\nRemind yourself these are not useful thoughts\\nBreathe in and feel the air against your nostrils. This puts you immediately in the present.\\nThink of all the sounds you can hear right now. This also puts you in the immediate present. Your brain, which is your time travel machine, is begging you not to do this. It keeps yelling, HEY OVER THERE! IM STUCK IN THE FUTURE! COME GET ME! But its a trap. Dont listen to it.\\nAcknowledge what you should be focused on at this present moment. If you have nothing in front of you maybe just enjoy that you have no tasks right now. Its a great pleasure to be a zero-tasker. I want to be a zero-tasker more and more in my life right now.\\nBut, you might say, I really do have to worry about X and Y! Ok, acknowledge you feel the need RIGHT NOW to worry. That doesnt mean you HAVE to worry. Its just a feeling that you have right now. How does it feel in your body right now. Watch it. Feel it. Let it get bored and disappear.\\nC) Dont keep secrets. A secret is a multi-task. You have to always be reminding yourself, I cant say this while dealing with the people around you. What a burden. Remember: you lose 95% of your abilities when you multi-task. Imagine each secret you keep as another 95% loss of what you can potentially be. Pretty soon you are using none of your potential. And your mind is all the time keeping secrets and time traveling. Youre never here anymore. Youre gone. Bad BRAIN! We hardly ever got a chance to know you.When you sip a coffee, dont read the newspaper. Coffee tastes good and the newspaper always lies and you wont be able to read through the lies. Youll probably miss both those points if you multi-task it. Just taste the coffee. Enjoy it. By the way, Im like Doctor Science today. Holding a warm cup of coffee actually makes you feel happier, makes you more generous, and makes you judge others more favorably. Why would you want to lose those benefits by multi-tasking?Heres the great thing: Everyone around you right now is multi-tasking. Everyone.You just have to look around in the street. Everyone is walking around and talking on their phone or texting while walking. As a culture, weve not only become addicted to multi-tasking, weve put it on a pedestal and started to worship it. How come? So as to excuse our bad behavior and turn it into a hero. The hero of our culture can juggle 20 tasks at the same time and still make a million dollars and have great sex every day.The reality is, if you DONT multi-task then you are the only one. You then become 20 times more productive than the ones who do multi-task. Nobody will be able to compete with you. You will be in a league all by yourself.People ask me: how do you get so much done? Im not bragging because I just admitted that I multi-task in the first paragraph. But Im actively trying not to. And the more I single-task, the more productive I am. Your brain is hypnotizing you into thinking you are a hero when you multi-task. Why does the brain do that? Because he wants more things to do. He doesnt want to be out of a job. He wants you to use him as much as possible. Bad BRAIN!The real hero is the one who knows how to single task. To relieve the burdens of the past and the worries of the future. To shed the secrets that keep churning through the mind. To give up the need for constant multi-stimuli in order to feed the ever-hungrier brain.The true hero is the one who can focus on the single task that is in front of him. And the even more courageous hero is the one who knows how to zero task. I hope I can do that one day. Even for a second. Im going to try today. Maybe while holding a warm cup of coffee.

       "  94: '[They fired me. They fired me as CEO. Then they fired me as a board member. Then they took away my shares. And now none of them ever talk to me.I started the company, I had the initial idea, I raised $30 million for it from A+ investors (i.e. rich people),I bought two companies for it, I hired the first 50 employees, and then I was shown the door.The reason? I was a bad leader. Here are some things I didnt know about my own company: I didnt know what our product did. I didnt know any of the clients. I didnt know how much money we made. I didnt know how much we lost. And I had crushes on the secretaries and maybe two or ten other employees.I wouldve gladly stuck my tongue in the ears of any of those employees. Eewww!But why was I fired?I just didnt do anything for anyone.I never wanted to talk. I would lock myself in my office and people would knock and I would pretend not to be there.If anyone wanted to talk to me about vision I would just nod my head and say something like, make it happen, like I was Captain Picard on the Starship Enterprise.Being a leader doesnt mean you are the guy who runs things.Being a leader doesnt mean you created something or you did something great in the past or some other person has given you any kind of authority.Being a leader happens RIGHT NOW, today, and can be done without money, without authority, and without anybody. First, you have to lead yourself.Its a mindset. Im going to make a list. Forgive me. Feel free to add to the list or add your own experiences in the comments. In fact, I would really appreciate if you can add to this list.After running 20 or so companies (most of them failures). After investing in 30 companies (most of them successes) after advising or being on the board of a dozen companies (most of them successes) and after being married twice (50% success rate), I have a sense of what I think a leader is.I may be wrong but this is my list.A) MORE SUCCESS FOR OTHERS THAN FOR YOUMost important by far: you care about the success of others more than you care about your own success. Everyone around you needs to ultimately become better than you.Thats how you lead. The light is in front of you and you take them to the light and then go back.If all the people around you achieve more than you, then life will be good. You dont have to believe me. Ive seen this happen repeatedly.It doesnt matter if they are employees, investors, friends, spouses. If you just focus on this one principle in all of your actions then you are a leader. Today: figure out how the people around you can have a successful day.Hint: dont stick your tongue in their ear.B) YES, ANDI just wrote a book called The Power of No. Buy it because your life will be better (and I am not ashamed of plugging it).But now Im about to tell you to say yes.Claudia had an idea for a joke this morning that she wants to start a talk off with. I had a suggestion to change it. I didnt say, Dont do that. Do this. I said, Yes, and a technique used in improv comedy.What does it mean? I trust Claudia and value her thoughts so I if I just say no! it shows I havent given enough respect into the time she put into coming up with an idea.So I say Yes, and  and say what is good about her idea and then how I think it can be made even better and why. I give all of her ideas and thoughts respect and add to them rather than ever subtract from them.CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM WORKS LIKE THIS:a. Yes, andb. List whats good c. How you would improve d. Figure out the vision that is the base of the idea that you are talking about. e. Connect the Why of what you are suggesting to the initial vision. Does it work better than the initial idea? f. Be open to the fact that you might be wrong. ALWAYS ALWAYS you might be wrong.C) GRATITUDEI was talking to Lewis Howes yesterday. Hes an athlete turned multi-million dollar webinar and Linkedin expert after living on his sisters couch. He was on my podcast a few months ago.I dont have a voicemail set up on my phone. But Lewis told me his voicemail says, before you leave me a message, tell me one thing you are grateful for.He says the messages people leave blow him away.I always imagine a good leader is surrounded by people who call their mothers at the end of the day and tell them, Mom, you cant believe what I did today. Let me tell you about it.Not that every day is fun. Because some work isnt. But make sure every day your employees can call Lewis Howes and they have at least one new thing they can be grateful for.Maybe they learned a new skill. Maybe they met a new client and created value for that client. Maybe a client they hated was fired because you cant let your employees get the disease that bad clients are all too happy to spread.D) THE 30-150 RULE (ORTHE VISION RULE)Below 30 people, an organization is a tribe. 70,000 years ago, if a tribe got bigger than 30 people theres evidence it would split into two tribes.A tribe is like a family. With a family you learn personally who to trust and who not to trust. You learn to care for their individual problems. You know everything about the people in your tribe.At 30 people, a leader spends time with each person in the tribe and knows how to listen to their issues.From 30-150 people you might not know everyone. But you know OF everyone. You know you can trust Jill because Jack tells you you can trust Jill and you trust Jack.After 150 people you cant keep track of everyone. Its impossible. But this is where humans split off from every other species.We united with each other by telling stories. We told stories of nationalism, religion, sports, money, products, better, great, BEST!If two people believe in the same story they might be thousands of miles apart and total strangers but they still have a sense they can trust each other.A LEADER TELLS A VISIONARY STORY. We are delivering the best service because. We are helping people in unique ways because. We have the best designs because. We treat people better because.A good story, like any story ever told, starts with a problem, goes through the painful process of solving the problem, and has a solution that is better than anything ever seen before.First you listened to people, then you took care of people, but now you unite people under a vision they believe in and trust and bond with.Companies live and die on this. One company I advise got built up by buying 200 regional offices, now they are unifying them under one brand.The key to their success is how powerful the story will be that they tell of that brand. Why are they delivering the greatest value? People need to believe in the story.By the way, this is how humans killed everyone else. Because now we could plan and coordinate in much larger groups than any other species. Thats why there are no other sapiens left on the world. Only homo sapien sapiens (i.e. humans).Proof: within 3000 years of humans first landing in Australia, no species was left that could put up a fight with us. We killed them all.Yay humans!E) CHANGEEveryone has pain they dont want to feel. For instance, I might feel pain if someone makes fun of my looks. I used to feel pain if someone questioned my net worth, which I equated with self worth. If Im CEO I might have pain if the numbers go down.So we do things to hide the pain. We might wear nice clothes not because we like the clothes but because they are buffers for the pain: nobody will make fun of my looks.Imagine all the things we do as buffers for pain. We might avoid going to the store because we dont want to run into the people who cause us pain. We might hide some numbers because we dont want investors to think we are bad CEOs.Soon, everything in our lives we might think give us pleasure (because we are now avoiding all the pain) are actually just buffers against pain and change.When you can get rid of the buffers against pain and change life becomes more insecure, but we become FREE.We live in a bigger world, a world where risk and beauty go hand in hand and we are no longer afraid of the underlying pains.A leader is always prepared for change. And realizes that pain is just opportunities to live in a bigger and more abundant world.This is the secret that most people forget when they build their brick houses and hide inside from the outside world so pain doesnt seek them out.F) DIGNITYThe other day someone cancelled on my podcast at the last minute. I had rescheduled other meetings and even changed the time I would see one of my daughters plays so I could interview this person, a very very successful entrepreneur.She wanted to now reschedule but I said no, even to the detriment of my podcast and all the people who work with me on the podcast who were looking forward to the interview.I wasnt angry with the person. Shes running a business and was probably very busy. And people reschedule all the time. I just didnt like that it was last minute. I had studio time booked and no space to fill it.I have a vision for my podcast. Everyone who comes on are people who have transformed their lives and created the lives they wanted to. I want my listeners to be helped by the transformative stories of my guests.The world is changing very fast and its scary. I want to help people be less scared and I know I am less scared when I hear the stories of my guests and learn from them.Although Im relatively new at podcasting (7 months), I treat my podcast as if its already achieved the dream I have for it. The place where people come on to help others deal with the crazy changes happening in our world and economy.If I dont treat my own projects with respect then how can I expect others to?If I dont treat myself with dignity, then how can I expect the people around me to treat me, or even each other, with dignity?G) THERES ALWAYS A GOOD REASON AND A REAL REASONPeople come to you every day with problems. The problems are usually very good problems. The client is asking for too much. Or Jill didnt do her job right or My car broke down. One time an employee asked to meet me outside the office. She was crying. I asked her what was wrong. She was afraid she was doing a bad job with a client.And she was. But it turned out the real problem was she heard one of my business partners talking poorly about her behind her back and this was affecting her every day at work.This was the real problem that had to be fixed. And it did. And then everything, employee, client, partner, etc went well.In 100% of cases there is a good reason and a real reason.A leader listens to the good reason and comes up with a solution. But then listens even more closely to try and figure out what the real reason is. There is ALWAYS a real reason. Listen for that and see if you can help.A good solution solves one problem. A real solution solves 100 problems.H) HEALTHA sick leader is not a great leader. A leader who is spending time with people not good for them is not a good leader. A leader who doesnt constantly practice creativity is not a good leader. A leader who is not grateful for the abundance already in his or her life will never lead his vision into abundance. He wont know how.Theres no such thing as instant health. Theres only such thing as practice and progress. All you have to do is check the box on progress. Progress compounds every day into enormous Abundance.I) LOVEWarren Buffett says he skips to work and that he would do the work he does for free. Maybe its easy for him to say that because he has 50 billion dollars.But Ive gone through and read his letters from the 1950s when he was first starting out. These letters are not publicly available. I had to really try hard to find them when I wrote the book on them in 2004.But when he was broke and starting his business in his livingroom you can read from his letters that he loved what he did. He took glee in finding companies that nobody else knew about so nobody was looking when they became horribly undervalued and he would then buy those companies.Dont do something just for the money. Money is a side effect of persistence. You persist in things you are interested in. Explore your interests. Then persist. Then enjoy all the side effects.J) LEAD YOURSELFYou dont need to be leading anyone.Before I can lead anyone I have to lead myself. I have to read. I have to try and improve 1% a week. I have a handful of interests and I have a lot of experience.I have to get better at the things Im interested in. I have to understand more deeply the painful experiences Ive had, I have to every day practice the health: physical emotional mental spiritual, that I suggest to everyone else.Sometimes I dont. And I feel it. But thats ok. Dont regret. Today is a new day. Today is the only day.The definition of success for me is: Is today successful?Because who knows if tomorrow will even exist. Today is the only day I need to think about success.And every successful tomorrow is determined by one thing: having a successful today.(Photo from Willy Wonka &amp; The Chocolate Factory)]',\n",
       "  95: '[ I felt so ashamed. I had just lost my apartment in the city. I had no jobs. No prospects for jobs. No money. A few years earlier I had millions and then I had nothing. So I sold my apartment, scraped together some cash, and moved 70 miles north of the city. It was in the middle of a blizzard. I was scared of my neighbors.I couldnt get out of bed I was so depressed. I gained twenty pounds because I never moved my body. There was blizzard after blizzard. I didnt go into the city at all, not even to attend the closing of my hated apartment, which took me almost two years to sell (at almost 50% of the price I originally listed at). I had no phone. Didnt need one. I didnt feel like I would have any skills for a job and it was a recession anyway. I was really scared because my dads career had basically ended in a similar way and then fizzled out from depression. The same thing was going to happen to me, I was sure of it.I got an email the other day. Someone asked me, when you are totally out of luck and feeling incredibly down, how do you spark that creativity up so you can get going again?Were all creative people. Unless were just going to disappear and die, you have to spark it up again at some point. And recession and politics doesnt matter. Were in a $15 trillion economy. Theres $3 trillion in cash lying in the bank. Theres six million private businesses. So once youre creative again theres no reason you cant make money. Lots of it. I dont care what the debt ceiling did today or what imaginary monster downgraded some other imaginary monster. None of that matters for creative people. None of that matters for you and me.Nine Steps to Get More Creative RIGHT NOW1. Turn Upside Down.Not literally. But take any topic people hold dear. Turn it upside down. Pick a topic that people hold so dear its like a religion (See, The 10 Commandments of the American Religion). Education is one of those topics. Start thinking every day of 10 new ways people can get educated. Khan Academy is doing pretty good. Is he the only guy out there who can do something like that? Of course not. Advertising is another area. Publishing is another area. Turn it all upside down.Real estate is another area that can still be turned upside down. Airbnb is only the start. Zillow is only the start. Theres a million ways. Take any topic that is practically a religious topic. Say out loud, the way the world does this right now is bull-shit and start thinking why and how to make it better. Youre not going to solve all the worlds problems right here. This is all to just start off exercising the creativity muscles. You need to start firing those neurons or axons or whatever again. But you never know, sometimes if you exercise enough, you can actually become a professional piano mover.2. List options.In chess, the first thing a grandmaster does when its his turn is not look deeply down one variation but takes a step back and lists all of the possible option moves.Take a pad (my favorite choice: the waiters pad) and start listing options. I still do this all the time. Since its your own private pad your options can be as insane as possible. Who cares? Its your pad!I made a list of options the other day. Even if I dont intend to do any of these its always helpful to list the possibilities for yourself. To list your options:\\nStart a fund (this led to another list of types of funds, types of investors, etc)\\nStart another online business (and then this led to another list)\\nWrite a book about the American Religion (this led to me doing a list of chapters)\\nWrite a novel (working on it today)\\nTry being a standup comedian just once\\nGet more speaking gigs\\nCreate a Dear Abby column on the blog\\nPitch a TV show (blech!)\\nBecome a world famous painter (why not?)\\nAnd so on (these were the least embarrassing so I list them above).And for every option you list, that creates new potential lists of options. When I write pitch a TV show that means I now have to make a list of all the possible options there. The more sub-lists you write, the closer you get to execution.Again, this is not supposed to lead to anything (yet) but just as exercises to kickstart the creativity. This also assumes you are getting the rest of your life together: The Daily Practice plus Avoiding Crappy People.3. Combine Ideas.Lets say there are 10,000 possible things you can be interested in. That means theres over 100,000,000 ways to combine any two ideas to make a new idea. When I first met Claudia (an Argentinian who was obsessed with yoga) I instantly told her, you should create Tango Yoga! Take Tango moves, combine them with Yoga moves, write a book, take photos of beautiful tango dancers doing yoga poses, give classes, do a DVD, etc. Only problem is, shes the only Argentinian on the planet who doesnt know how to tango.But thats just an example. When I started Stockpickr I took my two main interests at the time: making websites, and daytrading, and combined them into one website. BAM!So do it! List all the things youve ever been interested in in your life. See which ones you can combine. Again, were just doing this for fun. No pressures. Im IMing one guy right now as I type this: hes interested in both the bible and being an entrepreneur. How about a book? The 10 Best Entrepreneurs in the Bible! BAM! Is it a good idea? Who knows? But if he does it I bet he can make a living getting speaking gigs about it. And he can self-publish using these techniques and not wait a year for some clueless publisher to figure out how to print up his book.4. New Technology.When the ipad came out, everyone shouldve been listing the multiple businesses that would be created off of that ecosystem. Now that we have Google+ I know several people already brainstorming the various businesses that can be created off of that. And do you think location-based is done? Do you think it was just a fad? We are not even singing the National Anthem on that one yet. Inning number one is still years away. Start thinking man! And show me the idea before you show it to anyone else.Start reading about every new technology you can find. You dont need to be a nuclear rocket scientist to make use of new technologies. Thats what third-world Malaysians are for. Youre the idea guy! The cowboy on the frontier! Theres technology now that can take your brainscan and tell you what letter you were thinking of. When are we going to have the wiki-chip that links Wikipedia to my brain? Chop-chop! Lets do it.5. Connect people.Why is LinkedIn so successful? Because it connects people. LinkedIn is worth billions. You dont need to be worth that much. How about you become a mini-LinkedIn today? Find 5 sets of two people you can connect. Its just like combining ideas only now you are combining people. You dont need any benefit from it. If you can think of two people who can help each other and you put them together then the universe will take care of your benefit. You dont have to spend one ounce of energy thinking about it. Just be creative about who you can put together. Ok, GO!Ive gone to about four dinners in the past few months where the entire purpose of the dinners was to throw people together. Ive gotten insulted, brutalized, made fun of, laughed at by Prime Ministers, ignored by supermodels, scoffed at by presidential candidates, but its been a great experience for someone as anti-social as me. And its strengthened my rolodex of people who I can introduce to each other. Become a connector.6. Make something.I dont know how to paint, sculpt, collage, photograph, nothing. So those areas of my brain are completely dormant and atrophied. It would probably help every area of my creativity, including my business creativity and writing creativity if I just take out the watercolors my kids use and paint something. Or take a bunch of womens fashion magazines and make a collage. It would take my mind off any anxieties I have, and get me focused on some creative time while at the same time I would be riding a steep learning curve.So I asked my kids to give me a lesson on how to draw manga comic book characters. They were great teachers, I got to spend quality time with them, I sparked my creativity in an area I never thought of, and I made stuff (I have to call it that since Im not sure they would approve of me calling it manga).7. Leave.You heard me. Go. Get away. Leave your house. Get in the car and drive a few hours away. Call in sick at work. Go someplace youve never been before. Turn your mind off for a day. Find an obscure museum you can visit. Let me tell you a story. In 2004 I got a letter from the IRS. I got scared. At first I panicked. But then once the situation started to calm down I did the only thing I could do  I left. I went to an ashram sort of place for a long weekend in the middle of nowhere. I didnt speak at all for three days. I ate good. I exercised, meditated, sat at the table where nobody spoke, and kept to myself. By the time I got back I was ready to start my next business and I did and it worked.You cant leave all the time. But one afternoon every two or three weeks take an art day for yourself. Leave and dont look back. Have fun.8. Virtually Leave.Sometimes when Im thinking about what to write about I start checking out websites that I know do a good job curating creativity. Inevitably it will have me start thinking. Here are some of my favorites:\\nBoingboing.net\\nThebrowser.com\\nExtragoodshit.phlap.net (note: not safe for work. This site is run by an 80 year old guy who is an awesome curator of creativity. BUT, he intermixes the great sites with his favorite artistic porn pictures. He can do without those but Im sure they drive traffic.)\\nBrainpickings.org\\nTheres about 1000 others. They get the juices flowing in my brain sometimes. Usually I try to write by reading first and getting that to inspire me. Ill read a writer with a strong autobiographical voice. If that doesnt get me going Ill switch to a spiritual text. If that doesnt get me going, I start hitting the above sites.9. Seek HELP.Sometimes you really are down and out. Sometimes you really cant get out of bed. Sometimes life has beaten down on you or me or whoever a little too much. Thats ok also. You cant just go to a museum and suddenly your brain is on fire with ideas. Every now and then you need a little bit of extra love and attention. Dont ignore the possibility that you might need a doctor to talk, to medicate, to listen, and just work through things while you are going through a tough period.On a regular basis, I do all nine of the above. In my article on The Daily Practice I mention four legs of the practice that I work on every day. The third is the mental leg  i.e. working on the idea muscle. This is the way I work on the idea muscle, by applying all nine of the ideas above.Eventually, in 2002, after my depressive exile from NYC, after all the blizzards, and the silence, and the anxiety of wondering if I was ever going to get off the floor again, I found my creative voice. But it took all of the above. It took the Daily Practice. It took the various posts I mention below. Most of all, it took me getting out of bed and telling myself that I wanted to live again.Im still alive. (Photo by epSos .de)]',\n",
       "  96: '[$70 million was a lot of money for me at the time. And I couldn\\'t sleep at night until I gave back every dollar to the people who gave it to me.I was running the sort of fund where people gave me money and then I invested it in other funds. The only problem was, I couldn\\'t figure out what funds were total scams and what funds were legit. In retrospect, I think about 9 or 10 of the 12 funds I was invested in were total scams.For instance, and this is all in the SEC filings, one fund manager stole $10 million from his fund that I was invested in. He then paid a $50,000 fine when he was caught. Now he\\'s nowhere. I mean, he\\'s somewhere but I can\\'t find him. We\\'re Facebook friends but the last update was him sitting on a beach and it was updated about five years ago.My investors were furious. They had been making money every month with me. They didn\\'t want their money back. When I told them I was going to give them their money back, with profits, they were so upset many of them didn\\'t want me to take a fee.In every business I had ever started, even ones that had totally failed, I had kept good relations with the investors. Except for this one. Not a single relationship survived even though I had made money for everyone.When you can\\'t figure out how you are making money. It\\'s time to change.In 1998 when kids in high school were learning how to make websites, I sold my website design business for $15 million. Two years later almost all website design businesses were out of business.And now in 2006, when no matter how hard I tried to figure it out it seemed like the world economy had gone crazy and I didn\\'t understand how these funds were making money. I pulled out all the money.But I needed something to do or I would quickly go broke. I don\\'t want to act here like I was totally altruistic. I was so miserable all the time. I felt like I had failed and I was also having problems in my marriage. The sort of problems where you\\'d get in an argument and get kicked out of a car in the middle of nowhere.I decided to do the only thing I knew how to do and the only thing that has ever made me money ever.I took one thing I loved and married it to another thing I loved. And, thus, created a new thing. I loved Internet businesses, having built and sold one. And I loved the financial business, despite the fact that it was almost all a scam.  I shut down my fund.Then, each step that follows was critical to success. If I missed one of these steps I would\\'ve failed. Each step was a small step. If you focus on big steps, you\\'ll slip on the small steps.1) I spec-ed out a website I wanted to make: a financial site that had no news on it but was focused on building community by exchanging ideas. I wanted to give people a way to make good decisions on their own.When I say \"spec\", I wrote down what all the buttons on the front page would do and what other content would appear on the front page. I completely defined the next five layers of the site and what buttons and actions and content would occur on each page.2) Once I had the spec, I went to a firm in India and asked them to design five pages of the website. Just the design. No code. This cost me $500.3) I showed a potential distribution partner (thestreet.com) those pages and worked out a deal where they would help me get traffic AND they would place ads in exchange for 50% ownership. They had a billion pageviews a year so I said, \"YES!!\" (Actually, not quite true. I said, I was thinking 3% ownership for them and Tom said, \"No, 50%\" and then I said, \"YES!!\")4) I paid the Indian firm to finish the site. This cost $2000. Then I came up with more ideas for the site and more ideas and more ideas and although we did a soft launch at version 1.0, we did a hard launch at version 5.0 about five months later.5) I got my friends to use the site. First I created over 700 fake users and manually entered in probably over 10,000 pieces of data onto the site just to make it useful right away. Don\\'t be afraid to do things manually to get things going on your site. Even with user-generated content it\\'s ok if you are the first 1000 users if you expect a million users to benefit from it.Every successful business, even Google, Facebook, Twitter, started with a combination of manual improvements and friends of the founders using the site. I got my friends to write reviews of the site on their popular blogs. I wrote articles that would link back to the useful content on the site. I guest blogged on many different websites. This is how you get users back to your site.Everyone asks me, \"how do I get users to my site\". The above is the answer. It\\'s the only answer.Don\\'t forget: when you start a website, it\\'s not yet a trusted site. So you have to bring people from a trusted site to your site to build up the trust in your site.This is true for any site: financial sites, bird-watching sites, weight loss sites, sports sites, whatever. I created three areas of community on the site: a way for people to message and have \"friends\". A user-generated forum system, and a Q&amp;A system. The Q&amp;A system in particular generated 40% of the traffic the day after it launched. I had ads on every page at this point. A million users a month. And no employees. So we were profitable. We were making about $100,000 a month with zero employees in just four months. Being too afraid to build this into a big business, I sold the site almost instantly.I could\\'ve used other examples. I could\\'ve used the debit card business I started. The delivery service I started. The mental health hospital I was involved in. The billion revenues business I\\'m on the board of directors of and the many other businesses I\\'ve advised and consulted with and invested in.But the lessons are all the same.LESSONS LEARNED GET DOWN ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES AND SCRUB. Even when something is scalable, don\\'t be afraid to get down on your hands and knees and be the first part of that scaling. Don\\'t expect anonymous users to do all your initial hard work. Don\\'t expect computers to do all your initial hard work.YOU do all your initial hard work. FREE CONTENT ON THE FRONT PAGE. I had so much free content available it obscured the design. Everyone cares too much about design. Value is 10x more important than design. OUTSOURCE IN INCREMENTAL STAGES. First we designed pages, then after we knew we were going to get big distribution, we made the rest of the site. Then, based on user feedback and more ideas, we designed four more versions before an official launch. The site changed drastically from version 1.0 to version 5.0. DIVERSIFY YOUR DISTRIBUTION. Although there was one primary source of distribution (thestreet.com) where I was getting traffic from, I also worked out deals to get traffic from AOL. Yahoo, Forbes, Reuters, and basic advertising. HERE\\'S HOW TO NOT WORRY ABOUT COMPETITION. I had competition but they were doing the \"build it and they will come\" technique. 95% of businesses forget that it\\'s important to be the first heavy users of your product.A restaurant is a great example of this. The initial success of a pizza restaurant doesn\\'t depend just on how good the pizza is, but how many of your friends and their friends come in the door to buy it. Don\\'t be afraid to call everyone in your rolodex to come on over and try the pizza.Actually, this is not quite true either. When I first realized I had competition, I cried. I actually called the developers in India and told them it was all over. They had to cheer me up. One thing I learned ultimately, was that the biggest asset the business had was the passion my partner and I had for it. That passion was much higher than the passion of our competitors so we ended up creating and implementing the best ideas. End of competition. I DIDN\\'T KNOW ANYONE. I cold-called Yahoo, AOL, and Forbes to get on their radar.In fact, I had a \"negative network\". The first guy I called at Yahoo said he knew me. \"Oh yeah?\" I said because I had no idea who he was.He said, \"yeah, I invested in your wireless Internet business and lost my investment.\"You would think that would have hurt my chances. Yahoo became one of my biggest sources of distribution after that call. That guy became my biggest advocate within Yahoo.The key is to anticipate what they might want, show them how it will cost them nothing but they will get huge benefit from it, and then just simply do it. Make it as easy as possible for the other side to say \"yes\" before you ask them.If you want someone to say \"yes\", show them exactly what \"yes\" looks like and show them that it is already made. COMBINE INTERESTS. I had been 20 years already in the technology business (since I was in college). And I had been in the financial industry for about seven years then. So I combined interests and made the best financial website. Nobody else was as well-placed in this intersection as I was. MAKE THE BUSINESS YOU WOULD USE. I wanted a site with no news, but tons of interesting ideas, perspectives, ideas, and community.Investing based on news is the fastest way to poverty but it is very common in the hedge fund business for professional investors to call each other and exchange ideas. Hedge fund managers are on the phone all day with each other.I made it very simple for everyone, and not just hedge fund managers, to do that online. ABD. Always be dealmaking. Even though I had a 50% distribution partner right from the beginning I was constantly meeting with companies and people to see what extra deals I could make.I would come up with ideas about the value I could deliver them and then I would offer up that value. Maybe they needed a white label version of my site. Maybe they needed content from my site. Maybe they needed their blog to be distributed on my site, maybe they wanted their newsletter sold on my site.I did any deal I could do. Until finally I sold the site. But that wasn\\'t even the final deal. I stuck with it and the site continued to grow. NOTHING IS A STRAIGHT LINE. There were constant cases where the code was bad on the site and the site would crash if it had too many users at the same time. Every other week I thought I was going to have a heart attack because the site kept crashing.And some companies were very slow to do deals with me. Some companies outright rejected me (Google). You can\\'t be bitter or burn bridges. There may come another day, another company, or all the people at Google might move to other places where you do business with. The key here is to always stay in touch and provide monthly updates showing how you are improving things. Always be willing to help people no matter what. HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN TO GIVE UP?Every step of the way I was willing to give up if I didn\\'t see some form of traction. Sometimes that meant more users. Sometimes that meant more profits. Sometimes that meant more technology that I really liked and ideas implemented that people wrote great reviews about. BUILD COMMUNITY BY HAND. I traveled around the country holding meetups with the most active users so I could see with my own eyes how the site was helping people. It was exciting to me. As long as I had that excitement, I knew something was working.The people who showed up at those meetups became almost like ambassadors for the site. They were so active they used the site more than me. Nothing beats face to face meeting to build your ambassadors.Why did I go myself to most of these meetups?There\\'s a saying in Argentina, \"When the CEO is looking, the cow grows fatter\". A business builds fastest when the CEO is looking at it. There\\'s a thousand details that the CEO sees. There\\'s 100 details that the COO sees. There\\'s 10 details that the regular employee sees. And details slip through the cracks when there is nobody.At the same time I had also started a dating site (or four) and none of them got traction even though the sites were beautiful and I had smoked my own crack and thought the businesses were great. But no users equals no traction.Perseverance is like a fire that needs oxygen.Love is the oxygen for perseverance. You can love it. Users can love it. Partners can love it. Investors can love it. There are a lot of sources of love. Businesses and humans need love to live.Ultimately, you create value for people and that\\'s how you build the love.Business is just the delivery mechanism of that love.Then love + perseverance = abundance.I sold that business for $10 million and then two years later I was dead broke because once again I forgot all about love. I squandered the love.So I had to start from scratch again. Which I did.(Photo by Purple Slog)--- Thanks to everyone who has listened to 100 episodes of my podcast.

       "  97: \"[            Keep your eyes shut. Hes disgusting, the woman told her daughter.About me.We were in Burger King and my mom and I were at the next table. I was ten years old. I was eating a Whopper when I heard the girls mother. I got embarrassed.I had about half the whopper in my mouth but it wouldn't fit. I tried to make it all fit in. I had another whopper waiting for me and I loved eating fast. There was food dripping down from my mouth.It wont be so bad if you dont look at him, the mother said. But mom the daughter said.I wanted to keep chewing but then I had that feeling that I didnt want to swallow any more. Everything would go wrong. I was a deer in headlights. I turned red.Maybe the cashier at Burger King would stab me with a spork to stop the agony. Maybe she would laugh a maniacal laugh while doing it. Her laughter would sound like an old lady falling down a flight of stairs. Everyone would clap, including my mother. Maybe the mayor would give her an award.Maybe I would be expected to show up at the award ceremony and give her the trophy. And pin a medal on her. Everyone would shout, dont look at him.When my children hear this story they laugh. Daddy was disgusting! Thank GOD they have a father they can learn these valuable lessons from. Tell us more!I have an addiction to speed. Not the drug. The movement. I chew fast. I make money fast. I lose money faster. I fall in love fast. I get my heart broken faster. I get addicted fast.Im addicted to you. The reader of this post. And Ive fallen in love with you. Maybe too fast. We hardly know each other.When I start a book I want to finish it the next day. When I start a company I want to sell it yesterday. Most of these things turn out to be failures.Maybe. I dont know.When I run fast its because Im running towards a goal. Fuck goals.But then people say, its the journey that counts.Really? Which part of the journey? Going through security? Waiting. Taking your belt off. Having the woman at TSA slap you in the face as hard as she can with your belt while laughing?Wait. That didnt happen.Heres things I now always try to do slower.Eating  Theres one basic statistic. On average, it takes people fifteen minutes to realize their small intestine is full. In other words, you keep eating even after youre full. Then you say, ugh, Im so full. How could I have eaten so much. No problem. If you eat slower you avoid this problem.There are side benefits. You can enjoy the food more. By noticing the flavors. We live in a fast food economy. We eat while on the run. On the way to work. On the way to there from here. So we need quick flavors. A rush of MSG and sugar that light our tongue on fire. I have a feeling if I eat slower then I will enjoy it better. I have no evidence of this. Im still the little boy whose mother covers her daughters eyes. It will be ok if you just dont look at him.Wake up - If you get up too fast theres evidence your stress levels skyrocket. So this is what I do every morning when I wake up: I stretch in bed. I think of ten people Im grateful for. I smile. If Claudia is still in bed, I touch her head. I try to pry open her eyes. I check her pulse. If shes not in bed she better have coffee waiting for me. It takes me 20 minutes to get out of bed after I wake up.Opinions - Opinions seem largely genetic. If our parents have an opinion then we end up inheriting it (go to college! get a job! do something with your life!) or sometimes we have the opposite opinion BECAUSE our parents had an opinion. Either way.Or we look at someone and get an opinion (Boy, I really hate that person is a thought I think when I see someone playing a guitar in a music store).Or, That person just did something bad to me! Thats a favorite opinion.Sometimes its good to not have any opinions. Or to at least slow down having one.Try replacing the exclamation mark with a question mark. That person did something bad to me? That forces you to look at the opinion from different sides. Or better yet, put a semicolon between every word in the opinion. This seems like the only good use of a semicolon. It slows everything down.Im ; upset ; about ; something ; but ; it ; no ; longer ; seems ; important ?Read  Theres some works of fiction Ive read over 100 times. I love them. When you love a work of art and you take it in slow you notice something new every time. If you skim so you can reach the end then all you notice are the words. None of the art. Youre unable to lick the flavor off the page.Spend money  From 1999-2000 I bought a $2mm house and renovated it. I invested $2mm in a company that made Blackberries for deaf people and lost it all. And then I lost a million a week until I went dead broke. I lost my house. Lost friends. Lost self-respect. People who had previously spit on my face now wouldnt even return my phone calls. I had $0 in the ATM.I wanted to hire someone to kill me so my kids could collect insurance. I wanted to go into a hotel room and have sex with 1000 prostitutes and smoke crack until I exploded. But I just crawled on the floor into the fetal position until I figured out how to uncurl.I wish I had spent money slower. Like a lot sllooooowwweerrrr. I had ten years of agony bouncing around on that roller coaster until I was divorced, broke, friendless, familyless and I blame myself for at least two deaths until I started to make a comeback. Fuck.Start a business  I went to a BODA meeting once (business owners debtors anonymous). I thought it would help me to make all of my money back very fast. Instead everyone was talking about how they were learning to be just fine. I was convinced they were all drug addicts and this was the drugs speaking.But business is just a vehicle for transforming the ideas in your head into something real, something tangible, that actually improves the lives of others. To create something unique and beautiful and valuable is very hard. Its very special to do. It doesnt happen fast.It happens when you read everything, write everything, do everything, fail a few times, network hard, get customer reactions, tweak the product, rebuild, sell, add more services, add to your product, make friends, increase the love among your customers.That takes a long time. Sloooowwwww.Open your mouth  My mouth is the cause of most of my troubles. Kissing the wrong people. Eating the wrong foods. Talking bad about people.Our cells change every seven years. Where do the new cells come from? Mostly from the food we eat. Cancer, Alzheimers, Heart attacks, Strokes, all come from the food we eat. Shut your fucking mouth sometimes.Listen.Ive written about gossip before. But reading it, thinking it, saying it, writing it, does nothing for you. Neither you nor the person you gossip about will have your name on a building in a 100 years. Charlie Brown never gossiped. Luke Skywalker didnt. Mr. Spock didnt. What makes you better than them?Before opening your disgusting, chapped, bacteria-filled, gum-diseased mouth that rarely has anything to say, think about just keeping it shut. Ugly words are like drunk vomit.Think  I can think of the five worst moments in my life. I can think of the five best moments in my life. In the five worst moments in my life I was thinking 100 thoughts simultaneously. Will I lose X? /What if I do this? /Why did he say that? /Why wont they call? /What if I go broke? /What? Why? How When? Add it up. Over and over. Faster pussycat, kill, kill.In my best moments of my life I had maybe, single thoughts. Like, Shes beautiful. Or look at that sunset. Sometimes I didnt even think of those. Sometimes I just thought of nothing. Nice pussycat.Breathe  Think of when you are stressed or in pain. Your breathing becomes very fast and shallow. Just do the opposite of that and you will never be stressed.Claudia tells me that yogis measure their lifespans in breaths rather than years so they live long lives. I dont know. Is that true?But then she uses the turtle as an example. Some turtles have lived over 200 years. That means there could be a turtle now that actually watched Thomas Jefferson have sex with Sally Hemmings. A turtle breath can last for an hour. My breath lasts about three seconds. I should really slow that down.???  What else can be slower to improve enjoyment in life (other than the obvious answer).Some people want a lot of money. Some people want enlightenment. Some people want the girl or guy of their dreams. And some people want to find passion in life and have it be fulfilled. All of this stuff that is there. Its not bad to want these things. Its good. But you cant get them there until you first find them here. Abundance is here. But we often ignore it or dont see it.Sometimes I feel like Im still the boy with the Whopper dripping down my face. That was great.That boy never had any worries. He believed Superman was a god. He loved the leather smell in the back seat of the car. He shoplifted. He wanted to be an astronaut and a President and a spy and the piano player at a sleazy lounge. All at the same time. He would wear a tuxedo and his hair would be straight and hed be charming with women.And ever since hes been winning awards for being disgusting. If he could unwind it he would do it all again. But slower so he would enjoy it.]\",\n",
       "  98: \"[       Everyone around the dinner table had been brutally rejected hundreds of times. I was at a dinner with a bunch of people who had gone the self-publishing route via Amazon. All of them except for me were fiction writers and all had sold over 100,000 copies or more of their various novels. The guy sitting across from me had just sold the movie rights to his latest science fiction series. Another woman was working on the sequel to her young adult paranormal series. Another guy had sold over 500,000 copies of his various thrillers. The guy sitting next to me had been very successful at his children's chapter books series, Sweet Farts.All of them had one thing in common. While pursuing the career of their dreams they had all been rejected. Some of them 100s of times. All of them were either on the verge of writing fulltime for a living or had already made the leap. Every one of them was smiling.How many wouldve been smiling if they had given up after the 39th rejection and didnt go for that 40th. Or didnt go for that moment when they decided: Im going to take control of the creative process and not stop where the gate keepers tell me to stop.So many times Ive been stopped by the gatekeepers. At a job, for instance, where my boss said, stop working on this and focus on your main job. Or when I was trying to sell a TV show and there were only one or two decision makers and they all blocked my path for political reasons. Or I wanted to sell a company and there were only a few decision makers who could make or break what I thought then was my entire life. The stark fear I had whenever I spoke to them, knowing they had this enormous power over me and thinking, foolishly, that I had nothing to offer them.Every day, in all aspects of our lives, we are rejected. Rejection is probably the most powerful force in our lives. Think back about the times youve been rejected and how your response to it changed your life completely. There are three basic responses to rejection that Ive seen (in just the past few days Ive seen examples of all of these).I suck. I cant do this. I give up.They are stupid. Im going to keep pushing forward.Hmmmn, what can I do differently. What can I learn from this rejection?Obviously Im going to ignore the first two. It could be the case that you need to give up. Or it could be the case that you should do nothing to improve and you just push forward, but that should never be the gut response (although, again, Ive seen it as the gut response several times from various people in just the past few days/months/years/myself/etc).So how can you take rejection and use it to push forward.A) Improve what you are selling/making/offering/doing.You wanted that ONE job, that ONE scholarship, that TV show, that book, to sell your company, to sell your product, whatever. And they said, no. Take a hard look at the product. Can you improve your offering. Can you take a step back and improve what you are doing? Maybe you can and maybe you cant. But brainstorm first. What are the ten things you can do to improve what you are doing.One time I tried to sell a company I had started. The company didnt have enough clients and enough revenues. And I was a bit inconsistent about the services we were offering that made us unique. There were about 10 different areas I needed to improve and gradually I improved them all and sold the company a year later.Another time I wanted a job. But I didnt know enough about what I was doing. I had to improve my education, take courses, study books, study the history of what I was doing, etc.B) Expand the Universe of decision makers. Until the past two or three years, if you wanted to sell a novel there were basically 5-10 decision makers. So about 20,000 people would submit novels to these decision makers (the major publishing houses) and most would get rejected. Who would reject you? Interns and assistants who had just graduated college with a degree in comparative literature who barely even looked at what you wrote.Now you can self-publish via Amazon and its a great process. I explain why and how here. You just chose yourself but, more importantly, the readers become your decision makers. The universe of millions of readers will now help you make your next decisions on how to improve, how to gain more power over your creative process, and finally, how to secure power over your entire life.This is the CHOOSE YOURSELF ERA. When I was visiting with Amazon I was amazed at what a revolution this is. Its not about an extra device. Its about how for the first time since Gutenberg theres an actual revolution in how you can communicate with the masses. In every way you can choose yourself now to succeed, to improve, to communicate, to extend your reach to the individuals who need your message. Dont give up on this opportunity. In fact, rejection might be what forces you into it, as it did for the 20 or so authors I met.And its not just novels. Its everything. Can you widen the audience for your product? Online dating has expanded the decision makers in your relationship life. And YouTube has greatly expanded the universe of tastemakers who will define your fate. I hate to say it, but Justin Bieber uploading YouTube videos of himself greatly increased his chances of success instead of trying to go the same route as everyone else  up through the traditional 5-10 record labels deciding your fate. All respect to the kid who chose himself and made it work.C) Improve your approach. You keep getting rejected in bars? Find a different place where the odds arent stacked against you. Nobody is responding to your networking emails for 10 minutes of your time please? Then offer something. Give something for free so people see value in your approach immediately. You keep cold-calling customers and they hang up? Find a different way to get distribution.D) Change Up, Dont Give Up. I was the guy who gave up on the 39th try when trying to sell a novel I had written. Sometimes the odds are just too stacked against you. Maybe it would have worked on the 40th try. I dont know. But Im glad I gave up. I changed up instead. Instead of focusing on fiction as the only creative medium I started looking at both TV and the brand new world wide web as creative media. Which led to a job at HBO. Which led to my first company focusing on building content-heavy websites for entertainment companies.I didnt give up on being creative. I expanded the power of my creativity by not limiting myself to one domain, vowing to return to book-writing later, vowing to return ultimately to fiction-writing. Maybe Ill do it, maybe I wont. But the Change Up certainly released me creatively and I was able to use it to build both my financial life and creative life. Well see if it ever comes full circle.E) Improve your authenticity.Social media can also be called Individual media as opposed to Group Media. Instead of a large group broadcasting your effort, you can build up your own presence by establishing your Facebook platform, your twitter presence, your linkedin, quora, pinterest, blogging, amazon, slideshare, scribd, reddit, etc presence. All of these channels are used to create authenticity for your offering. Each follower, fan, etc you are personally able to sway over to your side of the world continues to establish your authenticity regardless of who is rejecting you. This is how you choose yourself and build your own platform rather than relying on the whims of a meager few.F) Ask for advice.Someone rejected you? Poor baby! Now, after your mourning is over, ask why? Youre going to be rejected all your life. In every way. It never hurts to understand why. Sometimes they will even tell you and, in those cases, its a guarantee that you will remember.G) Dance with failure.You just got rejected? How did you deal with it? Did you cry? Did you give up? Did you think to yourself, why do I ALWAYS fail? Did you think to yourself, those guys are STUPID for rejecting me. Understand your reaction to failure. What can you do to improve it.The other day I read that 76% of the universe is comprise of dark energy. IN other words, we have zero clue as to what it is. And another 20% is dark matter, i.e. matter that we have zero clue what it is. And only 4% of the universe is actually made up of matter we understand. In other words, after Newton, Einstein, Heisenberg, and 2000 years of collective exploration of what the universe is made up of, weve basically failed. In fact, the more knowledge we got, the more we realized how badly we were failing. We used to think we had it down. But now even the Big Bang theory is in serious question. We just suck at understanding the world around us.Do physicists cry themselves to sleep every night because they have failed so bad? Of course not. This failure has only given them opportunity to discover more. Its opened up vast landscapes of potential understanding that can actually help us understand what the universe is, and in that understanding, help us understand who we are.Not every failure is an opportunity. But figure it out. Look at the times you failed. How many, in retrospect, were opportunities. About two years ago I had a billionaire that wanted to give me about $50 million to start a fund. A mutual friend of ours blocked it for some reason I still dont know. At the time I was upset.Now Im grateful. Ive done so many things since then that Im very happy I did and I never wouldve done if I was busy running a fund. Thank god I got rejected! I never wouldve done this blog, for instance.H) Acknowledgement of the Process.The NORMAL thing is to be rejected. To get rejected by jobs, your kids, friends, family members, relationships, businesses, publishers, everyone. As Dashama put it in her recent email to me: a third will like you, a third will hate you, a third wont care.no matter what you do.Its actually ABNORMAL to get close to not being rejected. Its even more abnormal to be accepted or to succeed in some conventional sense. So acknowledge that its perfectly normal to feel rejected over something. And its perfectly normal to fear it for the future. In fact, to do otherwise would be to reject reality.But also acknowledge the successes. The things that occur that are abnormal. The things you do to improve. The things you learn on the road to choosing yourself.Dont fall back into a story (I always get rejected) that is more fairy tale than reality.I) Stay in touch.Its hard for me to not to burn bridges. I tend to do it too much. But Ive found great success when Ive not fallen into the burning bridge pattern I often succumb to.Example: I once tried to sell an early company I started to Omnicom, thebig ad agency. I met with the woman who made these decisions for Omnicom. She felt we werent ready yet.Every month I sent her an update: new clients, new sales numbers, number of employees. I also offered to help any of the agencies that Omnicom had. One time I called her on behalf of one of my clients to see if she could recommend any agencies within the Omnicom family to help one of my clients. In other words, I offered her real value.After about a year of me doing this every month she rallied about three of the agencies within Omnicom to come over and check out my company. All three made offers. Did I accept any? No, but I was able to leverage those offers into a better offer from someone who came completely out of the blue.I hate the phrase life is too short. Sometimes it feels very long to me. But its certainly too short to spend any time on hard feelings. Everyone is just trying to get by. Both the rejected and the rejecters. Nobody is free from this. So lets all keep in touch to make it a tiny bit easier to make it to the finish line.J) What am I missing in this?Im certainly missing a lot only because weve all been rejected in different ways. Whats your favorite technique to get through it and move on?(Photo by Steve Snodgrass)]\",\n",
       "  99: '[A lot of angry people out there are trying to control you and even kill you.I bet you can list at least a dozen people trying to control you right now.I wrote an article on my email list saying how I paid up on my taxes for the first time ever but that it made me sick to my stomach. Blech!Taxes and money are a very emotional issue for many people. Some people wrote me angry letters. In two cases I wrote back, Please reread the article and then they reread and apologized.How come they apologized? Because they didnt read it. They just projected their own anger onto my article and then onto me. Thats what most people do all of the time. They are sick but they puke on you.They wanted to provoke a response from me. They wanted to control me.I have two challenges: not letting people control me, and not trying to control anyone else. When I succeed at these two things, life is pretty good.The first time I ever made a lot of money, it did not make me free. It cost me my freedom. Before I had money I had a lot of friends, I did what I wanted on weekends and at nights, I had fun.After I had money I started thinking I needed to make more money. A LOT more money. I started buying things I couldnt really afford. I felt people wouldnt like me if I didnt have these things.I started lending money out to friends and family in the hopes of helping them. I thought people would like me if I saved them.NOBODY will ever remember how you helped them. And you cant save anyone. This was my first lesson.My second lesson is that I never really owned anything. When I owned a house I became slave to the bank, slave to the government, slave to upkeep of the house, slave to the other people living in the house (my family, who I became afraid would be homeless).Third, I let money control who I associated with. Eventually I ended up with no friends or family. The people I truly loved at the time, I lost. I still regret it.I was afraid of consequences. I was afraid to lose everything even though I had already lost it.I sold everything. I had to give up many of my friendships and even many of my family relationships. I disappointed probably everyone. But it was the only way I could get free and start from scratch.Once I started from scratch I was able to begin the long process of reinventing myself.I probably own nothing right now except some clothes and some books. And all my relationships, 100% of the people I talk with, are only with people I choose to talk to.If someone in my life tries to control me because of their own fears and angers, then they are out.I also try to not control anyone else. If someone does something I dont like, I cant control what they think or do.Its useless and its a waste of my time. I try to change my circumstances so I dont have to deal with those people.What if you are stuck in a job and have bills to pay because of past mistakes? You have to work for your freedom then. And its an ongoing process. Its every day.The key to freedom is Luck. But luck is not magic.Luck equals 1. Persistence plus 2. Diversification.\\nDiversification means coming up with 1000 ideas and implementing the one or two percent that seem reasonable.\\nPersistence is a sentence filled with failures punctuated by the occasional success.\\nComing up with 1000s of ideas means having the energy and creativity to brainstorm.Energy equals Physical plus Emotional plus Mental plus Spiritual health.All forms of health are a function of how much you control your own life divided by how much people control you.When I respond to an angry comment, someone controls me. Anger controls me. Then I spend less time being healthy.If Im in an unhappy relationship but afraid of the consequences of breaking it then fear controls me.If I daydream arguments between myself and a boss or a sister or a colleague or whoever, then anger is controlling me. Their issues have nothing to do with me.If I let them control me, or I try to control them, then I sacrifice my health. Then I cant generate ideas. I lose persistence. I get unlucky. I lose my freedom.Every time. No exceptions. Id rather be healthy than right.Many people have written about things like the law of attraction. The law of attraction is about attracting things in the outside world into your life.This is fine. But it wont work unless you control whats happening on the inside world first.This is the one thing truly under your control. Its the only way to choose yourself.Dont be the slave. Be the master.Photo by Siarhei Tolak / shutterstock]',\n",
       "  100: '[ Dont be so disappointed in yourself. It didnt work out. Lots of things dont.1st Grade  I ONLY wanted to be a member of the Legion of Super Heroes, a team of 30th century teenage comic book heroes all from different planets. I felt bad for them. Often they felt lonely because they were all from different planets and even looked funny but they stuck together as a team of friends and some of them (Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad) even got married. It wouldnt be so bad to be part of their team. I was only six so I figured there must be some way I could apply myself and be a part of their team. (Saturn Girl, I would save her) 2nd Grade and 3rd Grade  No question about it: an astronaut. Like Major Nelson from I Dream of Jeannie. Not only could you go into space but you could also have Barbara Eden as an obsessive wife. This was more like Jamess Dream than I Dream of Jeannie. I occasionally also wanted to be an aquanaut, figuring it might be as good as being an astronaut and I had all of Jacques Cousteaus books.4th Grade  Senator. I wanted to be just like Sam Ervin, the Senator from North Carolina who prosecuted Nixon. I read everything I could about Watergate. I asked my dad, what if I wrote Nixon (he was retired in NJ) and asked him if he could tell me, a 4th grader, the truth about what happened. My dad, Dont be stupid. I wondered if being a Senator might be a stepping stone forbigger things.5th Grade  A gossip columnist. Or Dear Abby. I was reading enough Judy Blume and Harriet the Spy. I thought that gave me enough insight to recognize all the gossip in my grade and also give advice on it. I kept a notebook of who liked who and everyone wanted to see it. The teacher banned me from bringing it into school because it was causing too much fuss. But to this day I still stand by that David Pakenham liked Joanne Arico. I could recite all the pages in Forever where there were sex scenes. (Everything I knew about life I learned from Judy Blume) 6th Grade  I had it all planned out: 18 years old Id be a juror, Then by 25, Congressman. 30, Senator or Governor. 35. Vice-President. 40. President. Easy. I started pretending to be a reporter so I could call up Senators and Congressmen all day long to interview them. Maybe build up allies for eventual campaign. I would have to pretend to be sick so I could say home and get all these people during office hours. My parents even let me visit DC to visit the White House. The Presidency was going to be A LOCK for me.7th Grade  Professional breakdancer. The vanilla popper. DONT LAUGH! Dont tell me I dont have the moves til you see me in action. I could pop, lock, moonwalk (or whatever planet you want me to walk on), spin on back, I had the linoleum, the Puma slick jacket, the Puma shoes (the kind with the hard toes so easier to moonwalk), etc. DONT EVEN LAUGH AT THIS.8th Grade  Master of the Occult. Doctor Strange. Potential Satanist. Then Buddhist. Then member of various cults that I was going to rise up through and lead. This continued through 9th grade.10th Grade  Girls, girls, girls. More girls. I liked every girl. I would steal porn magazines from the pharmacy. What about the one with the letter where the girl sneaks up on the guy who fell asleep drunk at the party and he wakes up and shes having her way with him. Does stuff like that happen, I wondered? Could it happen to me? I couldnt wait to be an adult. Because it wasnt happening to me in 10th grade. I called Steve Giacalona: do you think any girl would like me? And he was honest, no but maybe when your acne clears, you get rid of your glasses, your braces go away, you dress better, and you do something about your hair. That gave me some hope. He had a girlfriend who even wanted to have sex with him when he had a broken leg.11th Grade  Professional chessplayer. It was already too late for me. I shouldve started when I was six years old. I started playing in December of 11th grade. I was the 4th slot on my team because Alan Bergman couldnt make it. I had no idea what to do. On the way to the match with Matewan I got a book by Fred Reinfeld which recommended The Stonewall opening. I still remember the moves right from the book. David Bender said on the way, Why are chessplayers always so ugly because we we were looking at the cover of Chess Life Magazine which had Tony Miles (RIP) on the cover. I won my game.12th Grade  Still professional chessplayer. I knew I could do it. If I won every game I ever played. I became NJ Junior champ. I was ready. But, alas:(Tony Miles, professional chessplayer. Ugly?) College  Girls. Chessplaying ended. I met one girl who I instantly fell in love with. I said to my friend, Jude, if she only knew I would be her willing slave. I would do everything for her. Jude said, she would get bored of you instantly. Thanks Jude. Hey Jude.College, Sophomore Year  Entrepreneur. I started a company, College Card, with two other people including Wende Biggs, daughter of Barton Biggs. We offered a debit card to college students plus we delivered, among other things, pizza from one place and gyros from another. Anyone using our card got free delivery. Plus anyone using our card got discounts. I had 5% of the company. Easily worth $10 million in my mind. I had no clue. We were out of business within six months. Wende left for business school. Our other partner, Rick, left for Mastercard. And another partner, Jeff, became a tennis pro. But I was an entrepreneur.College Senior Year (skipped Junior year to avoid getting into more debt. Who the hell wants to go to college for four years and spend all that money): Computers computers computers. Its all I thought about. On the weekends there was a combination lock to the CS department. I went in it. Then a combination lock to get down the research hallway. Then a combination lock to get to the library where all the research reports were. Id settle down with a bag of chips and read every research report, safely knowing that my girlfriend of two years at the time had no way of finding me or reaching me. Heaven.Graduate School  shouldve been computers. Thats what they were paying me to go to graduate school for (They being indirectly the Department of Defense). But now I wanted to be a professional Go player. I spent 10 hours a day playing Go. Then I spent ten hours a day writing novels. [See, \"I\\'m Guilty of Torturing Women\"] All I did was write fiction. Day and night. I got thrown out of grad school because of this and in every job I had in Pittsburgh I would work as little as possible so I could write ten pages a day (3000 words). I wrote 4 or 5 novels, dozens of short stories. I sent them out to publishers, magazines, agents, and got rejected 100% of the time. So I figured I needed connections and I moved toNYC  HBO. I was working in the IT department but secretly wanted a TV show. Documented all that here.I am such a loser. NOTHING I ever wanted to be worked out for me. Ive switched careers 12 times since I graduated college. And since my time at HBO Ive switched careers another 9 times (website developer, wireless software guy, venture capitalist, daytrader, trader for hedge funds, started a fund of hedge funds, writer for financial media, public speaker, online dating service creator, and Im sure there are a few that were borderline legal that Ill leave off of this list.)Now, Im none of these things.Now, I want to be Dear Abby again. Back to my 5th grade dream. Oh, and I want to write novels again. Back to my graduate school (in Computer Science) dream.Who knows what it will be 10 years from now, or even 10 days from now? It changes a lot. What I want to do for the rest of my life is always going to change. Sometimes I wonder, am I too much of a dilettante? Why cant something work out and I just stick with it? Like how it did with Larry Page Some days I have no idea what I want to do and I spend the day wondering, what should I do? But I dont sweat it.And whatever it is I want to do today, Im just going to go ahead and do it.  In the comments, please post what you wanted to do that didnt work out. It feels cathartic to do it.

       "  101: '[One time I wanted to sell my company to HBO. The CFO was looking at the numbers. They were willing to buy it for a tiny amount but it was an amount that wouldve taken me about one billion years to save because thats just the way I roll. I figured I would quit after a decent amount of time and spend a year doing nothing but writing a novel.They said no.All I had been thinking about for months was whether or not they would buy the company. And it took only one or two decision makers to say no. To ruin my life, I thought then.---One time I had an idea for a TV show for HBO. I wired up a restaurant with video and audio. A good friend of mine who was very pretty and funny put an ad in the Village Voice looking for a blind date. She would then go on the dates being fully aware they were being videotaped but the guy wouldnt know. We did two dates. On the first one the guy told her he wasnt sure if he was gay or straight and was debating the pros and cons of both right in the middle of the date. On the second date the guy received a phone call. From his wife. He then refused to sign the release form unless my friend would sleep with him. Which she didnt (I assume).As they say, it was good TV.I showed it to HBO Independent Productions. They Loved it!! I had all sorts of fantasies about how I was going to spend the money. I was definitely living in the future. I was going to be a big TV guy. BIG.And then suddenly I couldnt get in touch with them. The guy in charge, Dave B., wouldnt return my calls. He was always in a meeting. He would call me right back. I couldnt get in touch with him. Not knowing this meant no, I called him 15 times a day until finally he confessed, you know, you have another project going with [he named another division within HBO] so they got upset at me for looking at this project. So I cant touch it.I eventually had lunch with the head of the other division. She said, your idea seems a bit mean to me. Her division had just aired Hookers at Hunts Point and other family-oriented features so I sort of understood.---Another time I started another company. I wanted Google to buy it. I mean, I really wanted Google to buy it. Google was like some sort of Internet Disneyworld to me. People were riding around in skateboards (technically I signed a contract saying I couldnt say what I saw in the building. They accidentally had me sign the wrong document so I actually had to GO BACK a day later and sign the right one. But, fuck it, everyone was skateboarding in there while eating fusion lasagna). Everyone was smiling. Everyone was SMART. We all sat around this big conference table and when I say we all sat around half of us were in NYC and the other half was web-exed or whatever in from SF. Everyone asked smart questions. I felt like I was in graduate school again.That night I woke up in the middle of the night sweating. I literally felt like I wanted to call Google at 2 in the morning and asked her if she still loved me. And then say, but are you SURE you love me? I wanted them to love me. I wanted to buy a skateboard. I wanted to say Google bought my company. I wanted to sexually harass the other employees there. I couldnt help myself. I was in Google Fever.They said no.---(Id be hard-core like this woman) Im permanently sick of it!I got sick of one person, or one company, or one decision-maker having any power over me. Its an internal choice, of course, but also an external one. You can set up your entire life to be diversified in every way so a no turns from shit to fertilizer.Everyone knows this in investing. One time, with my last dollars left, I bought a bazillion shares of Sonus Networks only to watch it go from $7 to 18 cents before it rebounded (long after I sold it for a mega-loss). I got crushed and left on the floor. My 3 year old wanted to play with me. There was zero chance I was getting up off that floor to take her to the park. She had to bounce a ball up and down right next to me. It was annoying me so I picked her up and put her on the pool table so she couldt get off until someone came and got her.The only way to survive, to get off the floor, to build, to have ideas, to create businesses, to have flourishing relationships, is with diversification. And with the greatest invention since the wheel, the Internet, its easier to do it now than ever before.---9 Ways To Diversify Your Life- Start more than one business. Start many businesses. Or jobs. Or careers. Start them at the same time. Eventually one will stand out as the one flourishing. Im watching this happen to a good friend of mine right now. He has his hand in ten different businesses. He also has at least one fulltime job. One is bursting through and hes able to make his decision as to where to go  the one that will make him fabulously wealthy while having fun.Well, what if you have a job? Get two jobs. Apply for more jobs. Always figure out what your value is on the job marketplace. I am on the board of a temp-staffing company called Corporate Resource Services. I dont know what I can legally say about it (its a public company). All I can say is: it fits my idea that the 21st century is moving towards an employee-less economy because of all the regulatory and economic uncertainty. Companies are not hiring permanent employees. So youre going to need to diversify your sources of income starting right now.- Diversify the way you meet people. We are no longer limited to just our coworkers and neighbors. Life is global. We can meet people through the Internet, through travel, through classes on every topic possible. Pick the people who will be the most positive in your life. People who you can look up to, who can look up to you. Eliminate everyone else. Not in a cold or cruel way. But in a way that makes sure you put the importance back on yourself. Make sure you are your own center of gravity. Anyone whose gravitational pull becomes too great needs to be put on Halleys Comet status - once every 76 years and thats it.- Diversify ideas. Many people ask me, when Im working on my list of ten ideas for the day so as to build the idea muscle, should they all be business ideas, or ideas around one sector? No! Write ideas about anything you can. Then mate them. Heres an exercise right now. Make two columns. At the top of each column, write an interest. Then write down five ideas for each that has to do with each idea. Now cross-fertilize them. Come up with many ideas combining the two columns as possible. You will never be the best in the world at anything (unless you are, then ignore this), but you can be good at many things. The beauty of that is that you then become the best in the world at the intersection of all these things. Its at that intersection that you can completely direct traffic and change the world.- Creative output. Everyone wants to create their masterpiece whether its a business, an article, a book, a speech, whatever. Heres the problem: you cant do it. Its not going to happen. The only way you have any control over it is by sheer output. You have to crank it out. Woody Allen has written over 46 movies. A good chunk of them Im sure he would never want to look at again. Isaac Asimov has written over 500 books, some of them outright boring and yet he created The Foundation series and I, Robot. Thomas Edison has 1093 patents but we remember him today for just one of them. Einstein wrote 245 papers but we remember him for one equation. Buddha taught every day for almost 60 years and we remember him for his eightfold path. Bukowski wrote 71 books and probably only three or four of them stand out as truly stunning. I can go on and on. The list is endless. being prolific means you diversify your creativity, means you create the platform by which people can find you. Gives you more stop signs you can put up in front of peoples lives to direct them back to the home where you live.THIS MEANS YOU WILL FAIL A LOT. Failure is an acquired taste. You have to really experience it quite a bit to savor it. And then your roll with it without the extra burden of disappointment. When you are disappointed in a failure its as if youve not only paid the price but you got nothing for it. Eventually you learn to get something for it.One more note: reading this one makes me feel stressed out. You dont have to do it all in a single day. Isaac Asimov took 40 years to write his 500 books. So did Bukowski and others. Take your time. But mark the X each day that says I did it, even if it was only a little.- Diversify your platform. If you are trying to build a presence in social media, then you cant just blog. You cant just be on Facebook or Twitter. You have to self-publish on Amazon, you have to blog, you have to tweet, you have to be on Facebook and have a fan page there, you have be on Quora, Pinterest, LinkedIn. And you have to be there repeatedly. If you self-publish once, do it twice. Theres two schools of thought: wait until you have your masterpiece, or just do it. In this world, just do it works best. Because what you do will be forgotten ten seconds later so youre going to need to do it again. Hopefully better.I did this because I got sick of waiting around for mainstream media (or mainstream anything) to pick me. I wanted to choose myself and not wait for some unhappy college graduate to say no to me.- Diversify the people you meet and the people who inspire you. Im shy. And I like to sit at home and not answer the phone or return emails. So heres what I do. I try to meet three or four people a week to see what I can learn from them. I usually schedule it Monday-Tuesdays so I stay overnight in the city and schedule the meetings back to back in the same place. This is a little different than Diversify the way you meet people. That above one applies to going places and just throwing yourself in situations where you are bound to meet new people in your life.- Diversify what you read. Or learn. When you go out today for a cafe take four books with you: one about your top career, one about your top interest or hobby (unrelated to your career), one thriller, and one book about spirituality or history. Read a little from each. Is there a reason to do this? I have no idea! But I know after about twenty years of doing this trick every day its helped me to come up with better ideas (and also some pretty bad ones).- Diversify your health. Just because you eat well, doesnt mean youre healthy. You need to be honest with yourself here. List the things you do that you KNOW are not the healthiest for yourself. You dont need to cut everything at once. But figure it out. Its got to be painful to be 90 years old and know that if you had done just a few things differently it wouldnt hurt so much every time you went to the bathroom.- Diversify your thoughts. I spent too much of my life thinking about money. And then thinking about women. And sometimes thinking about money and women at the same time. I dont know how they counted this but someone once told me we think 60,000 thoughts a day. All 60,000 of mine would sometimes be about money and women, with a little about food and defecation. Meanwhile, theres 100 billion other fun things to think about each day. I live 100 feet from the Hudson River. Across from me on the river is West Point. Mountains and leaves surround all of it. It would be so easy for me to diversify into pleasant things but too often Im obsessed down one category. Obsession and Anxiety is equivalent to Subtraction of thoughts. It makes you a counterfeit person instead of an authentic person.Diversification of thoughts is the only way to slow life down, to let the thoughts simmer instead of boil, to marinate instead of just lightly spice the insides of our spirit.When properly diversified, nobody can say no to you anymore. Disappointments and failures become a natural part of life that you learn from, in the same way you learn from success and opportunity. Intelligence springs forward from the additional creativity. Love comes from the most blossoming part of the social tree you build for yourself.Your center becomes a powerful gravitational force, drawing people, success, and presence you havent felt before. Nobody can hold you prisoner. You dont need fuck you money to fly away. You just to spread your wings.(Photo by Mez Love)]',\n",
       "  102: '[I don\\'t know if I\\'m very productive. I take naps during the day. Sometimes I start businesses that fail. I often go down paths that lead to dead ends. OFTEN.At the same time, I\\'m on the board of some very successful companies. I\\'m a successful investor. I write a lot. I have a top podcast (e.g. more than 15 people listen to it). I look at my calendar for next week and everything I\\'m doing is something I love doing. It took me a long time to build up to this level of productivity but that\\'s because I wasn\\'t doing so well the things I list below.I wish I had started doing these things earlier.Most important: I love my wife and I think she loves me. Sometimes I don\\'t know if she loves me.Perhaps my most unproductive time is when I am wondering if she loves me.I always need to work better at wondering what people think of me. We are trained by evolution to wonder. Don\\'t feel bad for yourself if you wonder too much. Blame evolution.But I like to do the opposite of evolution here and be fine regardless.I also get annoyed at my kids sometimes. This is very unproductive. Like, if one is late and I\\'m just sitting in the car. But I have a trick for making that time in my life productive as long as I\\'m not yelling at her or getting angry.Anger is never productive. Some people are foolish and think that anger drives them forward but it doesn\\'t. Anger stabs at your heart and then your heart closes. You need your heart to be open.How come? Because neurons transmit messages from your gut to your heart to your head.Everything needs to be open so your neurochemicals transmit messages efficiently.So the first question is: what is productive?I like to be in love with people and my favorite hobbies. Then I like to be moving forward at those things. And all other times I like to be sleeping or thinking of nothing.This is not a goal but a theme. I live life by themes. If today I live by my themes then I have a good day.That is success for me.What are side effects of success? Kissing and sex and smiling. Some laughing. Talking to people who make me think. Reading about interesting things.Feeling that fire-like feeling in my chest when I\\'m doing something I\\'m proud of. And money is a side-effect.Note that money is not a goal.Having money as a goal makes it very hard to make money. Money is a side effect of the daily routine I am about to tell you.You can say, \"you need money to pay bills.\" Yes, sometimes it\\'s been very hard for me to pay bills. In my life I have been in pain often over how to live with no money. But I\\'ve NEVER made money without it being a side effect of a successful routine.And when I have bad routines, I lose all my money. Simple.These are all just side effects. And they are all happening in my life right now.MY ROUTINE:First off, I\\'m going to love you today. I picture you, the reader, and I\\'m in love with you. I\\'m grateful you are reading this. I do this with completely selfish reasons.This makes a flood of oxytocin trigger in my brain so I can keep writing this and I\\'m happy doing it.I woke up at 5:30am. I read books and had coffee. Oh, and I did about 30 pushups but then it got too hard for me so I\\'ll do more later. It would be great if I could do 6000 pushups but I can\\'t. I\\'ll just do what I can.What books did I read?\\n\"I, Mammal\"\\n\"The Untethered Soul\"\\n\"The Last Girlfriend on Earth\"\\n\"Podcast Launch\"\\n\"The Hidden Tools of Comedy\"\\nI try to read 5-10% of each book when I sit down to read. I rotate through books so tomorrow might repeat this list or might be new books.Then I write. I\\'m writing right now.I\\'ll shower and brush my teeth. It\\'s good to be clean. 8 hours of sleep last night. Some exercise. Cleaning. Reading. Writing. I\\'ll be done with all of this by 10am today.I\\'ll eat well. For me that means less carbs. Some people that means more carbs. Some people it means less calories. Some people will eat food they enjoy and it doesn\\'t matter what it is. It makes them happy.I eat at 10am and then around 3pm and that\\'s it.I\\'m only going to be around people I love today. I\\'ll call some friends. I\\'ll be with my wife. Spend time with kids.I\\'ll respond to emails but only people who I love and respect and want to help and I hope they feel the same way about me.I NEVER respond to people I don\\'t like. Why should I? Someone, for instance, wrote me last night an email that was insulting. He got instantly deleted and blocked. Not that I need to avoid him to be happy but there\\'s just no point in interacting with him.I have a couple of email tricks I do every day:a. I\\'ll find someone from 3-10 years ago that I will send an email to. Someone I miss but have always liked. I\\'ll act as if we just spoke yesterday. It will be fun. 100% of the time they respond.b. I\\'ll find two people I think should meet each other. I\\'ll first ask permission from both: \"can I introduce you to so-and-so?\" If they both say \"yes\" then I\\'ll make the connection.I call this \"permission networking\". My network is not the list of how many people I know. THE STRENGTH OF MY NETWORK IS HOW WELL EVERYONE I KNOW HELPS EACH OTHER. Most people don\\'t know this important principle.c. Finally, I\\'ll write to someone I want to meet. To do this I need to offer them something of value. So I have to be creative in my email.Most of the time I get no response on these emails because most people I want to meet have no clue who I am and don\\'t want to meet me. About one out of ten respond.You know who I wrote to so far today? I wrote to Coolio, the rapper. And Morgan Spurlock who directed Supersize Me. I\\'ll let you know if they ever write me back.Next I\\'ll try to be creative. I\\'m writing but that\\'s not enough. I need to come up with a list of ideas. It\\'s ok if they are bad ideas. It doesn\\'t matter to me. Just lots of ideas.I wrote today, \"10 ideas for businesses one can make around toilets\". I think I\\'ll put that on an Ask Altucher podcast. Maybe there\\'s one good idea there.If I don\\'t exercise my idea muscle every day I get less creative. I can actually feel the creative connections start to weaken from one side of my brain to the other.I might take an idea from the other day and combine it with an idea from today.I was thinking of making a sitcom revolving around Jewish Neanderthals. Maybe I will make a list of episodes. I don\\'t know. We\\'ll see.I will kiss Claudia. I will bow down and try to kiss her feet but she\\'ll reach down and say, \"no no no\" and laugh. She\\'s so predictable!Finally, I\\'ll take care of business stuff. Some businesses I\\'m trying to start. Other businesses I\\'m trying to help. If I can help them make money, I make money and pay my bills. Because I do everything else on this daily routine list, sometimes I\\'m good at doing this step. And then I will end the day much like I begin it.I\\'ll be grateful for the things happening in my life. I won\\'t just say \"thanks.\" I\\'ll think why I am grateful. I\\'ll even think of the things that are negative and be grateful that I can spend time looking for the positive in them.I call this being \"creatively grateful\". The more negative something is, the more creatively grateful I have to be.And hopefully the end of my day ends in romance. Either romance or a good book. Or a good conversation. Or good sleep (9 hours!)This is not my ideal routine. This is basically what I did yesterday.The best indicator of having a good day tomorrow is to have a good day today.* * *HayHouse, who published, \"The Power of NO\" has discounted the book (Kindle edition) from $10 to $1.99 for this week only.

       "  103: '[I lied to him to get a job. The hedge fund manager asked me how much money I had in the bank.I had ZERO but I said, a million dollars. This was in 2002.In the prior two years I had lost all the money I ever made and my home. Now I was broke.He said, how can you afford to live on that?Which strikes me as ludicrous now but I felt every blood cell in me turn upside down in shame then.I felt he would think it was courageous if I threw the question back at him.Well, how much money do you have?He said, one hundred million dollars. Who knows?One friend of mine told me something, you can never tell how much money someone has until they file for bankruptcy.I read a statistic that people lie (including white lies), on average, 10-200 times a day. I also read that people say, on average, 2500 words a day.So one technique to stop lying is to stop talking. I try not to talk. I try to say around 1000 words a day.The hedge fund manager and I then went out to dinner with his wife. He was cheating on his wife but I didnt know that yet.I had read all his favorite books so I was able to quote from them. What are your favorite books? he said. I quoted from those books (Ayn Rand). Then I quoted from a research paper he wrote in 1969 that I had found buried in some journal.He asked me, What are my interests outside of finance? I knew he liked baseball so I talked about various histories of baseball I had just read. Baseball is boring.The hedge fund manager gave me money to manage. It was my first job in the financial space. In a very short time I more than doubled the money he had given me.A year or so later I wrote a book about how I did it. He instantly fired me. He thought I had revealed too much. He wrote, our financial relationship is now over.I wrote, its not. You owe me money because I have made you so much. So he instantly sent a check.One day, I had to return my dads car to the dealership. My dad had a stroke and was in a coma and would never drive a car again. After I dropped it off the hedge fund manager called me and invited me to dinner.I went to the dinner and started drinking quite a bit. I was feeling depressed.To my right was the mistress. And in front of me was the hedge fund managers daughter.I was shy and had a crush on the daughter and so I blurted out the only question I could think of, so what do you think of [manager] and [mistress] being so out in the open?[Daughter] looked at [mistress] and said, I think she is a money hungry slut. And then she got up and walked out of the restaurant .I was horrified and embarrassed. [The wife] even wrote me the next day and was upset at me and [manager] was upset at me until finally I said to everyone, this is your family issue. I have my own family issues.Anyway, my book came out right after that and I was fired.All of this is to say, better to speak fewer words.Less lies, more time to listen and learn and think and daydream. Less embarrassing situations. Less masks to wear. My mental closet can only fit so many masks. The older I get, the less masks fit in that closet.More benefits of not opening your mouth: flies dont get in your mouth. Less food gets in your mouth so you eat better.You give less advice. Nobody listens to my advice anyway. People do what they want until they are injured like a kid putting his fingers on the stove.Telling the truth is easier. It means you just have to remember things.Telling a lie means you have to remember, AND THEN keep track of the lie. Too much stress! (Polygraph machines, in fact, work by measuring stress levels).Less mouth means you start to use your eyes and ears more. Like the way blind people can hear and touch better.Blind people seem to develop super powers with their other senses.People who talk less are like superheroes in the same way.If you become a superhero and see me lying homeless in the gutter, please save me.]',\n",
       "  104: '[Back in 1994 I was avoiding a bad situation at home and was staying up late at the office playing chess online at 1 or 2 in the morning.A guy named Seggev from Israel and I would play one minute chess all night long back when one minute really meant about 90 seconds because of lag on the Internet. I was so tired sometimes I couldnt tell if I was being checkmated or if I was just having a bad dream after a heartbreaking argument.Every two hours or so we would reluctantly agree to take bathroom breaks, 9000 miles apart. Whatever it was I was running from, he seemed to be running away from it as well.On one of my bathroom breaks I ran into the guy from the office next to mine. It was two in the morning. Why are you here? This guy had a new baby at home so it was meant as a rhetorical question. Im writing some software to catalog pages on the world wide web, he said. This new thing. I figure maybe I can get some government funding.Good luck with that. I went back to my office. Seggev was already back and challenging me to another game. When I finally went home at about 6:30 in the morning my girlfriend at the time threw her backpack at me. It was filled with books. The computer in the office next to mine was lycos.cs.cmu.edu. My friends company, Lycos, became the first major search engine. But we werent really friends.Lycos got sold to CMGI, then went public. Then crashed with the market and the advent of Altavista, Yahoo, Google. Bits and pieces got sold to a Korean company. Other pieces sold to a company in Spain. For awhile it was called TerraLycos. First it was in the urinal next to me. Then it was worth a billion dollars. Now its flushed down the toilet somewhere in Europe.Sixteen years later Im sitting with one of my daughters. Its dark outside and little hailstones flick at the window. The nights demons clamoring for our attention. She has insomnia and her mind is racing. Theres things I want to tell her:\\nFly kites as much as possible. While they are in the air, they keep you on the ground.\\nDont read the newspaper so much. They sometimes breed the worst horror fiction.\\nNever do anything you dont want to do. Even if it seems selfish at first, life is too short.\\nDiversify everything in your life, including the people you listen to for advice.\\nLearn lots of games. They turn you into a killer without you ever having to hurt someone.\\nThis is a clich, but never listen to anyone who says You cant do that. Those are usually the people who cant do it. Not you.\\nEven though life is short, theres also no rush. You have to put on a parachute before you jump out of a plane.\\nPreparation is the key to having good luck. And lots of it.\\nEvery day is an adventure even though you might not realize the specifics of it until years later.\\nEventually she fell asleep and I went upstairs. I try to close my eyes but I cant sleep. The rain stopped and the house is dead silent. Theres going to be a day when she has to do it all on her own, without anyone to sit quietly with her while her mind speeds away.]',\n",
       "  105: '[One time I was so lonely I wrote an ad in Craigslist telling people I had psychic powers.The ad was a lie. I wrote, I had a big headache and when I woke up I had psychic powers. I will tell anyones future if they just write to me.Several of the women who responded are now my Facebook friends. I only responded to the women who wrote me.I had just gotten separated from my ex. I was suicidal. I had lost a lot of money. I had no job. Nobody in my family spoke to me. I didnt have any friends to call. It was Thanksgiving.In other words, all the qualifications of a psychic.A girl invited me over for Thanksgiving but then she had to take back the invitation.How come? I said.My daughter Googled you and saw you were married. She said, mom! Why are you always going out with married men.?But Im separated!Im sorry.And then I had a turkey sandwich on white toast at the Red Flame Diner. I wanted to ask out the waitress but I was too shy to talk to her. Then I went back up to my hotel room where there was a bunch of emails waiting for me.I hit bottom. Worse than bottom. Needless to say, I was psychic for a day. The best way to be psychic is to start off telling people that one day in the distant past they had a haircut they didnt like and they were very upset about that.That had happened to me when I was 12. To his credit, my dad then called the girl I liked and told her not to make fun of my haircut. 33 years later, that girl and I are now Facebook friends.Anyway.I explored bottom a little bit.In my anthropological study of bottom heres what Ive discovered:\\neverybody has stopped choosing you: wife, boss, money, publishers, newspapers, people who hand out opportunities, girlfriends. You get unchosen by everyone. Maybe even your health unchooses you. Youve become the opposite of The Chosen. You are now the Chosen-less. Welcome to BOTTOM.\\nThe definition of bottom is that youve now been unchosen by everyone.\\nat the bottom we desperately try to figure out ways to be chosen. We want just one person to pick us for their team!\\nBut these things dont work. Everyone else is trying to be chosen also. They dont care about the bag of shit thats weighing us down. If anything, one characteristic of bottom is that we smell in some primal way. When you smell, its evolutions way of warning everyone else away from you.People write me every day. Every hour. Ive hit bottom. Im stuck. What can I do?I will tell you right now. First off, dont try to please anyone else. They cant choose you anymore. Youve hit bottom. Youre a loser.Follow this checklist one at a time. They are in order. Then you will get out of bottom.Trust me.1) Acknowledge that youve been trying to be chosen by other people or things. Stop that.2) Take a shower. You smell like bottom. Scrub hard. Wash your hair. Shave. Brush your teeth. Oh, go to the bathroom before you shower. Stand outside the shower naked, wet, take a picture of yourself and post it on Facebook (kidding).3) Sleep 8-10 hours. Sleeping is rejuvenating. You wont care if you go broke while you sleep. You also cant obsess on loneliness while you sleep. In general, sleeping is pretty good. If you are having trouble sleeping, take some natural remedy or take some anti-anxiety medicine. Whatever it takes  you need to sleep. I was addicted to Klonopin for quite some time when I had to learn to sleep.4) Bed Yoga. For ten minutes before you go to sleep and for ten minutes when you wake up, just be quiet and stretch.Stretch more. Breathe deep. Look for the light thats peeking out of the window, listen to the sounds. Stretch some more. Think of the things you are grateful for, even if they are few. Im going to start a nationwide craze for Bed Yoga.5) Exercise. Take a walk for ten minutes. Thats it. Were trying to get off of bottom here. You dont need to go to the gym for an hour.When you walk try to look at the rooftops. Find the prettiest rooftop.Look at the people who pass you. Each one is absorbed in their world. They are all time traveling to their regrets or their fears. Just for a little bit you can walk and you dont have to time travel.6) Protein. Dont load up on carbs today. Eat eggs. Then eat fish for a late lunch, early dinner. No carbs. Just try it. It cant hurt. I promise you you wont starve. People eat well in the United States. And dont eat a lot. Late breakfast, early dinner. Thats it.7) No alcohol. Alcohol is a depressant and causes cancer and stomach troubles. Why add that to your misery? I get it  you lose inhibitions on alcohol and that helps you to be more courageous. But you dont need it today. Theres nothing to be courageous for.8) Dont talk to people who will put you down. If you have to be around them ( a boss, a child, a parent, a spouse, etc) then just dont engage. Dont gossip with them. Dont try to please them. Dont call them back. Dont say to yourself, well, I have to call them back. You dont. Do you think 100 years from now it will matter if you call them back today? 100 years from now nobody will care at all what you did today.9) Read. Read books that will make you smarter or that will make you laugh. Or books that will make you feel spiritual. Actually, this morning read all of the above. Every since I hit bottom I try to read all three categories every day. This is not to say, oh, Im so great, I read these three types of books every day. Its just that if I dont I can hit bottom again. Gravity works on the soul. If you dont keep it up, then gravity drags it down to the bottom again. I hate that.10) Write. I write every day. Im writing this. Sometimes I write bad stuff. Sometimes I write ok stuff. Sometimes I write things Im happy with. But everything I write exercises my brain. The brain is constantly forming connections between neurons. if you dont use those connections they start to freeze and then stagnate.Repeat 1-10 tomorrow.11) Surrender. If you do all of the above, then theres nothing else you can do. You did the prep. Theres no excuses. Theres no reason for you to say, I cant enjoy the summer. My bike is broken! So what? Youll find other ways to enjoy it. Take the 10 day excuse diet. You dont need excuses anymore.Excuses are for people trying to be chosen by others. When you choose yourself there are no more excuses.If you did #1-10, you did the preparation. Youre still at bottom. Youre still broke and lonely. People are still not choosing you. But you are choosing yourself.Im not psychic. I lied to everyone because I thought it would make people like me.But then I started to choose myself and I came all the way back. For now.(Photo by Mark Hooper)]',\n",
       "  106: '[The way to have good ideas is to get close to killing yourself. Its like weightlifting. When you lift slightly more than you can handle, you get stronger. In life, when the gun is to your head, you either figure it out, or you die.When you cut yourself open, you bleed ideas. If youre broke and close to death, you have to start coming up with ideas.If you destroy your life, you need to come up with ideas to rebuild it.The only time Ive been FORCED to have good ideas is when I was up against the wall.My life insurance policy was like a gun to my head: Come up with good ideas OR ELSE your kids get your life insurance!At an airport when I realized a business I had been working on for four years was worthless.Or when I was sitting in the dark at three in the morning in the living room of the house I was going bankrupt and losing my home, my brain figuring out how to die without anyone knowing it was planned.Or when I was getting a divorce and I was lonely and afraid I wouldnt make any money again or I wouldnt meet anyone again. Or my kids would hate me. Or my friends would be disgusted by me.The problem is this: youre NOT in a state of panic most of the time. States of panic are special and have to be revered. Think about the times in your life that you remember  its exactly those moments when you hit bottom and were forced to come up with ideas, to get stronger, to connect with some inner force inside you with the outer force.This is why its important NOW to strengthen that connection to that idea force inside of you. This post is about HOW.Nothing you ever thought of before amounted to anything  thats why you are exactly where you are at that moment of hitting bottom. Because all of your billions of thoughts have led you to right there. You cant trust the old style of thinking anymore. They came, they saw, they lost.You have to come up with a new way of thinking. A new way of having ideas. A new ways of interacting with the outside universe.Youre in crisis. Time to change. Time to become an IDEA MACHINE.People know what runners high is. Its when you are running for a long time, at the point of exhaustion, and then something kicks in and gives you a second wind.400,000 years ago people didnt jog for exercise. They didnt even have jogging shorts. Or sneakers.400,000 years ago people need to eat and live. And either youre running to catch a prey, or you are running from a lion. Youre the prey! And you need that second wind in both cases or you DIE.The same thing happens in the brain. When you are about to die, a second wind kicks in. Ideas, experiences, opportunity, and probably hidden forces and neurochemicals we dont understand.But you cant get runners high unless youre ALREADY in good shape. Unless you are already able to run long distances.This is why its important to exercise the idea muscle right now. If your idea muscle atrophies, then even at your lowest point you wont have any ideas.How long does it take this muscle to atrophy? The same as any other muscle in your body: just two weeks without having any ideas. Atrophied.If you lie down in a bed for two weeks and dont move your legs you will need physical therapy to walk again.Many people need idea therapy. Not so that they can come up with great ideas right this second (although maybe you will) but so that people can come up with ideas when they need them: when their car is stuck, when their house blows up, when they are fired from their job, when their spouse betrays them, when they go bankrupt or lose a big customer, or lose a client, or go out of business, or get sick.IDEAS ARE THE CURRENCY OF LIFE. Not money. Money gets depleted until you go broke. But good ideas buy you good experiences, buy you better ideas, buy you better experiences, buy you more time, save your life. Financial wealth is a side effect of the runners high of your idea muscle.Whoah! That was a big intro.Depending on where I post this, some people will write tl;dr which I had to look up and it means too long, didnt read. I encourage those people to stop reading here and save yourself the trouble. Its ok. Im not mad at you. Ill write smaller articles also. Ill even draw cartoons.Ive often written about the idea muscle as part of what I call my daily practice. Every day I have to check the box on physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health.And I get a lot of questions about it so I will try and answer them here. If you have more questions, ask in the comments and I will answer.Sometimes people ask, did you only start coming up with ideas because you already had it made?ANSWER: I was on the floor crying because I was dead broke and dead lonely and had no prospects so thats why I had to do it.So now, 1000 words in (tl;dr) The Ultimate Cheat Sheet for Becoming an Idea Machine.Below is what I do and what works for me. If you have anything to add, please add them in the comments, I need all the help I can get.A) WHAT DO YOU MEAN  IDEA MACHINE?You will be like a superhero. Its almost a guaranteed membership in the Justice League of America.Every situation you are in, you will have a ton of ideas. Any question you are asked, you will know the response. Every meeting you are at, you will take the meeting so far out of the box youll be on another planet, if you are stuck on a desert highway  you will figure the way out, if you need to make money youll come up with 50 ideas to make money, and so on.After I started exercising the idea muscle, it was like a magic power had unleashed inside of me. Its ok if you dont believe me. Or maybe you think its bragging. There are many times when I dont have ideas. But thats when I stop practicing what I am about to advocate.Try it for yourself. Im not selling anything here. I have no reason for you to try this. I just want to share my experience. Its like part of your brain is opened up and a constant flow of stuff, both good and bad, gets dropped in there.From where? I dont think about it and I dont care. But I use it.In early 2009 was one of those times when I desperately needed to do this. I was fulltime either trying to find a girlfriend or I was trying to start a business or both. I was also going broke in the stock market and losing my home.Every night, Id have waffles for dinner and a bottle of wine and start writing ideas down. This is before I went paleo (no waffles!) and stopped drinking alcohol and I was writing 10-20 of the most ludicrous ideas a day down.And you know what ? It worked.B) HOW DO I START EXERCISING THE IDEA MUSCLE?Take a waiters pad. Go to a local cafe. Maybe read an inspirational book for ten to twenty minutes. Then start writing down ideas. What ideas? Hold on a second. The key here is, write ten ideas.C) WHY A WAITERS PAD?A waiters pad fits in your pocket so you can easily pull it out to jot things down.A waiters pad is too small to write a whole novel or even a paragraph. In fact, its specifically made to make a list. And thats all you want, a list of ideas.A waiters pad is a great conversation starter if you are in a meeting. Someone at the meeting will eventually say, Ill take fries with my burger and everyone will laugh. You broke the ice and you stand out.A waiters pad is cheap. You can get about 100 for $10. This shows you are frugal and dont need those fancy moleskin pads to have a good idea.Oh, and I just found out another reason for a waiters pad while I was writing this.Someone with alcohol on his breath, a bottle in hand, looking like he could crush me with one hand, just came up to me in the cafe Im sitting at and asked for money. I held up my waiters pad and said, Can I take your order? and he said, OH! and he walked away.D) WHY TEN IDEAS?If I say, write down ten ideas for books you can write I bet you can easily write down four or five. I can write down four or five right now. But at six it starts to get hard. Hmmm, you think, what else can I come up with?This is when the brain is sweating.Note that when you exercise in the gym, your muscles dont start to build until you break a sweat. Your metabolism doesnt improve when you run until you sweat. Your body doesnt break down the old and build the new until it is sweating.The poisons and toxins in your body dont leave until you sweat.The same thing happens with the idea muscle. Somewhere around idea number six, your brain starts to sweat. This means its building up. Break through this. Come up with ten ideas.E) WHAT IF I JUST CANT COME UP WITH TEN IDEAS?Heres the magic trick: if you cant come up with ten ideas, come up with 20 ideas.F) BUT IF I CANT COME UP WITH TEN, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO COME UP WITH 20?For the obvious reason. You are putting too much pressure on yourself. Perfectionism is the ENEMY of the idea muscle. Perfectionism is your brain trying to protect you from harm. From coming up with an idea that is embarassing and stupid and could cause you to suffer pain.We like the brain. But you have to shut the brain off to come up with ideas.The way you shut the brain off is by forcing it to come up with bad ideas.So lets say youve written 5 ideas for books and they are all pretty good. And now you are stuck. How can I top this brilliant list of five!?Well, lets come up with some bad ideas. Heres one: Dorothy and the Wizard of Wall Street. Dorothy is in a hurricane in Kansas and she lands right at the corner of Broadway and Wall Street in NYC and she has to make her way all the way down Wall Street in order to find The Wizard of Wall Street (Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs) in order to get home to Kansas. Instead, he offers her a job to be a high frequency trader instead.What a bad idea! Ok, now go onto the next 15 ideas. (and it anyone wants to buy the movie rights to The Wizard of Wall Street please contact my wife Claudia.)G) HOW DO I KNOW IF AN IDEA IS A GOOD IDEA?You wont. You dont. You cant. You shouldnt.Lets say you come up with ten ideas a day. In a year you will have come up with 3650 ideas (no breaks on weekends by the way if you want to get good at this). Maybe more if you are trying to do 20 ideas a day.Its unlikely that you came up with 3,650 good ideas (after you become an idea machine your ratio goes up but probably in the beginning your ratio of bad ideas to good is around 1000:1).Dont put pressure on yourself to come up with good ideas. The key right now is just to have good ideas. When Tiger Woods is practicing he doesnt get disappointed himself if he doesnt hit a hole in one every shot. Youre just practicing here.Practice doesnt make perfect. But practice makes permanent. So that later on when you do need good ideas to save your life, you know you will be a fountain of them.When theres a tidal wave of good ideas coming out of you, you only need a cup of water out of that to quench your thirst.H) HOW DO I EXECUTE ON MY IDEAHeres what I do often when I am writing down ideas that I think I might want to act on.I divide my paper into two columns.On one column is the list of ideas. On the other column is the list of FIRST STEPS. Remember, only the first step. Because you have no idea where that first step will take you.Imagine you are driving 100 miles to your home late at night. You turn on your headlights so you can see in front of you. All you can see is about 30 feet in front of you but you know if you have the lights on the entire time, youll make it home safely, 100 miles away.Activating the idea machine is how you turn the lights on so you can get home. But you dont need to do any more than that.One of my favorite examples: Richard Branson didnt like the service on some airline he was flying. So he had an idea: Im going to start a new airline. How the heck can a magazine publisher start an airline from scratch with no money?His first step. He called Boeing to see if they had an airplane he could lease.No idea is so big you cant take the first step. If the first step seems to hard, make it simpler. And dont worry again if the idea is bad. This is all practice.For instance, lets say one of my ideas is: I want to be a brain surgeon. My first step: I would buy a bunch of books on how to do brain surgery. I dont have to plan my whole way through medical school.Wait!? Did I just say I would be a brain surgeon without a medical degree? No. I simply had a bad idea and the first step I would take if I was going to execute on that idea. And, yes, Im absolutely confident I would be able to do successful brain surgery before someone throws me in jail (hence, the bad idea aspect of it).A real life example: In 2006 I had ten ideas for websites I wanted to build. I knew how to program but didnt want to. So my first step was to find a site like Elance and then put the spec up and find programmers in India who could make the websites for me. One of them I paid $2000 to develop and sold for $10,000,000 9 months later. (this is not bragging  I went dead broke about 2 years after that).Nine of the ten ideas were BAD. But you only need one.I) BUT IF IM COMING UP WITH BUSINESS IDEAS, HOW DO I KNOW IF IM ON THE RIGHT TRACK?Theres no way to know in advance if a business idea is a good one. For instance, Google started around 1996 but didnt make a dime of money until around 2001.Heres my favorite example. A company called Odeo was a software company to help people set up podcasts. Since I do a podcast now this seems like a great idea to me. So they raised a ton of money from professional venture capitalists.Then one of their programmers started working on a side project. The side project got a little traction but not much. But the CEO of Odeo decided to switch strategies and go full force into the side project without having a clue if it would work.He felt bad since this isnt what the investors invested in. So he called up all of the investors, some of the best investors on the planet, and described the side project to them and all the traction they were getting, etc and then made an offer, Since this is a different direction, Id be willing to buy all of your shares back so nobody will lose any money.100% of his investors said, YES! GIVE IT BACK! and so he bought all of his investors shares back. Now, Ev Williams, the founder of Twitter (which was the side project), is a billionaire as a result.Nobody knew. Nobody knows. You have to try multiple ideas and see which ones gets the excitement of customers, employees, and you can see that people are legitimately using it and excited by it.When I started Stockpickr someone once wrote me and said, please block me from the site. Im too addicted to it and its ruining my life. Thats when I had a sense that I had a halfway decent idea. And that was one of ten ideas I was trying simultaneously. The rest failed.So dont be afraid to test, fail, test, fail, try again, repeat, improve, test, fail again, and keep improving. The way to keep improving? Keep coming up with ideas for your business and for other new businesses.As your idea muscle improves, so will your ability to fail quickly. Failing quickly is a better skill than executing quickly.J) WHEN DO I SHUT DOWN AN IDEA?In 2009, I started The Leading Love Site on the Net. It was going to be a dating website where your twitter feed was your profile. Everyone I spoke to say, thats a great idea! I had already raised money and was raising more.Then, on the day I was going to close the fundraising round I woke up shaking. I had this vision of myself a year from now explaining to all of the investors why it wasnt going to work. I returned all the money. I was out the money I had spent to create the website.I can guess why it was a bad idea (people on dating sites want to be anonymous, for instance) but I didnt really know. I just knew I had to return the money.When your idea muscle is developed and the other legs of the daily practice are fully developed (Phyiscal, Emotional, Spiritual) youll have a better idea when you should shut things down. When you are shutting them down for the right reasons. When you are failing quickly as opposed to self-sabotage or fear of success or youre just stupid.That was the last time I tried to start a business. Since then Ive done very well by not starting businesses. Starting businesses is not the only way to make money in this world. There are many ways.K) HOW DO YOU KEEP TRACK OF YOUR IDEAS?I make a list of ideas and then I usually just throw them out.The whole purpose is to exercise the idea muscle. I know most of the ideas are bad ideas so I theres no sense keeping them around.If one of the ideas is good then I will probably remember it and build on it for the next day. Sometimes its kind of funny when I come across an old list of ideas to see what I was thinking. Every now and then I think I find a good idea in my old lists but its rare.And then what do I do with that rare good idea? Probably nothing.L) ARE ALL OF YOUR IDEAS BUSINESS IDEAS?No. Almost never. Its hard to come up with over 3000 business ideas a year. Im lucky if I come up with a few business ideas.The key is to have fun with it. Else you dont do it. People avoid things that are not fun.Heres some types of lists I make:\\nIDEA SEX. Combine two ideas to come up with a better idea. Dont forget that idea evolution works much faster than human evolution. You will ALWAYS come up with better ideas after generations of idea sex. This is the DNA of all idea generation.\\nOLD TO NEW: 10 old ideas I can make new. (Dorothy, Wall Street, etc). Similar to idea sex.\\n10 ridiculous things I would invent (the smart toilet, etc).\\n10 books I can write (The Choose Yourself Guide to an Alternative Education, etc).\\n10 business ideas for Google / Amazon / Twitter / you.\\n10 people I can send ideas to.\\n10 podcast ideas I can do. Or videos I can shoot. (Lunch with James, a video podcast where I just have lunch with people over Skype and we chat).\\n10 industries I can remove the middleman.\\n10 Things I Disagree With that everyone else assumes is religion (college, home ownership, voting, doctors). Or, for any one of those ideas. 10 ideas why!\\n10 ways to make old posts of mine and make books out of them.\\n10 ways I can surprise Claudia. (Actually, more like 100 ways. Thats hard work!)\\n10 items I can put on my 10 list ideas I usually write list.\\n10 people I want to be friends with and I figure out what the next steps are to contact them (Azaelia Banks, Im coming after you! Larry Page better watch out also.)\\n10 things I learned yesterday.\\n10 things I can do differently today. Right down my entire routine from beginning to end as detailed as possible and change one thing and make it better.\\n10 chapters for my next book.\\n10 ways I can save time. For instance, dont watch TV, drink, have stupid business calls, dont play chess during the day, dont have dinner (I definitely will not starve), dont go into the city to meet one person for coffee, dont waste time being angry at that person who did X, Y, and Z to you, and so on.\\n10 Things I Learned from X. Where X is someone Ive spoke to recently or read a book by recently. Ive written posts on this about the Beatles, Mick Jagger, Steve Jobs, Bukowski, the Dalai Lama, Superman, Freakonomics, etc.\\nRandom: 10 Things Women Totally Dont Know About Men. (that turned into a list of 100 and Claudia said to me, uhhh, I dont think you should publish this).\\nTodays list: 10 More Alternative to College I can Add to my book: 40 Alternatives to College.\\n10 Things Im Interested in Getting Better At (and then 10 ways I can get better at each one).\\n10 things I was interested in as a kid that might be fun to explore now. (Like, maybe I can write that Son of Dr. Strange comic Ive always been planning. And now I need 10 plot ideas).\\nA problem I have and ten ways I might try and solve it. This has saved me with the IRS countless times. Unfortunately, the Department of Motor Vehicles is impervious to my super powers.\\nThis is just a sample. Every day, 10 ideas. The other day, 10 ways I can release more endorphins into my body. Today is, 10 ways I can help people build their idea machine. Tomorrow is 10 Ways I can turn my next book into a webinar for Oprah. The day after that: 10 things I can talk about in my next talk (which means, developing an entire standup comedy act from scratch since I have a rule, if its not funny, then a tree fell in the forest and it didnt make a sound.)M) IS THE IDEA MUSCLE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT YOU CALL THE DAILY PRACTICE?No! They are all EQUAL.Imagine youre sitting on a stool. By the way, I only see stools in bars because you have to be drunk to sit on a stool. Its so uncomfortable. And then invariably, someone falls off a stool and then half the people laugh and half the people say is he ok? but everyone crowds around because we smell blood.So, now youre on a stool with four legs. If someone pulls away one of the legs you might still balance and the stool stays up but its tricky. If someone pulls two legs off, youre down for the count.The Daily Practice is to be: Physically, Emotionally, Mentally (the idea muscle), and Spiritually healthy.If you arent physically healthy you wont come up with ideas. Youll be coughing and vomiting.If you are around people who hate you, you wont come up with ideas. Because they will be yelling at you while you are trying to think.And if you arent feeling grateful and calm in your life on a regular basis, then you will be anxious and it will be harder to come up with ideas.So all four parts of the Daily Practice work together to come up with great ideas.N) DO I REALLY DO THIS EVERY DAY?Lets say you get tired for a day of writing ideas. Try something different. The key is to keep activating parts of your brain that have atrophied.Sometimes if I dont feel like writing down a list of ten ideas Ill do something else.Like Ill draw ten eyes.Or Ill make a collage.Or Ill take photographs of the ten most beautiful women I see today. Or the ten ugliest men (if I take picture of the ten most handsome men then I might get jealous and thats a whole other thing Id have to deal with).Or I might come make ten prank calls (well, when I was a kid I did that. I never do that now! Maybe).O) IS IT IMPORTANT TO READ BEFORE WRITING?I dont know. But I do. Heres what I do:At any given point I have about 10-20 books on my to go list. Books that I can just pop in and continue reading.Every day I read at least 10% of a non-fiction book that gives me tons of new ideas, an inspirational book, a fiction book of high-quality writing, and maybe a book on games (lately Ive been solving chess puzzles). And then I start writing.Right now the inspirational book is The Untethered Soul. The non-fiction book is Antifragile. The fiction book is Blind Date (Kosinski) and the games book is actually my chess app (Shreder) which has non-stop puzzles. But this list changes almost every day.P) HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?It takes at least six months of coming up with ideas every day before you are an idea machine.Then your life will change every six months. Ive said this before but my life is completely different than it was six months ago, and six months before that, and so on. So different there is no way I couldve predicted the differences.Six months ago I had no podcast. Now its a big part of my day. Six months before that, Choose Yourself had not come out. Six months before that, several I had not yet gone on several board seats that have done well for me. And so on.Q) DO I GIVE MY IDEAS AWAY FOR FREE?When you come up with ideas for someone else, always give ALL the ideas away for free if you think they are good ideas (remember: six months).I read recently one person said to give HALF of your ideas away for free and make them pay for the other half.This is very bad. This guarantees you will only come up with bad ideas. Because you will hoard your ideas. You will develop a SCARCITY COMPLEX around your ideas.Ideas are infinite. But once you define your capacity of good ideas (half) then they instantly become finite for you. Not for anyone else. But just for you, your ideas will be finite.If you stick to an abundance mentality, and be grateful for the ideas that are flowing through you, then they will be infinite. Where they come from, nobody knows. But they will be infinite and lucrative for you.So give ideas for free, and then when you meet, give more ideas. And if someone wants to pay you and your gut feels this is a good fit, then give even more ideas.R) I KEEP COMING UP WITH IDEAS AND THEY KEEP FAILING. WHAT DO I DO?Theres this cult of failure that has popped up recently. That you need to fail to succeed.This is not true. Failure really sucks. You dont want to fail. There is an easy way to solve this. Take the word fail out of your vocabulary.Everything we do in life is a success. We breathe, we love, we practice kindness, we deal with other human beings. We improve. We have experiences. This is magnificent and abundant success. Just even being able to try new things is something to celebrate every day. To smile at another person. To play.Most things I try to do dont work out as I planned. But who am I to predict the outcomes of my preparation. My only job is to prepare.Everybody, EVERYBODY, is a poor predictor of outcomes. From the weatherman, to the stock analyst. But we can all be good at preparation.And once I prepare, I show up at the starting line. Then the whistle blows, the race begins, I try my hardest with the most amount of integrity, and the results are not up to me.Then I go back and learn from the race, I prepare more, I love more, I celebrate more, and I shop up for the next race. The whistle blows, and eventually good things happen. Preparation leads to Faith in yourself.I used to think good things never happen. I saw my father die without anything good happening to him. I thought my fate was going to parallel his. But every moment, this moment while you are reading this, you get to choose abundance, gratitude, kindness, integrity, goodness. Only you get to choose what is in your universe.When you dont choose, you excuse.S) IS IT REALLY WORTH IT TO BECOME AN IDEA MACHINE?Every day I come up with ideas. I havent had a business since 2009. And it failed, as mentioned above.Since then Ive made more money than I know what to do with because I come up with ideas for people, for companies, for me, for people who have no idea who I am, for random anonymous things.I then get invited to share my ideas. Sometimes I get paid for them. Sometimes I give them for free. Sometimes I get more introductions to people and sometimes I get a chance to advise companies that do well and make me money. And sometimes I write books.When youre an idea machine, everything you look at breaks down into a collection of ideas, just like physical objects ultimately breakdown into collections of particles if your eyes were subatomic microscopes. Your eyes and brains become sub-idea microscopes that see the ideas that become the building blocks for everything in society.See them, build them, change them, seed them, birth them, love them, live them. Ideas are the dark matter of the universe. We know its there but only those in the know can see them.- - -What do you do once you become an idea machine?This is what I dont know the answer to because you are the master of your life.Now you have super powers. Now youre ready to take your unique place in the world. You will know how to get to the Justice League satellite that orbits the Earth and solves problems at a moments notice.You will know what to do. I dont know. Nobody else knows. Youll do it and the world wont be the same.(Photo by Xurxo Martinez)]',\n",
       "  107: '[My wife was upset at me. You spent all weekend responding to comments on your blog, she said, and it was the one weekend without the kids and you were either on your head phones or playing chess or responding to blog comments. And then she walked away. Upset. There would be no way to make it up to her. The weekend was over.And I had big plans that weekend. An article was coming out 6am on Saturday and I have two Kindle Singles that I am putting out in the next few weeks. One: How to Be President of the United States in Ten Easy Lessons. And two, Scams. Plus Im in the middle of starting three different businesses. Only one peripherally related to porn.So what was I doing? Why was I procrastinating so much?I started to Google, How to avoid procrastination? There are a thousand blogs about this. A lot of it involves cutting a vein if you do something bad. Or taking pills of some sort. Ritalin. Whatever.I procrastinate every day. The most basic is: return so-and-sos email. A simple thing. I could write back Hi and that would satisfy the project. But I dont do it. I go online. I play scrabble or chess. I look at my blog stats. I look at my Twitter feed. My Facebook feed. My blog comments. Should I respond? My emails (which come last. Emails are so 2008). Then I repeat. I remember that rap song from 1992 that I want to hear it again. What was it again. Oh yeah. MC 900 Foot Jesus, The City Sleeps, I listen to it. Then I listen again. Then I repeat the loop (thanks Naval from Angellist for summoning up my entire process in 2 words).But now Im going to get right down to it.FIVE THINGS THAT ARE GREAT ABOUT PROCRASTINATION(Hold on, 2 more interactions on Twitter. Be right back. And now that you mention it, I think I want to listen to that MC 900 Foot Jesus Song again).Ok, Im back. I only had one more detour. Someone had tagged a post of mine on Facebook and I wanted to Like it. Check out the post: The Day Stockpickr Was Going to Go Out of Business  A Story of Friendship.Ok, where was I:THE FIVE THINGS THAT ARE GREAT ABOUT PROCRASTINATIONA) Do stuff you like. Presumably you arent vomiting on your bedsheets when you are procrastinating. Unless you are into that sort of thing. Presumably you are probably doing things you like a lot. Even if its Twitter. I love Twitter. Tweeting. Retweeting. DM-ing. And if not that, online chess. I play about 200 games a day, with a clock  1 minute each side. Its mindless. But I get constant stimulation? Am I great? No!? Ok, play again. Yes!? Ok, play again to confirm it. On and on. Mental troubles. (Note: see therapist)(One sec: the guy whose post I liked just IMed me a thanks. When I should be the one thanking him. He liked one of my posts to post it on his Facebook wall! Oops. The City Sleeps is over. Hit that weird looking replay button YouTube.)B) Listen. Your procrastination is telling you something. Maybe the idea you were working on is bad. I started a software project once that I was going to make into a company. But I kept doing everything BUT the software project. Procrastination is your minds way of saying: That bad! This good! and puts your body at work on something you enjoy. Listen to it. Ask, why am I really procrastinating. Maybe Im not calling the client back because I simply dont like him.Yes! Its true. If you DONT LIKE someone then you might not want to do business with them. People have this BS line, its not personal, its just business. No way! Thats why we procrastinate often. Because business, or anything you do, is personal. You arent a robot! You want to enjoy the things you do and be around people who uplift you and inspire you. And you procrastinate when your body and mind are telling you you dont like something.C) Delegate. Your procrastination is telling you dont like doing something. Delegate. Howard Hughes would procrastinate all the time. He personally invented oil drill bits that are still used in the oil industry. He developed techniques in the movie industry that are still used. He broke aviation records and owned the first transcontinental airlines. The guy was the Steve Jobs of the 1930s.Do you think he did the crap work all by himself. Like the accounting work when he was the largest electronics part supplier to the military during World War II. Of course not. He delegated. Often your procrastination is giving you a guided tour of the things you need to delegate (i.e. the things you are not doing while you are procrastinating).D) Stop. Why did I procrastinate and not go to that meeting. Or I was ten minutes late to the meeting. Or I didnt confirm a TV appearance in time and they replaced me. This happened to me a few months ago. The John Stossel Show wanted me on. I LOVE John Stossel. Why did I never confirm that Id go on the show when they asked me and then I ended up not going on.Because ultimately I didnt want to go into the city at night (I live 80 miles north) and go on TV for 3 minutes and then have to go 80 miles back. Thats a drag. Thats about 200 minutes altogether of doing nothing for those 3 minutes of TV. Id rather be reading, writing, IMing, playing chess, putting on my Superman outfit and saving lives, and all sorts of other things.E) Brainstorm. This is the only thing Im asking you here. When you feel an overwhelming urge to procrastinate. When you dont want to program something. Or you dont feel like writing a business plan. Or you dont want to go to a meeting, just brainstorm for a second: what are all the useful things you can be doing now instead of the boring thing you feel required to do. Maybe youre entire idea is bad. Your business is bad. Stand up and move to another room to begin the process.Its not impossible for you to have bad ideas. In fact, 99% of your ideas are bad. I once set up a dating service on top of Twitter. BAD IDEA. People want to be anonymous on a dating service. Not on Twitter. I kept procrastinating on raising the money. Finally, the money I had raised, I returned, and I shut the whole thing down instead of wasting two years of my life before it wouldve failed anyway.Instead, I keep a handy waiters pad with me at all times. Theres always things I need to brainstorm about (article ideas, business ideas, investing ideas, vlogging ideas, book ideas, SURPRISE! Ideas (everyone likes to be surprised). Often when Im about to procrastinate, the one discipline I try to do is go off to another table and start listing things for a few minutes.Heres what Ive realized, after thousands of hours of procrastination before, during, after companies, work, friendships, marriages, etc.Dont do what you dont want to do. Procrastination is great because it tells you what you want to do. It also tells you what is probably a bad idea, or something you should delegate.Not only that, it probably tells you what everyone wants to do. Like, in between the last paragraph and this one I went to the website for Cosmopolitan Magazine (I know, you probably didnt think I was that sophisticated). I looked at a few articles like How to Spot a D-Bag in 10 Seconds or Less. A D-Bag!!! Then I felt guilty so I switched to The Economist. First article: The Yangon Spring. No thanks. After Im done with this article Im all about D-Bags (and yes, it will be hilariously funny when someone comments here, I bet you saw just a picture of yourself in that article).I use Procrastination every day to make my life better. I do the things I want to do. I figure out what I need to delegate. I brainstorm ideas, and I find clues buried in my subconscious about what my future will look like.- - -Addendum: Note that I procrastinated while writing this article. It was originally titled, TEN THINGS But Five is good enough to make everyones life betterAddendum 2: In the last few paragraphs I wrote down an idea for a Vlog Im going to do for PBS involving my nudity, Cosmopolitan, and The Economist. I promise you will laugh. At my nudity.Addendum 3: Out of the 1000s of likes and comments this article will receive, someone always comments, Really LinkedIn? This article? What has happened to the good ol days. Feel free to write that comment. Then refer to the How to spot a D-Bag in 10 seconds article in Cosmo. Ditto for the Grammar-philes out there. Maybe there can be a business around D-Bag spotting. Like a Foursquare thing. Like, Im in the vicinity of 5 people who have been identified as D-Bags. Time to escape.I dont know. Think about it. While kayaking along the Yangon River.(Photo by Embot)]',\n",
       "  108: '[They fired me. They fired me as CEO. Then they fired me as a board member. Then they took away my shares. And now none of them ever talk to me.I started the company, I had the initial idea, I raised $30 million for it from A+ investors (i.e. \"rich people\").I bought two companies for it, I hired the first 50 employees, and then I was shown the door.The reason? I was a bad leader. Here are some things I didn\\'t know about my own company: I didn\\'t know what our product did. I didn\\'t know any of the clients. I didn\\'t know how much money we made. I didn\\'t know how much we lost. And I had crushes on the secretaries and maybe two or ten other employees.I would\\'ve gladly stuck my tongue in the ears of any of those employees. Eewww!But why was I fired?I just didn\\'t do anything... for... anyone.I never wanted to talk. I would lock myself in my office and people would knock and I would pretend not to be there.If anyone wanted to talk to me about \"vision\" I would just nod my head and say something like, \"make it happen\", like I was Captain Picard on the Starship Enterprise.Being a leader doesn\\'t mean you are the guy who runs things.Being a leader doesn\\'t mean you created something or you did something great in the past or some other person has given you any kind of authority.Being a leader happens RIGHT NOW, today, and can be done without money, without authority, and without anybody. First, you have to lead yourself.It\\'s a mindset. I\\'m going to make a list. Forgive me. Feel free to add to the list or add your own experiences in the comments. In fact, I would really appreciate if you can add to this list. After running 20 or so companies (most of them failures). After investing in 30 companies (most of them successes) after advising or being on the board of a dozen companies (most of them successes) and after being married twice (50% success rate), I have a sense of what I think a leader is. I may be wrong but this is my list. A) MORE SUCCESS FOR OTHERS THAN FOR YOUMost important by far: you care about the success of others more than you care about your own success. Everyone around you needs to ultimately become better than you. That\\'s how you lead. The light is in front of you and you take them to the light and then go back. If all the people around you achieve more than you, then life will be good. You don\\'t have to believe me. I\\'ve seen this happen repeatedly. It doesn\\'t matter if they are employees, investors, friends, spouses. If you just focus on this one principle in all of your actions then you are a leader. Today: figure out how the people around you can have a successful day. Hint: don\\'t stick your tongue in their ear. B) YES, AND: I just wrote a book called The Power of No. Buy it because your life will be better (and I am not ashamed of plugging it). But now I\\'m about to tell you to say \"yes\". Claudia had an idea for a joke this morning that she wants to start a talk off with. I had a suggestion to change it. I didn\\'t say, \"Don\\'t do that. Do this.\" I said, \"Yes, and...\" a technique used in improv comedy. What does it mean? I trust Claudia and value her thoughts so I if I just say \"no\"!\" it shows I haven\\'t given enough respect into the time she put into coming up with an idea. So I say \"Yes, and\" ... and say what is good about her idea and then how I think it can be made even better and why. I give all of her ideas and thoughts respect and add to them rather than ever subtract from them. CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM WORKS LIKE THIS:\\n\"Yes, and\"\\nList what\\'s good\\nHow you would improve\\nFigure out the vision that is the base of the idea that you are talking about.\\nConnect the \"Why\" of what you are suggesting to the initial vision. Does it work better than the initial idea?\\nBe open to the fact that you might be wrong. ALWAYS ALWAYS you might be wrong.\\nC) GRATITUDEI was talking to Lewis Howes yesterday. He\\'s an athlete turned multi-million dollar webinar and Linkedin expert after living on his sister\\'s couch. He was on my podcast a few months ago. I don\\'t have a voicemail set up on my phone. But Lewis told me his voicemail says, \"before you leave me a message, tell me one thing you are grateful for.\" He says the messages people leave blow him away. I always imagine a good leader is surrounded by people who call their mothers at the end of the day and tell them, \"Mom, you can\\'t believe what I did today. Let me tell you about it.\" Not that every day is fun. Because some work isn\\'t. But make sure every day your employees can call Lewis Howes and they have at least one new thing they can be grateful for. Maybe they learned a new skill. Maybe they met a new client and created value for that client. Maybe a client they hated was fired because you can\\'t let your employees get the disease that bad clients are all too happy to spread. D) THE 30-150 RULE (OR...THE VISION RULE)Below 30 people, an organization is a tribe. 70,000 years ago, if a tribe got bigger than 30 people there\\'s evidence it would split into two tribes. A tribe is like a family. With a family you learn personally who to trust and who not to trust. You learn to care for their individual problems. You know everything about the people in your tribe. At 30 people, a leader spends time with each person in the tribe and knows how to listen to their issues. From 30-150 people you might not know everyone. But you know OF everyone. You know you can trust Jill because Jack tells you you can trust Jill and you trust Jack. After 150 people you can\\'t keep track of everyone. It\\'s impossible. But this is where humans split off from every other species. We united with each other by telling stories. We told stories of nationalism, religion, sports, money, products, better, great, BEST! If two people believe in the same story they might be thousands of miles apart and total strangers but they still have a sense they can trust each other. A LEADER TELLS A VISIONARY STORY. We are delivering the best service because.... We are helping people in unique ways because.... We have the best designs because.... We treat people better because....A good story, like any story ever told, starts with a problem, goes through the painful process of solving the problem, and has a solution that is better than anything ever seen before. First you listened to people, then you took care of people, but now you unite people under a vision they believe in and trust and bond with.Companies live and die on this. One company I advise got built up by buying 200 regional offices, now they are unifying them under one brand. The key to their success is how powerful the story will be that they tell of that brand. Why are they delivering the greatest value? People need to believe in the story.By the way, this is how humans killed everyone else. Because now we could plan and coordinate in much larger groups than any other species. That\\'s why there are no other sapiens left on the world. Only homo sapien sapiens (i.e. \"humans\"). Proof: within 3000 years of humans first landing in Australia, no species was left that could put up a fight with us. We killed them all. Yay humans! E) CHANGEEveryone has pain they don\\'t want to feel. For instance, I might feel pain if someone makes fun of my looks. I used to feel pain if someone questioned my net worth, which I equated with self worth. If I\\'m CEO I might have pain if the \"numbers\" go down. So we do things to hide the pain. We might wear nice clothes not because we like the clothes but because they are buffers for the pain: nobody will make fun of my looks. Imagine all the things we do as buffers for pain. We might avoid going to the store because we don\\'t want to run into the people who cause us pain. We might hide some numbers because we don\\'t want investors to think we are bad CEOs. Soon, everything in our lives we might think give us pleasure (because we are now avoiding all the pain) are actually just buffers against pain and change. When you can get rid of the buffers against pain and change life becomes more insecure, but we become FREE. We live in a bigger world, a world where risk and beauty go hand in hand and we are no longer afraid of the underlying pains. A leader is always prepared for change. And realizes that pain is just opportunities to live in a bigger and more abundant world. This is the secret that most people forget when they build their brick houses and hide inside from the outside world so pain doesn\\'t seek them out. F) DIGNITYThe other day someone cancelled on my podcast at the last minute. I had rescheduled other meetings and even changed the time I would see one of my daughter\\'s plays so I could interview this person, a very very successful entrepreneur. She wanted to now reschedule but I said \"no\", even to the detriment of my podcast and all the people who work with me on the podcast who were looking forward to the interview. I wasn\\'t angry with the person. She\\'s running a business and was probably very busy. And people reschedule all the time. I just didn\\'t like that it was last minute. I had studio time booked and no space to fill it. I have a vision for my podcast. Everyone who comes on are people who have transformed their lives and created the lives they wanted to. I want my listeners to be helped by the transformative stories of my guests. The world is changing very fast and it\\'s scary. I want to help people be less scared and I know I am less scared when I hear the stories of my guests and learn from them. Although I\\'m relatively new at podcasting (7 months), I treat my podcast as if it\\'s already achieved the dream I have for it. The place where people come on to help others deal with the crazy changes happening in our world and economy. If I don\\'t treat my own projects with respect then how can I expect others to? If I don\\'t treat myself with dignity, then how can I expect the people around me to treat me, or even each other, with dignity?G) THERE\\'S ALWAYS A GOOD REASON AND A REAL REASONPeople come to you every day with problems. The problems are usually very good problems. \"The client is asking for too much\". Or \"Jill didn\\'t do her job right\" or \"My car broke down\". One time an employee asked to meet me outside the office. She was crying. I asked her what was wrong. She was afraid she was doing a bad job with a client. And she was. But it turned out the real problem was she heard one of my business partners talking poorly about her behind her back and this was affecting her every day at work. This was the real problem that had to be fixed. And it did. And then everything, employee, client, partner, etc went well.In 100% of cases there is a good reason and a real reason. A leader listens to the good reason and comes up with a solution. But then listens even more closely to try and figure out what the real reason is. There is ALWAYS a real reason. Listen for that and see if you can help. A good solution solves one problem. A real solution solves 100 problems. H) HEALTHA sick leader is not a great leader. A leader who is spending time with people not good for them is not a good leader. A leader who doesn\\'t constantly practice creativity is not a good leader. A leader who is not grateful for the abundance already in his or her life will never lead his vision into abundance. He won\\'t know how. There\\'s no such thing as instant health. There\\'s only such thing as practice and progress. All you have to do is check the box on progress. Progress compounds every day into enormous Abundance. I) LOVEWarren Buffett says he skips to work and that he would do the work he does for free. Maybe it\\'s easy for him to say that because he has 50 billion dollars. But I\\'ve gone through and read his letters from the 1950s when he was first starting out. These letters are not publicly available. I had to really try hard to find them when I wrote the book on them in 2004. But when he was broke and starting his business in his livingroom you can read from his letters that he loved what he did. He took glee in finding companies that nobody else knew about so nobody was looking when they became horribly undervalued and he would then buy those companies. Don\\'t do something just for the money. Money is a side effect of persistence. You persist in things you are interested in. Explore your interests. Then persist. Then enjoy all the side effects. J) LEAD YOURSELFYou don\\'t need to be leading anyone. Before I can lead anyone I have to lead myself. I have to read. I have to try and improve 1% a week. I have a handful of interests and I have a lot of experience. I have to get better at the things I\\'m interested in. I have to understand more deeply the painful experiences I\\'ve had, I have to every day practice the health: physical emotional mental spiritual, that I suggest to everyone else. Sometimes I don\\'t. And I feel it. But that\\'s ok. Don\\'t regret. Today is a new day. Today is the only day. The definition of \"success\" for me is: \"Is today successful?\" Because who knows if tomorrow will even exist. Today is the only day I need to think about success. And every successful tomorrow is determined by one thing: having a successful today.(Photo by David Spinks)]',\n",
       "  109: '[I probably shouldn\\'t post this. No, I take that back. I DEFINITELY shouldn\\'t post this.The fact is, I can\\'t read minds. But now I\\'ve been in so many meetings where I\\'ve read people\\'s minds and then they wrote checks to me that it\\'s almost embarrassing for me to admit it\\'s all been a trick and I\\'m about to tell how I did it.This is no joke. In fact, I hope there are not any big LinkedIn users here because if too many use the trick it might not work any more for me.But since I have this disease to just reveal everything I do I\\'m going to spill my guts here.This trick works in lots of situations: speeches, dates, casual encounters on the subway, but I\\'m going to focus on business meetings where you are trying to sell something: either a product or your services.I\\'ve been using this technique for about six years and it works.Let\\'s say you know the name of at least one person you\\'re going to be meeting. You have a new piece of software or you are applying for a job and you will be meeting the head of sales, for instance.You don\\'t know ANYONE else who will be in the meeting. Don\\'t even ask in advance or that might give away the trick.You go on LinkedIn and you look up the head of sales. DON\\'T connect with him. Again, that might give it away.You see two things: who his or her connections are and you see \"people who looked up X, also looked up Y\".Several of the people on that \"also looked up Y\" will be in the meeting. Trust me on this. That\\'s why other people looked them up.Also, do the cursory check on who the head of sales assistant is, who reports to him, etc. All of this is on LinkedIn.NOW: use Google and Facebook to look up EVERYTHING else about these people.Let\\'s say the guy who reports to him has photos of his last vacation in Idaho. Let\\'s say he was born in Virginia. Let\\'s say he went to school at Dartmouth. And, for whatever reason, he likes Zepella, the female cover band for Led Zeppelin.This exact situation happened to me.Ok, you get to the meeting and everyone introduces themselves. You already know who about 2/3 of the people are just because you\\'ve memorized their faces and names.But make a big show out of how you can\\'t remember their names. \"Ooops, I hope I\\'m not tested on any of this later.\" That gets people to chuckle and they realize they\\'ve already overwhelmed you with too much information.Now you\\'re all set. There\\'s a lot of things you can do here. I\\'ll tell you some of them.A) READ MINDS.You say at the beginning of the meeting something like, \"I don\\'t want to scare anyone but I can read minds.\" They chuckle again and they think you\\'re completely insane and they start looking at their watches.\"No seriously,\" you say, and you ask for volunteers. Undoubtedly someone will volunteer whose name two minutes ago you couldn\\'t even \"remember\".Select that person. \"You look like a Dartmouth guy to me..... and... hmmm... this is really weird but I\\'m getting an image of Led Zeppelin but all dressed like women.\"Do this one or two more times and people will be FREAKING OUT.Then you can say, \"ok, we better get this meeting started but I\\'m warning you... I know what you\\'re thinking.\"Or, even better, can you admit what you did. This shows how deeply you prepare and how much you are willing to work for them. This will get a lot of laughter.See? No deception, a little bit of magic, a little bit of the wonder of childhood, and now everyone is friends.B) BOND.This is a little more obvious but there are several \"stories\" that people bond over.A story is just a way two people can relate to each other even if they are complete strangers. \"Oh, you went to University of Iowa? So did I?\" sort of thing.People bond over several things: colleges, states they grew up in, teams they like, ages of their children. \"I have a 15 year old girl. Man, those teenage years are tough. Oh, you have a 15 year old girl also? You know what I mean, then.\" &lt;wink&gt;Make a list of all the bonding moments you can have with each person in the meeting. Try to touch on all of them.This may sound disingenuous but it\\'s not. You really are bonding on these things (it might be inappropriate if you didn\\'t go to the University of Iowa for instance). But I find that most people don\\'t do this basic preparation.C) OTHER.If you really want to take it a step further: find causes they\\'ve donated to. Donate to those causes and figure out how to bring it up in the meeting. If someone donated to a particular charity for an obscure disease it means someone close to them died of that disease.Maybe someone in your family did also. Sign up for a run next weekend. This is a bit more disingenuous and I don\\'t recommend it but, I can tell you, it works.Maybe they like a particularly obscure movie. Watch the movie the night before the meeting. Say, \"I just saw this incredible movie last night\" and mention it.You know what they will say? Their eyes will get bigger and they will say, \"I LOVE that movie.\" Don\\'t believe me. Just try it.Magic is not about special powers. Magic is not even about a stage and a trick. Magic is about preparation and surprise.One time I was going on a first date. I told the girl I had never been to \"Pinkberry\" before. I had never even eaten yogurt. So she said, \"Oh my god! We have to go to this one Pinkberry on 59th street.So we made a plan.An hour before we were supposed to meet I went to the Pinkberry. I got the name of the girl behind the counter. She was 15 years younger than me and from the Bronx. She was black. I told her what I wanted her to do when I showed up for my date. She laughed and agreed. I tipped twenty dollars.I let my date get there first. I texted I was lost and running two minutes late.Then I got there, said hello, and then I saw the girl behind the counter. She said, \"Oh my god, James!\" and we hugged each other.My friend said, \"do you two know each other?\" The girl behind the counter said, \"James is my favorite cousin! What the hell are you doing here. Don\\'t you know Pinkberry will rot away your insides? How\\'s the Chelsea Hotel treating you.\"I went out with that girl for about a month. She might even be reading this post. If so, I apologize for my deception. But I was a different person then.Maybe.(Photo by Bob Prosser)]',\n",
       "  110: \"[      No. N.O. If you run a business you have to say this word all day long, every day. No.You might be reading this on a subway. Say, youre taking the F train from Park Slope in Brooklyn to hedge fund alley on Park and 48th and youre reading this article.Dont be embarrassed. Say No out loud. Dont pay attention to the people sitting around you staring. You need to practice.Ok...do it right now. Please.Heres an example. A few years ago, Im sitting with a potential investor for the fund I was running at the time. I like this potential investor. Hes smart and knows other potential investors and most importantly, he enjoys my writing. We were closing a round on a fund on February 1.He asks if he can come in on March 1 instead due to liquidity issues. (No). Well what about if he puts in money right now but with a reduced fee structure (No). Well, what about giving better redemption privileges instead of an annual lockup (No.)Then he wants to tell me about these VC deals where his money is tied up (No. And note that this is a very difficult No. At the risk of making this parenthetical too long, its worth pointing out that everyone in this business likes to tell their stories and you MUST say No before they begin. The company thats about to sign a deal with WalMart China to sell their patented iVacuums. The other company that has Donald Trump Swimwear thats going to be the exclusive swimwear in every golf club in the country. Or the dental implants company that will revolutionize biting. The stories go on and on. The CEO put all of his mothers money into the company. The new company that has the mineral rights to the largest coal excavation in Greater China. On and On. Just say no. But its hard because the stories begin quickly and you sort of have to hold your hands up and say, oh yeah, I know that company. Please, I know it. Yeah, yeah, its that one. Yeah. Great. Yeah. No. No.).But thats not all. You not only have to say No a lot, you have to hear No a lot. This is much harder. You travel to Palm Beach to meet a high net worth investor and you go through your whole presentation before putting out your hand for an investment (No.)You ask your administrator to reduce fees until you hit $100mm in assets. (No.) For fund of funds managers: asking one of your funds for a mid-month estimate (No.  equivalent response: 50-100 basis points, give or take.) Also for fund of fund managers: can I have transparency into the portfolio (No.)A friend of mine gave me advice: Its not you. Dont take it personally when they say No.Its their problem. Ask again tomorrow.Which brings me to maybe. If the market is down will you still have an up year?(maybe). If the yield curve inverts will municipal bond funds be negative on the year? (maybe). Will you spend 150% of your time obsessing over your portfolio (maybe. But make the point that the portfolio is better off without you). Is alpha calculated by subtracting your beta times the S&amp;P return from your return (maybe). Can you just take this one meeting with the company (maybe). Can you just take this one meeting with the fund manager who buys, and then flips, life insurance policies from elderly in critical care units (May-, actually, No). Do you want to go to my charity events dinner? (Maybe. But No.).When I was a kid I used to sneak into my parents bookshelf and read the book, Dont say Yes when you want to say No (there was a lot of sex stuff for a 10 year old).Unfortunately Ive forgotten all of the insightful material. I say Yes. Can I lower fees? (No problem). Can I take a meeting with the younger cousin who wants to start a new fund? (Absolutely). Do you want to invest in my company (Sure. How much?) I know you havent done this in 10 years but can you help me design my website? (Sure, let me take a look). How about we have lunch? (Just tell me when and where). Can you finish writing the book by August? (Is 300 pages ok?)Its tough to make money. The only way to avoid wasting time is to say No as much as possible. Give a dollar to charity every time you say No. Flush ten dollars down the toilet every time you say Yes.---My latest book 'The Power of NO' is now available in Amazon and at your nearest Barnes and Noble.(Photo by Abhi)]\",\n",
       "  111: '[   Im an addict. For 20 years I replaced one addiction with another. I cant even describe all of them. Im actually embarrassed. Ashamed.I would cling to whatever addiction was making me happy at that moment. A fire sucks the oxygen out of everything in the room. When the oxygen is gone, the fire is extinguished. Then burnout occurs. Thats addiction. It takes every form.Addictions: Lets work 100 hours a week for fame, money, for sex, health, more fame, then F-you money, then stand on our heads, then get fancy artwork, big houses, guard dogs, pit bulls that kill people, bigger bank accounts. Heck, lets own the bank. Then lets double down on all of the above.Now there is a new addiction. All I want is freedom, a lot of people say. But freedom from what? Who is enslaving you that you cant get away from? Then people want freedom for their kids, or their parents, or their siblings, or their kids kids. Or five generations of kids. Where did all these kids come from?But still, its all for them. Everything I do.Then we get burnt out.There are two ways to avoid getting burnt out. These are the only two ways I have EVER succeeded in avoiding getting burnt out.A) Only do things you enjoy. This might seem obvious but it isnt. I only just started doing this in the past few years after being infinitely unhappy, getting divorced, losing money, losing jobs, careers, friends, everything I was clinging to. Eating a turkey sandwich in a diner by myself on Thanksgiving Day 2008. Fuck it. I was done.I used to go out every night. You never know, I would think. I used to go to every business meeting I was invited to. You never know, I would think. I used to go on TV every time I was asked. You never know, I would think. Maybe someone would SEE me. And call me and offer me and give me and want me and like me and love me. Maybe they would press the LIKE button on my face. [Note to self: invent TV sets with \"LIKE\" buttons so people can LIKE people they see on TV and that somehow gets transmitted back to the TV networks.]99% of meetings dont turn into money. 99% of the news is a lie (Trust me. I know them). 99% of TV is about scandal, murder, and cheating. 99% of the people on the street will lick the flavor right off your lifesaver if you let them.Every time you say YES to something you dont want to do, this will happen: you will resent people, you will do a bad job, you will have less energy for the things you were doing a good job on, you will make less money, and yet another small percentage of your life will be used up, burned up, a smoke signal to the future saying, I did it again.The only real fire to cultivate is the fire inside of you. Nothing external will cultivate it. The greater your internal fire is, the more people will want it. They will smoke every drug lit by your fire. They will try to ignite their own fires. They will try to light up their own dark caves. The universe will bend to you.Every time you say Yes to something you dont want, your fire starts to go away.You will get burnt out.B) Blah blah The Daily Practice blah blah. I put it like that because I feel I am always talking about it. But I will explain it in a completely different way this time.You are empty. I mean this literally. Our bodies are like little galaxies. Galaxies have billions of massive stars in them and yet the reality is the space between those stars is so gigantic that a galaxy is mostly empty. Thats like you. You are made up of atoms. Every piece of you. And yet the actual physical matter in an atom (protons, neutrons, electrons) take up only 1/50 of 1% of the space in that atom. The rest is empty.So you are empty. Theres nothing really there. The real you, the real fire, is inside this emptiness.We spend our lives afraid of the emptiness. We want to fill it with love, with money, with pleasures, with anything that could put off the ultimate decay and dissolving into that emptiness that happens to every object in the universe. Only the emptiness does not decay.The best way I have ever found to fill that hole is not to seek external motivations to fill the emptiness. But to ignite the internal fire that will never go out. To light up my own inner sky:Physically: Take care of the little matter I have: sleep well, eat well, exercise when I can. I want my atoms healthy. I want the emptiness inside of them to be relaxed.Emotionally: As empty as our atoms are, our emotions are even emptier. They are really just creations of an ephemeral mind that is mostly the creation of the brainwashing we grow up with. Our education that we get from society, our family, our friends. So emotionally I try to be only around positive people who inspire me. This way I can learn to be positive. To be a beacon to those around me. And I try to be quiet. Instead of speaking the average 2500 words a day that most people speak, it would be nice for me to speak 1000 words a day when possible.Mentally: Your mind desperately wants to be the BOSS. It needs you to be very VERY BUSY with BS stuff so it can do all the things its good at: obsess, worry, fear, depression, exuberance, forward thinking, backward thinking, thinking thinking THINKING until burnout.So you need to tame the wild horse or it will tame you until you are a slave. Nobody wants that. So the way you tame it is in focused use of it. Set a goal: Im going to come up with 10 ways I can have more time for myself. Or Im going to come with 10 ways I can make my job better. Or 10 business ideas. Make sure the list you plan to do is a hard list. You need to make the mind SWEAT so that it gets tired. So tired that its done for the day. It cant control you today. TIRE IT OUT! Then do it again. 10 MORE ideas.Ill tell you what I did today. Udemy.com asked me to come up with an online course. Maybe Ill do a course on The Daily Practice but I made a list of ten other courses I could maybe teach. It was hard! I didnt even know if I knew enough about ten different topics to be able to teach them. I still dont know. But I did the list. My mind sweated like a pig. And then you know what I instantly did afterwards?I fell asleep.After sleeping about ten hours the night before. Sleeping is fun. I love to sleep. Its a Saturday. It was 1pm. I took a half hour nap. My mind was tired. Then I woke up and wrote this.Spiritually: Everyone and everything is equally empty. When you look at anyone or anything its almost as if you are looking in a mirror. They have inside of them 99.999% emptiness just like you do. The one thing you can do that might be different: they might be obsessing on the past or the future. Dreaming or Hating. Worrying or Reliving. You dont need to do that.The past and future are empty also.I have money worries. I have relationship fears. I have insecurity. Will they like me, hate me, love me. Will I ever go broke. Will Claudia ever leave me like so many others have. All fears from the past, all worries of the future.All of that doesnt exist. Its my mind pretending they exist.I give up. I cant control the past or the future. They are empty, just like I am.Done.When you surrender and accept the beautiful stillness around you, when you give up all thoughts of the past, all worries and anxieties of the future, when you surround yourself with similar positive people, when you tame the mind, when you keep healthy, there is zero chance of burnout.This is the ONLY way Ive ever ignited the fire and avoided burnout. Think about the things we worry about. How, almost 100% of the time when we look back on it we realize how useless it was.Devoting ourselves to this Daily Practice, even if it only shows the tiniest of incremental improvements in our lives. These increments build up. Today they will build up. Every moment they will build up. Every moment they will shed the extra garbage on every level that you carry with you, the garbage that weighs you down, the external garbage that eventually goes on fire, burning you OUT, on the outside.Instead, igniting the fire on the inside, burns a light so fierce it cant be burnt out. Instead, you will brighten the galaxy. You will add brilliance to the lives around you. You will become a beacon, a light that attracts abundance, instead of a flickering fame that is eventually smothered.---How many times have you heard yourself saying \"yes\" to the wrong things  overwhelming requests, bad relationships, time-consuming obligations? How often have you wished you could summon the power to turn them down?Listen to this podcast I did with my wife Claudia. We talked about how our latest book will help you take back that power  and shows that a well-placed \"no\" can not only save you time and trouble... it can save your life.---Photo by Rana Ossama]',\n",
       "  112: \"[ After a failure I feel lonely and afraid. Its hardest at these moments to pick yourself up and give a little in order to get. The only way to climb out of the hole, when you have a metaphoric needle sticking out of your veins and youre lying in the gutter that the world has kicked you to, is to give back without asking, give as if you were the richest man in the world.This is not the same as giving to charity. There are so many other ways to give that are underappreciated. But its exactly these types of giving where the world will give you back ten times more than you gave.Heres 13 ways that Giving can help you Receive more\\nGive credit where it's due. Every day, give credit to your boss, your friends, your employees, your colleagues, even if it was your own ideas. Just give them credit. Everyone knows the reality. And the reality is YOU.\\nGive equity. When I started Stockpickr, someone wrote a blog post criticizing me for giving thestreet.com 50% of my business. One of my employees even quit, he was so upset at that decision. (Although hes since gone on to better things.) But that decision hooked thestreet.com into my business. Once the company was up for sale (which was the second after we launched the company) they were basically locked into my tractor beam to the point where they had to buy the company. If I had given them any less of the business Id probably be sitting on a worthless website right now, post financial crisis.\\nGive a customer more than they asked for. When I first did websites for New Line Cinema (in my old business, Reset), I offered to essentially do websites for all of their movies for almost free. That kept business coming from the whole Time Warner family and also gave my employees fun stuff to do in between doing websites for Con Edison and other boring companies. It also got clients for me because everyone thought our New Line sites were edgy.\\nGive up. Some businesses just dont work. Dont make the issue worse by raising money and being fooled by the prophets who tell you persistence is key. 140love.com was my latest bad idea. I put $30k into that baby and on the eve of raising $500k I told everyone to save their wires and not send the money. It was a bad idea. The ghost-site still exists. Knock yourselves out.\\nGive ideas. Ive told this story before, but when I was really down and wanted to get things going for myself, I came up with as many ideas as I could for other people and simply gave them away for free. The results were stupendous. Sit down every day, picture a person you can give ideas to, and come up with ten good ideas for them. At the very least this will exercise the idea muscle, which atrophies like any other muscle if its not in constant use.\\nGive time. Cornell, my alma-mater, recently asked me to donate some money, like they ask all alumni. I said theres no way I can do that, since Ive repeatedly written articles suggesting that parents not send their kids to college. BUT, I would be more than happy to give my time. So I went up, spoke to a bunch of groups of very smart, talented college students, and even found out about a business done by students who had just graduated that seemed interesting. I immediately came home and invested in the business.\\nGive silence. My daughter was crying. She was upset about nothing. Like girls her age sometimes get. But I sat down next to her and said nothing and just listened while her mind thrashed about a bit. Im glad I did it. Just to hear her laugh a little by the end of it.\\nGive to yourself. When I have a score, I give to myself. Ill stay in a nice hotel, or go on a nice trip, or buy some books, or take some time to go to an art gallery or museum. I take for myself when Ive been given. Which goes along with\\nGive thanks. Every day at the end of the day, I think of the things Im thankful and grateful for. You dont need to be good at meditation to be as enlightened as the Buddha. Just spend a few minutes a day counting the things you are thankful for. Im thankful for my family. Im thankful for the people who have remained friends over the years. \\nGive for free. Dont fool yourself into thinking that giving to charity is a good thing. Its a completely selfish act when you give $100 for someone to finish a 100 mile race for charity and you put your name all over the donation. If you really want to give, do it anonymous and stop waving it in front of our faces.\\nGive your honesty. When someone asks for your opinion on something theres so many incentives to lie. When someone asks you to dinner or out to an event, the first impulse is to be dishonest and say, sorry, my leg is breaking that day, I cant. But be honest and constructive in your honesty. Give value when you give your opinion. Help someone be better by making sure you are not only honest with them but really honest with yourself as to why your opinions are what they are. Where do they come from deep down. Make their lives better and they will one day return the favor. Try being 100% honest for just one day. Its not as easy as it seems. Never criticize but improve the things around you when you give your honesty.\\nSave a life every day. Ive written about this before. But my goal in life is to be a vigilante, anonymous superhero. If you can save a life a day, with strangers or with friends, then youre a hero. And heroes have all sorts of benefits in life that civilians never get or dont even know exists. If you dont believe me, save a life today and see what happens.\\nMeditate on giving. Above I said give thanks for everything there is to be thankful for. Thats one meditation. The other meditation is to think of all the giving you can do tomorrow. Go up and down this list and see what items on it you can do tomorrow.\\nGive first, then receive. It works.

       "  113: '[On my podcast, \"The James Altucher Show\" (available at itunes or Stitcher) I had the chance to interview Robert Greene, author of \"Mastery\", \"The 48 Laws of Power\" and other books.   Before I interview anyone I read all of their books. By the time I was finished reading his books I thought I was the smartest guy in the world.   Robert\\'s books are dense with great stories, information, and practical takeaways. They are unlike any other personal improvement /nonfiction books anywhere.   Only, I wasn\\'t the smartest guy in the world. I was about to talk to him.   Here\\'s a snippet of that interview. The rest is in the podcast. But this snippet is worth it.   I\\'ve spent my life trying to master whatever it was I was interested in. And most of the time I failed. But I don\\'t think the failing is as important as the trying. When you are immersed in what you love, then you change the world.   If you move on to new loves or many loves, then that\\'s fine also. You master the combination of everything you love. Then you are unique in the world.   Robert describes the process below:  JAMES ALTUCHER:  ... If you were going to give someone the five-minute summary of how to master a topic, what would be the most important factors to look at?  ROBERT GREENE:  The most important factor is chapter one in the book. You\\'re never going to master something unless you understand this  The brain is designed to learn. We learn much better when we are emotionally engaged, when we want to learn, when we are motivated, when we feel the need to learn.   Let\\'s say you have to learn French. If it\\'s in the university, if it\\'s something you have to study, you\\'re not going to learn very much in one year.  But if you\\'re in France and your girlfriend is French and you need to get a job and you need to speak French you\\'re going to learn like 20 times faster because you\\'re there and you\\'re motivated. That\\'s just how the brain works.  ALTUCHER:   So what\\'s happening there though is first you find the girl, rather than first you say to yourself, \"I want to get good at French.\" [Of course, I am missing the point entirely because there\\'s mention of \"a girl\".]  GREENE:   Yes, that could be. But the point I\\'m making is that when you\\'re motivated to learn something, you have to learn it.   You\\'re going to learn much faster.   You\\'re in France and you met this great girl. But she speaks no English, and you\\'ve got to be able to learn French in order to be able to communicate with and seduce her.  You\\'re so highly motivated, you\\'re going to learn 10 times, 20, 50 times faster than the university student back in New York or wherever you\\'re studying.  So the thing is, a lot of people go wrong. They choose a career because it\\'s about money. I have nothing against money. We all have to make a living.   But let\\'s say you go into law because that\\'s what your parents are pushing you into and other people. And it seems lucrative, but you aren\\'t personally excited by it.  You\\'re going to start tuning out. You aren\\'t going to learn very fast. After 10 years, you\\'re going to burn out.  You\\'re never going to become a master, because it takes 10,000 hours. It\\'s just a number, but let\\'s say it is pretty real. It could be real.   It could be 9,000, 11,000. You\\'re never going to have the patience. You\\'re never going to be able to put in the 10 years or more of studying something unless you really are excited about it. Unless there is some kind of personal commitment to it.  So it\\'s by far the most important thing. It\\'s that choice of the career. It doesn\\'t mean you have to know exactly what you want to be when you\\'re 21 years old and then go pursue it.   It\\'s going to be a process that might take you five or 10 years to figure out exactly what that is.  For me, it took 15 years for me to find out I should be writing books like the kind that I write. It\\'s going to take time.   But if you don\\'t make that first step  if you go into the wrong field  you\\'re never going to become a master. You\\'re never going to last long enough.  [Note: It could take many more years than 15. For me, it\\'s taken a lifetime of changing and combining careers.]  ALTUCHER:  A big question that many people have is, how do I find the thing that I\\'m passionate about?   Now you mentioned five to six years, or 15 years in your case, in terms of wanting to be a writer. But what is that process by which someone finds what they are motivated enough to be a master of?  GREENE:   Well, everybody has a different process, a different journey.   Some people knew clearly what it was when they were young. I met a woman who interviewed me. She knew that she wanted to be a writer when she was a young girl and then she got into law and it was a dead end and she hated it. She finally figured it out that she had to go back at the age of 31 to what she really loved.   So there are going to be people like that. And there are others who come to me and say, \"I have no idea what my passion is. I have no idea what I really love.\"  That\\'s troubling because that means you\\'re not listening to yourself. You\\'re not aware of your own likes and dislikes. You have been paying too much attention to what other people are saying.   So you have to go through a process now of looking at yourself. I work as a consultant. I have dealt with people, many people, who say that to me.  They say, \"I am 35. I\\'m 40. I don\\'t know what it is that I was meant to do. I really have no idea.\" OK, let\\'s go back and look at your childhood.   Let\\'s look at the things that excited you. Let\\'s look at maybe where you went wrong. Let\\'s look at the things you hate. If you hate working for a large company, if you hate politicking, you\\'re probably meant to be an entrepreneur, to be working for yourself in some level. Let\\'s look at the subjects that really excite you when you open the newspaper or go online.  It could take a couple months, it could take a year. It depends on the person.   You\\'re reconnecting to what I call a voice inside of you that you had when you were a kid, that drew you to certain activities that you have lost touch with.  I could go on for four hours about the process that I have dealt with in consulting. But it\\'s basically not going to be overnight. You\\'re not going to wake up and go, \"I should have been a doctor.\" It isn\\'t like that. It takes time, but it\\'s so worth it.  ALTUCHER:  So after that first realization that \"OK, I\\'m motivated to be a writer\" or \"I\\'m motivated to discover more uses of electricity or to be an Internet entrepreneur,\" or whatever it is what would you say is the next step?  GREENE:   First of all, if you\\'re 22 and about to enter the career world, it\\'s usually a matter of \"I like this field, the sciences\" or \"I like sports\" or whatever. A general category of things that you\\'re going to pursue.   For me, it was writing. So when I was 21, I decided I would go into journalism as a way to make a living and train myself as a writer.  You\\'re going to make a choice of something to start with that is in some way related to that field that you love. And it can be kind of general. It can just be the tech world. Or it could be a business. It doesn\\'t have to be specific. But you\\'ve got to make the right choice.  You want to think of your 20s as your apprenticeship. We don\\'t use that word anymore, and it\\'s a shame that we don\\'t. We usually all go through the school system, the education system where we are all guided and there are teachers there to help us.   Now there is nobody there to do anything for you. Maybe your parents But really, nobody is there to guide you in this new part of your life, so you\\'re CREATING YOUR OWN apprenticeship.  That apprenticeship means you\\'re going to learn skills. It\\'s NOT about making money.   If you\\'re 22 and you\\'re obsessed with making money, you\\'re never going to really make a lot of money. It\\'s a perverse law of human nature that I\\'m going to discuss.  The people who end up making the most amount of money are usually motivated by something else.   The classic example is Steve Jobs, somebody who from very early on was clearly not very interested in money. And look where he ended up. So you\\'re choosing something that appeals to you and now you\\'re open. I call it a journey.  You\\'re going to discover you like what you\\'re doing but there\\'s something better for you. It\\'s not exactly right. I knew that journalism, after three years, wasn\\'t really right for me. So I went into a different kind of writing.   Well, you\\'ll figure, \"Alright, I\\'ll go into a different line of work, a different business. Still related.\" And as you do this, you\\'re going to be accumulating skills, experiences You\\'re going to be observing people.  You\\'re going to get political social skills. And by the time you\\'re 31, you\\'re going to own the world. You\\'re going to have a lot of experience. And then you will be able to figure out how to combine everything you\\'ve learned into something great that really appeals to you.  I give examples in the book. I interviewed contemporary masters. One of those, Paul Graham, started a company called Y Combinator, which is an entrepreneur system for tech people in Silicon Valley. It\\'s worth billions of dollars, and he is the same thing.   He didn\\'t realize until he was 30 what it was that he was meant to do. But in his 20s, he had all of these amazing experiences that served as a foundation for what ended up being this great tech business that he created for Netscape back in the \\'90s.  So be prepared not to necessarily strike gold when you\\'re 25 or 26. It\\'s going to take some time. But if you think of it as your own education that you, yourself are in charge of you\\'re going to be a lot better off than people who just wander around and just choose any career.  ALTUCHER:  Robert, this is a really important message now  even from an economics point of view  because what we\\'re seeing is a disintegration of the middle class.   The middle class is formed by the conformity of the traditional school system the conformity of traditional corporatism where everybody feels that they are safe in their cubicle and they can rise up and get promotions and so on.  Whether it\\'s become masters or close to masters People now have to take charge of their economic lives. That means they have to do something they are motivated by and interested in.   Even if they don\\'t put in their 10,000 hours, they have to take control of their own lives. That\\'s why this message has become critically important in today\\'s society.  GREENE:   Yes. Take my father He worked at the same company for 40 years. They were loyal to him, and he was loyal to them.   It\\'s not that long ago that a world existed where people would work at one place and things were sort of taken care of. But that\\'s just been blown away, obliterated, probably by the Internet, by other things going on.  It might as well be the Year of the Dinosaur, and you cannot rely on the company you\\'re working for now. It will downsize you the first chance it can. Or as soon as you reach a certain age, it\\'ll replace you with somebody who is cheaper. That\\'s just the nature of it.  I\\'m not saying it\\'s good. I wish it wasn\\'t that way. But my book is about being realistic, and that\\'s just the nature of it. You\\'ve got to take control of your own life and craft and apprenticeship.  Now I want to clear up a misconception. It doesn\\'t mean that you\\'re playing chess for 10,000 hours and then you become a master of medicine or whatever. Those 10,000 hours can come from different things you have done in your life.   So for instance, this woman that I mentioned who spent her 20s in law and realized it was the wrong thing, she decided when it was finished, she would become a writer about legal issues, which was a brilliant move on her part.  All that legal experience added up to 3,000 or 4,000 hours already of writing about legal matters. And then she started getting into journalism, and now the hours are piling up.   You can take that time you think you wasted doing something else and apply it to something that really appeals to you. Suddenly, all that experience enters into practice.  I did a lot of really bad jobs myself because as a writer, I wanted a lot of experience. I did construction work, etc. And all those jobs taught me about people and about weird power situations. And about the games bosses play and all different kinds of careers.  So you can be 35, and you\\'re not going to go, \"Oh, dammit, I can\\'t do 10,000 hours, my life is screwed.\" NO, you have already probably done 5,000 hours. Now you have to find a way to apply it in a way that\\'s appropriate and personal.  ALTUCHER:  That\\'s a great way to look at it. It\\'s almost like your past Don\\'t view it as you have messed up, but how you have built these prior hours as a safety net that you can then use to build either mastery or close to mastery so that you can make that leap from the job that you\\'re not really excited about to something you\\'re more excited about.  Not everyone is a Mozart. But everyone can use the hours they have built up to build some sort of safety net for themselves, if they apply your techniques.  What is the relationship between mastery and happiness? You used the example earlier of Steve Jobs, but let\\'s throw in Mozart and Napoleon and Tesla. These people did not end up as happy people, by and large.  GREENE:   Well, I would really take issue with that. Steve Jobs was a tempestuous person who had a very obsessive personality. But I would say, judging on the biography, the last 12 years of his life must have been immensely satisfying. And it depends on your definition of happiness.  The book is called Mastery. It\\'s not called Happiness. If I wanted to write a book on happiness, I\\'d go take drugs and hang out in Peru on a hilltop or something. That\\'s not what my book is about. But I will say I make the point that everybody has creative potential.  And the worst feeling in life comes from the sense as you get older that you didn\\'t somehow tap that potential. You\\'re not expressing what you think you could have expressed and it makes a lot of people very, very unhappy.  Mozart had a great life when he finally left his father. He died young, but I would claim he was happy. I don\\'t think a lot of these people who we see as driven are necessarily unhappy. They do spend a lot of time with their work, and they are maybe obsessive.  But that kind of attention to detail  to doing what you love  brings a sense of satisfaction that maybe isn\\'t the same satisfaction that you might get from an immediate rush of going to a party.  It\\'s a different kind of happiness. It\\'s something a little more like fulfillment. And I believe that mastery is the path towards that.  I have a quote in there from da Vinci, which I love. It\\'s basically just  \"A day when you have worked hard brings a blessed sleep. A life in which you fulfilled what you\\'re doing brings a blessed death.\"  I\\'m quoting it horribly, but the idea is if you feel like you realized your potential, you almost feel like you can die a happy person.- - -[As an aside, I want to mention my podcast is all about people who have reinvented themselves and transformed their lives. Robert is an excellent example of someone who both did it and then wrote about the process. A true genius and artist.]- - -Today is the last day to pre order \"The Power Of No\" and get the three bonus gifts for all of you who helped me and my wife Claudia in this pre launch face.Make sure to get your gifts and thank you!

       "  114: '[You\\'re on the most important elevator ride of your life. You have ten seconds to pitch- the classic \"elevator pitch\".Love or Hate. Money or Despair. And you may never get this chance again. As PM Dawn says, \"I feel for you. I really do.\"There are books about this. But don\\'t waste your time. They are all garbage.I\\'ve been on both sides of this equation. I\\'ve had people pitching me.But mostly, I\\'ve been scared and desperate and afraid to ask someone to give me, want me, love me, all in the space of an elevator ride or in the time it takes one to ride an elevator.Perhaps the hardest thing for me was when I was doing my \"3am\" web series for HBO.I had to walk up to random strangers at 3 in the morning on the streets of New York and convince them within 5 seconds to spill their most intimate secrets to me rather than kill me.Not quite an elevator pitch but the same basic idea. I had a lot of practice. I probably approached over 3000 people cold.In some cases people tried to kill me. In one case I was chased. In other cases people opened up their hearts and I am infinitely grateful to them.The below ideas have worked for me in the hundreds of times I\\'ve had to be persuasive. Either in writing, or in person. In business and in friendships and in love. I hope variations on it can work for you. You decide.A) WHO ARE YOU?People want to know they are talking to a good, honest, reliable person that they can trust and perhaps even like, or love.Yes, love.They won\\'t love you by looking at your resume.You have to do method acting. Imagine what your body would feel like if they already said \"Yes\" even before you open your mouth.You would be standing up straight, smiling, palms open, ready to close the deal. You have to method act at the beginning of your pitch.If you are slouched and your head is sticking out then your brain is not as well-connected to your nervous system and you won\\'t be in \"flow\".I can drag out the science here but this is a LinkedIn post and not a peer-reviewed scientific paper for the Justice League of America.The reality is: when you\\'re slouched over, not only are you not using the full potential of your brain, but you look untrustworthy.B) RELAXThink about how you breathe when you are anxious and nervous.I will tell you how I breathe: short, shallow breaths in my upper chest.So do the reverse before a ten second pitch.Breathe deep and in your stomach. Even three deep breaths in the stomach (and when you exhale try to imagine your stomach almost hitting your back) has been shown to totally relax the mind and body.People sense this. Again, this builds trust and relaxes you.Now, even though you haven\\'t said a single word, you\\'ve probably done the two most important things for persuading someone.C) UHHH. YEAH. UHHH. MMMM-HMMM. UH-HUHI have a hard time with this. It seems natural to say, \"yup\" or \"right\" or \"uh-huh\" or whatever.But here\\'s the facts (and, again, there\\'s been studies on this): people perceive you as stupid when you do this.Just keep quiet when someone is talking.Then, when someone is done speaking, wait for two seconds before responding. They might not be done yet. And it gives you time to think of a response. If you are thinking of a response while they are talking, then you aren\\'t listening to them.People unconsciously know when you are not listening to them. Then they say No to you.D) THE FOUR U\\'sFINALLY, now we\\'re getting to the heart of the matter. THE ACTUAL NUTS AND BOLTS OF PERSUASION.By the way, I\\'ve googled \"the 4 U\\'s\" and each time I get a different set of 4. So I\\'m going to use the 4 that have worked for me the best.This is not BS. This is not a way to convince someone to do something they don\\'t want to do. This is a way for you to consolidate your vision into a sentence or two and then express it in a clear manner.This is the way to bond and connect with another person\\'s needs instead of just your own pathetic wants.You can use this in an elevator pitch, on a date, with your children, on your mother, whatever. But it works.Think about these things when talking:\\nUrgencyWhy the problem you solve is URGENT to your demographic. For example: \"I can never get a cab when it rains!\"\\nUniqueWhy is your solution unique: \"We aggregate 100s of car services into one simple app. Nobody else does this.\"\\nUsefulWhy is your solution useful to the lives of the people you plan on selling to or deliver your message to: \"We get you there on time.\"\\nUltra-SpecificThis shows there is no fluff: \"Our app knows where you are. Your credit card is pre-loaded. You hit a button and a car shows up in 4-5 minutes.\"Of course the example I give is for Uber but you can throw in any other example you want.I\\'ll throw in a fifth \"U\"\\nUser-friendlyIn other words, make it as easy as possible for someone to say \"yes\". Like a money back guarantee, for instance. Or a giveaway. Or higher equity. Or testimonials from people you both know. Etc.Oh! And before I forget, a sixth U.\\nUnquestionable ProofThis can be in the form of profits. Or some measurable statistic. Or testimonials. Or a good wing-man. Whatever it takes.\\nE) DESIREA lot of people say you have to satisfy the desires of the other person in order for them to say \"yes\".As much as we would like to think otherwise, people primarily act out of self-interest.The less they know you, the more they will act of self-interest because to do otherwise could potentially put them in danger. We all know that kids shouldn\\'t take candy from strangers.In an elevator pitch, the investor is the kid, what you are asking is the candy, and you are the stranger. So their gut reflex, unless you make the candy super-sweet, is to say \"no\".So make sure you make your candy sweeter by sprinkling in their desires.And what are their desires?\\nrecognition\\nrejuvenation\\nrelaxation\\nrelief\\nreligion\\nremuneration\\nresults\\nrevenge\\nromance\\nIf you can help them solve these URGENT problems or desires, then you they are more likely to say \"yes\" to you.I don\\'t know what you are selling, but hopefully it\\'s not to satisfy their desire for revenge. But if it is, don\\'t do anything violent.The one time I had to sell romance on an elevator I had to do three things: tell her life would be ok, make sure I knew her address and last name, and send her a teddy bear and flowers the next day.But that\\'s for another story.BUT FIRSTF) OBJECTIONSEveryone is going to have gut objections.They\\'ve been approached 1000s of times before.Do you know how many times I\\'ve been approached to have sex in an elevator?None.But probably many others have and you have to put up with their non-stop objection.I will list them and then give solutions in parentheses:\\nNo time(that\\'s ok.

The key here is to stand straight and act like someone who deserves to be listened to).\\nNo interest(you solve this by accurately expressing the urgency of the problem)\\nNo perceived difference(but you have your unique difference ready to go)\\nNo belief(offer unquestionable proof that this works)\\nNo decision(make their decision as user-friendly as possible)\\n- - -With great power comes great responsibility.Most people don\\'t have the power of persuasion.

       "  115: '[The first girl I dated after separating from my wife asked me what my net worth was on our first date.I was honest and I told her. She said, thats not enough.I asked her what her ex was worth but she said, why do people always ask that.Her ex was well known, 20 years older than her (maybe 30), and probably worth over $100 million according to the newspaper.But theres a saying (its a saying because one person has told it to me but I repeat it everywhere as if I had made it up): You never know what someone is worth until they declare bankruptcy.I felt bad about not having enough so I told her some things I was working on.None of that stuff ever works out, she said.And she was right. None of that particular stuff worked out. But I didnt know it then. I wouldnt know it for years.Another time I asked her, how come you never introduce me to your friends?And she said, Because youre too crazy.Which made a lot of sense. I do NOT introduce my crazy friends to my normal friends. One of her friends was running for Senate or Governor or something. That wouldve created a lot of problems if he was seen hanging out with a crazy person. But I couldve maybe offered to be Vice-President if he ever made it that far.I dont know.Sometimes you give a carrot but they take the whole stick.One time she said to me, my people can destroy your people.Which I doubt. My people at that time were largely zombies. In the movies you often see the Governor or the Head of the Joint Chiefs totally powerless against the Zombie army.But I couldnt tell her that and reveal my true identity.I said, Maybe. We were in a Mexican restaurant, which I considered neutral territory considering as how my DNA tests showed I have some Canadian blood in me.We broke up. Id like to think I broke up with her if it wasnt for that one conversation where she called me and said, Im not ready for you. I need time. Maybe A LOT of time.And then I broke up with her.I was in a Borders bookstore at that moment and she was at President Obamas first inauguration, and I still had a Blackberry.Those big buttons that required the slightest of pushes. We were texting. I remember typing out, bre..k and then backspacing. You know the drill. I miss my Blackberry.How things have changed.Back then just a smidgen of Chinese food could cause enlightenment. People were having orgasms over politics and the country was heading towards the Apocalypse.Sometimes I wish I could go back to those days when nothing seemed to matter except being lonely, eating hot dogs for breakfast, being scared of going broke, being forced to move rooms every 29 days by NYC law since I lived in a since shut-down hotel, and wandering around bookstores looking for women to hit on.But then I gave up.I started saying No to people who werent right for me. I started saying No to everything I didnt want to do.I started saying No to mindless meetings, mindless events, mindless people who were bad for me, mindless food or alcohol, mindless anger and regret. Mindless TV and news.I started saying No to colonoscopies and other things related to painful medical experiments. I listed all the things I could say No to and I still do.When you have a tiny tiny piece of shit in the soup it doesnt matter how much more water you pour in and how many more spices you put on top. Theres shit in the soup.I had been saying YES to the wrong things for 20 years.Within six months my life was completely different. I met Claudia. I moved out of hotels. I was working on ideas that actually made money. And I needed fewer and fewer things to make me happy. Thats the Power of No. Thats true minimalism.Every six months since then my life has changed. Even in the past few days, remarkable things have happened.When you start just saying No to the bad things, the Yes compounds every day. It compounds automatically, the way interest does in a non-US bank.When she asked me what my net worth was I couldve just said, No and got up and not wasted three months of my life. But as easy as that sounds, I didnt know how to do it.Now I do. Now Im free. I dumped the old soup. Now I can finally drink from the soup I just cooked.* * *How many times have you heard yourself saying \"yes\" to the wrong things  overwhelming requests, bad relationships, time-consuming obligations?

       "  116: '[ I hate being a slave.One might think: dont be a jerk. You werent in chains in the 1800s. That was real slavery.Ok, I hate arguing. Go away.But lets take a look at the average person.The average person works at a job. Fine, you might say, a job is a lot different from slavery. I can take a water break for instance. And sometimes go to the bathroom. And when I talk to people the same sex as me there arent even any rules governing what I can say.Great. I agree.But lets just take a look at your income and your behavior.Sure, you might say, I realize I dont get all of my income. About 40% goes to taxes.And there you would be wrong.Your true salary is the value you create for the place you work.Some percentage of it goes to your boss. He has to get paid also you know. Who do you think pays him? You do.Some percentage of your salary goes to his boss and however big the hierarchy is. I know this, having been a boss, having run a company, and having been an employee.Some percentage of your salary goes to the shareholders of the company before you even see it.And some percentage goes to the vendors of the company. Like the insurance benefits your company gives you that you most likely will never need (if you were likely to need them, then the benefits would be higher, until you no longer need that much. Thats how insurance works).And some percentage goes to employees that dont pull their weight. The 80/20 rule applies where approximately 80% dont pull their weight so any money left over from your efforts has to be used to pay them. You pay them.Finally, you have to pay for your cubicle, your office supplies, the computer on your desk, your phone, etc. If you created no extra money to pay for these things then they wouldnt exist. So this comes directly out of your salary.I call all of the above your Above The Line salary. Try to figure out what your Above The Line salary is.You can say, my company gives me the opportunity to make this above the line salary. Thats fine. But they take quite a bit. Its probably four or five times higher than your Below The Line salary. Theres better ways to get your Above the Line salary so you personally benefit from it. Most companies are very wasteful and you pay for that waste directly out of your salary.Then theres your Below-the-Line salary.40% goes to Federal and State taxes. This is already after your services have been taxed at the corporate level, now your being taxed another 40% at the personal level.Note that only salaried employees pay 40%. Nobody else does.The richest Americans pay less than 15% on average on gains in their net worth. Thats because salaried employees are slaves and have the least political power.Another 5-8% goes to taxes on everything you consume. Now we are almost at 50%.Then, like most Americans, you have a mortgage. Maybe this another 10-20% of your salary. Your company likes you to own your house because you are less likely to quit (you need the money to pay the mortgage) and you are less likely to move (youre not mobile).Then student loans you are paying off. For the first time ever, greater than 50% of the unemployed have college degrees. So it\\'s pretty scary. You got this degree because (in part) you thought it would get you a job. But it didnt guarantee anything and now you have to pay for it. Some percentage of your salary is sliced off every month to pay for that degree.Then some portion of your salary goes towards health, upkeep of your relationships (they always cost money. This is not being cynical. Just reality), your transportation to your job (they force you to pay for the honor of transporting yourself to your slavequarters).How much goes to you? You wake up before dawn. You travel. You work hard. You come home late. Youre feeling stuck. Youre mildly depressed and may take medication for this. And you have trouble sleeping and digesting.Shouldnt you get paid more?As it stands, between above the line and below the line expenses taken out of your salary, you are probably left with 1/10 of your salary. In other words, you could be making ten times as much money if you started to un-slave yourself.Then theres behavior. I can do whatever I want, I used to say. In fact, when i was at a job I felt free. I could sneak out at 4pm. I could take lots of breaks. Vacations were big.But did you look at the manual?Theres a big manual. And sometimes there are workshops to go over the manual.Like you cant talk to people of the opposite sex in certain ways. They teach you what are good ways to talk to people of the opposite sex.You cant talk to your boss a certain way. Because for all of your slavery, all he has to say is, youre fired and all of that goes away.You cant wear what you want. Most office situations have a uniform, either explicit or implicit.You cant be friends with who you want. Youre mostly just friends with the people you spend your day with  the other slaves. When they go away you never talk to them again.You cant be creative when inspiration hits. Anything done on equipment owned by the company is intellectual property owned by the company. Good luck arguing with that one.You cant have an office romance even though those are the only women you know. For one thing you might get fired. And all of your emails can be read by human resources. My closest friend when I was at HBO was fired when his office romance went awry and all of his emails were read by his boss.If you want more money, you have to beg for it. There are entire seminars created just to teach people how to ask for 5% more money at work. People are scared to death to Ask.And by the time you get home to have real social interactions, youre tired and bitter and angry at work.I know Im doing a little bit of projecting here. This was my personal experience about having a job.I felt like a slave. I hated it. Maybe a lot of people like it. But I am just doing the math. The Above the Line salary is real and comes straight out of your pocket before you even knew that money was there.Most people can make 5-10x more by being creative and figuring out how to offer services on their own without the company taking out all of the Above the Line expenses. And then there are ways to limit the Below the Line expenses.Money wont solve all of your problems, but it will solve your money problems. Dont let them take your money so they can keep you in slavery.You want to own your time. Own your work. Own the value you create for others. Protect yourself so nobody can fire you. Not be owned by the bank or the government. Not be owned by your relationships. Own your thoughts.I cant just quit my job! you might say.And I agree with this. Dont quit.So many people read self-help books to help them deal with what they think are the realities of work. Self-help books are often self-hurt books because they try to keep you happy about being enslaved.For instance, show compassion to the people who hurt you many of them say. This might be good advice. But Id rather show compassion to the people who love me.Start to be an explorer. We live in a 15 trillion dollar economy. You helped create it. Just like slaves and death and misery helped create the beautiful pyramids.But 90% of what you create is taken from you.Start to explore what parts you can take back. Work every day on ideas. List every interest youve had since you were a kid. List every business or job that can be started from that interest. Read every day about your interests.Dont be angry at the people at work, even your boss. They are all slaves also. You need to break free from them. Dont indulge your free thoughts on the other slaves with their Rolex shackles.Study the lives of people who arent slaves. What did they do? Study the people online who seem to have broke free. What are they doing? Keep working on the idea muscle.I did this. And in six months my life changed completely. Sometimes for the worse. Much worse. I didnt know what I was doing and sometimes I ended up on the floor, depressed and suicidal.Sometimes freedom is very scary. Its outside of the jail cell (comfort zone) you created for yourself.But every six months since then my life has changed completely. My life is completely different than it was even six months ago.Sixteen years ago I had a boss yell at me. Hes a good guy and has since broken free himself. But one time he yelled at me and I couldnt yell back or I would risk being fired. I felt like crying. Actually, I did cry.So I went to the library on 41st Street and 5th Avenue. I found a science fiction book I read once before as a kid. It had that cellophane wrapping and a library card in it. And it had that smell when you open the pages.I went three or four levels down, to my private bathroom in the library. My sanctum sanctorum.And I sat there and I read about a man who lived forever and was happy. And the world disappeared and for a brief moment I was no longer a slave.From that moment on I plotted my escape. And every day since, I figure out new ways to escape, new ways to be free. New ways to own my world.- - - - -Don\\'t miss out on the free gifts that come with pre-ordering my book \"The Power of No\" until July 15th. (Photo by Michiel)]',\n",
       "  117: '[I was a day trader for many years, and it almost killed me.I made money by making profits on my own money and also taking a percentage of the profits for the people I traded for. I traded up to $40 million or $50 million a day at my peak. I did this from 2001 to 2004.I learned about day trading but I also learned a lot about myself and what I was good at, what I was horrible at, and what I was psychotic at. Things that had nothing to do with day trading.Day trading is the best job in the world on the days you make money. You make a trade, then maybe 20 minutes later you are out of the trade with a profit, and for the rest of the day you think about how much money you made.Its the worst job in the world on a bad day. I would make a trade, it would go against me, and then I wanted my heart to stop so my blood would stop thumping so loudly.I did it for years, though, because I was unemployable in every other way.Heres what I learned. All of these lessons I will certainly use today, many years after I stopped day trading.A) You cant predict the future. Everyone thinks they can. But they cant.This applies not just to trading but everything. You could be married for 10 years and the next thing you know you are divorced and you would not have predicted that.You could be healthy all your life and drink your vegetables and exercise and reduce stress, and a year later you could be dead from cancer.Youd have much less stress if you let go of trying to predict the future.You can always seek to increase the odds in your favor. If I dont jump off bridges, for instance, its more likely Ill be alive a year from now. But certainly a path to unhappiness is thinking the future can be predicted and controlled.B) Hope is not a strategy.If you get to the point where you hope you dont get ruined, then you did something wrong beforehand.For instance, if you plan a wedding outside and you dont have a backup plan in case it rains, then you probably mis-planned your wedding, unless you are getting married in a desert.Hoping is not a bad thing. I hope that every day my life goes perfectly.But if hoping is the only thing Im relying on, then it means I didnt really look at all the possible outcomes of something that was important to me.C) Uncertainty is your best friend.A hundred percent of opportunities in life are created because people are uncertain about almost everything in their lives.We are constantly trying to close the enormous gap between the things we are certain about and the things we are uncertain about, and almost every invention, product, Internet service, book, whatever has been created to help us close that gap.Sometimes this is hard. If your husband betrays and leaves you, you often feel like crawling on the floor and burning all the self-help books. They all lied.Its hard to feel in the now or to positive think when life feels like its over. Ive tried. For me its too hard.But at the very least you can say help me. You can say it to your close friends. You can say it something inside of yourself.Help me is the most powerful, and most forgotten, prayer.D) Taking risks versus reducing risk. Some people take too many risks and they go bankrupt. This happened to me. And sometimes people are too cautious and dont take enough risks.When I first started day trading, I was so afraid of risk that if I had a small profit, Id end the trade. But then I would take big losses and that would wipe out all my profits.The key is that you can take larger and larger risks if you work on better and better ways to deal with those risks.For instance, I might be able to risk marrying someone if I know she is not a hard-core drug addict who regularly betrays the people she is close to.I can risk driving without a license if I always stay below the speed limit (I know this is a stupid risk, but still). Once you have a method of reducing risks, its easier to make trades or decisions about anything.E) Diversification.Often I get emails, I really want ONE job but they dont seem to want me and now Im miserable. How can I get that job?Well you cant.And youre going to be unhappy. You cant wish yourself a job.When I was raising money to day trade, I probably contacted over 1,000 people. When I was starting an Internet business I started over a dozen Internet businesses and watched all of them fail but one. When I was trying to sell my Internet business I contacted over a dozen companies (although Google broke my heart  damn you Google!).When I wanted to get married, I went on lots of dates. Claudias approach was even smarter  she wouldnt waste time with dinners. She would only go to tea with guys. Within the first 20 seconds you know if you are attracted. So keep it to a tea.F) Say no.In day trading, if something is not working out, even if your heart wants it to work out, you have to say No and cut your losses.If a business relationship is not working out, dont put more energy and time into it.There is a cognitive bias called committment bias. We think because weve already put time and energy (or money) into something that we have to stick with it. But this is just a mental bias. Say no to it.You have to decide every moment if this is the situation you want to be in.Just because you were in the situation a moment ago, or yesterday, or for 10 years, doesnt mean the situation is right for you anymore.G) Health.Day trading pulls everything out of you. It sucks the soul out of your body, blends it up, and then explodes. It doesnt turn into a nice smoothie. It explodes.So you have to take care of yourself. If you dont sleep enough, if you dont eat well, exercise, be around positive people, be grateful for what you have, blah blah blah, you will lose all of your money and go bankrupt.And obviously, this applies to everything else in life. Every day, what small thing can you do to become a slightly better you?The reason we get so attracted to safe cubicle jobs is that the pain is more subtle and sneaks up on us. Its not the blender-drama of day trading so the need for health on a daily basis doesnt seem as important. But it is.H) Laughter. The only way to survive is to laugh. Theres that saying: Man makes plans but God laughs. Well, you might as well be on the same side as God.I) This is crazy means youre crazy.Ive seen it a million times. Guy makes a trade. The market goes against him. He says this is crazy and puts more money into the trade. And then he loses all his money and goes crazy. Ive had to talk people off the ledge or tell them to put the gun down.The market is never crazy. The world is never crazy. And I will go so far as to say that your girlfriend who just lied to you about where she spent the night is not crazy.I only care about you. And youre effin crazy if you thought the world was going to line up any other way than the way it lined up.Tough on you.I know when I feel like, ugh, this situation is insane that the first place I need to look is at me.I am insane.J) It doesnt matter if a trade (or a day, or a life) is good or bad. Good and bad days happen. But life is about a billion little moments that add up to all the things around you. If you let one of those moments have too much control then you are bound to be mostly miserable.I was mostly miserable during the period I was day trading. I let that aspect of my life take control. So I stopped focusing on being a good husband, a good father, a good friend, a good anything.All of my other constituencies went to hell.I would have nightmares. I would lose sleep. I would wake up many mornings and go to the church across the street so I could be by myself and pray. What would I pray? Jesus, please make the markets go in my direction today.Im Jewish. Nobody answered my prayers.K) Its never about the money.Every day I get emails like, Can you show me how to day trade?NO!I know a thousand day traders and only two that wont go bankrupt. So what makes anyone think they will have an edge? How many people listen to me?Zero.How come?Because people are sick of their lives, their relationships, their jobs, and all the lies that have been told to them ever since they learned how to walk.They want freedom from the BS.I get it.Day trading is the dream. You can make enough money to not care. To do it from anywhere. To be happy.It wont work. But people dont want to believe it. Most people think they have that one special something that will make it work for them.And its true  they do have that one special something. But you cant get there by day trading first. You can skip right to the being happy part. You can skip right to being free.But we never learned that. We were taught we had to do something first to earn freedom. We were taught that suffering was the currency to buy happiness.Okay, go do it. Then cry about it. Then get scared. Then curse the craziness. Then cry more. None of that will make you happy.Then read this blog post again. Not because it will make you happy. But because I like when people read my posts.And laugh.- - - - - - - - - -Don\\'t miss out on the free gifts that come with pre-ordering my book \"The Power of No\" until July 15th.

       "  118: \"[Im really stupid. I can tell you in advance. I think at heart, if I work at it, I can be smart. But at the moment Im largely an idiot. I feel I have the right knowledge but I let a lot of stuff get in the way. You know: stuff. Worries, guilt, paranoia, grudges, resentment. Like, for instance: I resent the people who resent me. I think they resent me for no reason. So now I resent them. What a circle-jerk!I used to think when I added stuff to my brain Id get smarter. But this is not true. For instance, if I look up when Charlemagne was born Id just add a fact to my head which I will forget tomorrow. This wont make me smarter. Subtraction, and not Addition, is what makes the window to the brain more clear, wipes away the smudges, opens the drapes.One example: the day I lost the deal to do Tupacs website, I had a chess lesson afterwards. I couldnt play at all. It was like I didnt even know the rules. My instructor said, whats wrong with you today? But I was ashamed. And angry at myself. So my intelligence went way down. Like 80% down.So heres my great list.1) Paranoia. I figure on the moments when you are paranoid (Is she cheating? Is he stealing? Are they talking about me? Will they sue me? Etc.) you lose about 30-50% of your intelligence. Thats a big chunk. For me, its because I cant think of anything else. I would circle her house until the lights were on and then Id knock on the door. Or I would go to his office and not leave until he showed up. Paranoia will destroy you.2) Resentment. Someone wrote about me a year ago. I hold a grudge. He was a friend, then wrote the worst crap about me. What a jerk. But when I think about it, I figure I lose about 20% of my intelligence. Particularly if the thoughts involve revenge. Then maybe 30% of my intelligence.3) Regret. Ive written about it a billion times. I lost a lot of money in 2000-2001. I regret it. Or, I should say, I regretted it. I dont anymore. How come? Because I saw that regret was taking at least 60% of my intelligence away. I couldnt afford 60%. 2% I could afford. Not 60%. I didnt start coming up with ideas for new businesses until the regret went away.4) Perfectionism. When I was running a fund I never wanted to have a down month. Id be afraid to talk to my investors then. One guy, who is still a good friend (I spoke with him today even) said, listen, if youre going to be a fund manager you have to be able to talk to people when you have a down month.But I was ashamed. When I lost my house, I moved 70 miles away. I didnt want to run into anyone. I felt shame. When I write a blog post I think is weak, I might take it down before too many see it. Im ashamed of it. I want to win the Nobel Prize for blog writing. Or at least 10,000 Facebook likes. But I cant control that. Im imperfect. The shame of imperfectionism takes at least 20% of my intelligence away. Because people sense and appreciate honesty and honesty about imperfections, believe it or not, creates enormous opportunities. Ive seen it happen in my own life.5) Control. I want to control everything around me. But sometimes things are bad and theres nothing you can do about it. Sometimes you have to surrender and say, this is bad now but good things will happen later. Then a great weight lifts off your shoulders.You know why they always say a great weight lifts off your shoulders? because thats where your brain is. And your brain is heavy. It rests on your shoulders. When stuff is weighing it down you lose about 10-20% of your intelligence. Give up control and get smarter. A simple example: you are late for a meeting but theres traffic. You can think God damn this traffic. Why am I always in traffic? Or you can be thinking about something smart: like how good bacon tastes. Can I make a better bacon? Or how would I start a helicopter airline to take me from one side of the city to the other. These seem like dumb thoughts. But they are much better than God damn this traffic!6) Guilt. A good friend of mine wrote me recently. Every day when I wake up I tell myself: dont return emails until you read, then write. But then sometimes I have other things to do. Meetings. Or BS stuff. Or eating. I say, okay, I will return that email later. And then when later comes I feel bad that I havent returned his email earlier. Then at 3:00 am I turn over and say to Claudia, I didnt return that email. She says Urghushghshemmmm which was not the answer I was looking for. Then I dont sleep as much. Then I feel guilty. That takes away about 10% of my intelligence right there.7) Worst Case Scenario. Lets say I lose $1000 in the stock market once every day. Sometimes I think to myself, holy shit, if I lose that amount every day for the next. And it gets worse and worse. My worst case scenarios has my children begging for food on the harsh streets of Bangalore. Ive spent at least a year of my life, when you add it up, thinking of the worst case scenario. Even though the worst case scenario HAS NEVER HAPPENED. Or if it does happen, it was never as bad as I thought it would be. I have a scarcity complex. If I didnt have that then Id have an abundance complex. And I firmly believe, abundance follows an abundance complex. So Im smarter (and wealthier) when I give up that scarcity complex.8) Talking. Claudia wanted to say something important to me. But I spoke instead. I imparted my great wisdom on her before she could get a word out. Finally, she forgot what she was going to say. Probably because my words were so wise they were like the Bible. Or like Roberts Rules of Order. Or Strunk &amp; White. Thats how wise I am. STRUNK AND WHITE! Extra talking probably takes away at least 15% of my intelligence. Because I couldve been listening and learning. Or reading about grammar. Or not getting into an accident when talking on the phone. Sometimes we just have to Shut Up! 9) Excuses. Everyone says, I cant. I cant be a medical professional unless I go to medical school. I cant be a movie maker unless I raise $10 million to make a movie. I cant marry a super model because Im ugly. I cant I cant I cant. For every cant  you should send me $10. I can do all those things. Particularly if I have your $10.Ugh, 9 things. I cant even make this a ten lister as we pros call them in the blog biz. Can someone come up with a tenth for me please?By the way, just notice when these things come up. Its not like youre going to get cured of paranoia. But notice when it appears. Water withers the rock away. Every time you notice, the window clears a tiny bit. A smudge is gone. You get a glimpse of the light outside.You get a tiny bit smarter. Maybe later you have to look for the deeper emotional reasons for why you feel the way you do. And there are a lot of reasons. Everyone couldve made fun of your acne in junior high school and now you want to be loved by everyone (err, maybe that happened to me). But right now, this second, just dont get hit by a car when you cross the street.You can say, hey, wait a second! All of those things equal up to more than 100%! Well, what can I say? Youre smarter than me.- - - - -Listen to my podcast interview with Mark Cuban.

       "  119: '[I pitched a TV show and they loved it. I was going to mike up tables in a restaurant and tape record dates. I would know the woman (she was beautiful, funny, etc) and the guy would not know he was being videotaped.We created a reel (two dates). One guy admitted in the middle of the date he was confused about whether or not he was gay. Another guy got a call from his wife in the middle of the date. Great stuff. Great TV as they say in the Biz.I pitched it to Dave Bartolis who worked at HBO Independent Productions. They loved it. He was going to call me back the next day. He didnt. Or the day after that. I would call his office. His secretary would say he was on the other line. I can hold. Oh, hell call you right back.He didnt.Finally I called his home number. Oh, uh, we LOVE the idea.

It would fit right in with their company. Their company was named Google. I wont get into it. They didnt call back. Same as above. I didnt call anyone at home this time. I had gotten better. But I had wet dreams at night. And then I would cry as the sun rose.Why wouldnt they call me back?And then a girl. We were apart for a vacation. She was going out to dinner with her ex. Shell call me AS SOON AS she gets back. I fall asleep. At 3am I wake up and realized I never got a call. So I call. No answer. Why didnt she call me back? Where is she? Two months later she was pregnant. Who was the father?Sometimes I hate the phone, emails, Facebook, Twitter, the call back. Why am I sitting here. Waiting. Dont they realize Im waiting? Dont they want to talk to me: give me money, love, sex, fortune, fame, even just a little respect or generosity? You would give me those things. Wont you?A) Expand your alternative ideas. When you are waiting for ONE person on ONE idea, youre screwed. You are in a perpetual state of I need this or I die. So we need to prevent you from dying. Heres the surgery you must perform. Find at least one more idea you are excited about. There was one time I was raising a fund. People werent calling back. I decided, ok, time to focus on creating a business of skin care products. Eventually, I raised the fund.B) Expand your list of people to call.  Why did I just call HBO Independent Productions? Why didnt I call Showtime? Or Comedy Central. I knew all the people. EVERYONE wouldve said. I LOVE THIS at the same time. This is the key to getting people to call you back. Even if nobody individually plans on calling you back, if everyone is saying, I LOVE THIS, someone will call you back.C) Just DO it. I had two dates in the can. They were perfect. We did a third date. The guy wouldnt sign the release form unless the girl, my friend, would have sex with him. Another perfect date in the can. Why did I need HBO to pick me? PICK YOURSELF! I couldve just done fifteen of those dates and I wouldve had a perfect documentary. Or a complete pilot that I did myself without the help of any studio. I no longer pitch books to publishers who might sit on them for months. I PICK MYSELF. I no longer wait for buyers to come knocking on my doors for companies. I make the calls and SELL my company. And I DUMPED any girl who I was suspicious of.D) Repeat: infinite patience brings immediate results.\" This is a saying from something. Claudia told me. So I dont want to plagiarize. Even though I am right now. But, truly, deep inside, I dont, because I wish it were my original quote.I cannot even begin to tell you how amazing this quote is. Every time I think I need ONE thing to happen to make me happy, I repeat the above quote and follow some of the ideas below to take my mind off of the ONE thing and its amazing the result. Something else happens and its usually better.Einstein discovered that time is relative. My guess is, he was waiting for a girl to call him back when he made this discovery. Because everyone does run on a different schedule. One guy might say, Ill call you back tomorrow or so and that might mean two weeks for him and it might mean fifteen minutes for you. And time expands exponentially the more ideas, the more choices, and the more you are capable of PICKING YOURSELF and doing also the below items. Infinite patience then does, surprisingly, produces IMMEDIATE results. I cant describe further. You have to try it. Its magic.E) Work out or have sex. When you have a great meeting or phone call or date and you are now waiting for a follow up, its really similar to your body being mugged. When you are mugged the adrenalin inside of you spikes up to unheard of levels. Its the Fight or Flight syndrome. You MUST fight or your MUST flee.Instead... you are sitting, immobile, by the phone. But the adrenalin is still there, building up, unsure why you are not fighting or fleeing. Then you die. That would suck pretty bad just because somebody didnt call you back.So you have to get your body moving. Working out, sweating, sex  release all the adrenalin, get the endorphins or domamine or whatever the latest hormone they are calling it, running through your body to fight the adrenalin.F) Clean. Yeah, take a shower. You stink. Youve been sitting by that phone for days. Scrub with one of those hard brushes that take the dead cells off your skin and really open up your pores. Then turn the shower on super hot so you start to sweat it all out. All the pain, all of the Why didnt she call back that has buried itself into the molecules in your arms, legs, face, head.And then clean your house. It looks like shit in here. This is a reflection of what your brain looks like. Clean it all up.Then throw stuff out. Why are you even keeping all these extra books around that you read ten years ago. Are you ever going to read The Hobbit ever again for the rest of your life? And yet, every time youve moved since high school, youve carried that book with you. But its a special edition with drawings! Throw it out!Then clean your expenses. Do you really need to buy that extra book, t-shirt, movie, taxicab, hot dog, glass of wine? Clean everything. Theres a saying that all the cells in your body change every seven years. This may or may not be true. I have no idea. Everyone says it. But its also true about mental cells, emotional cells, spiritual cells. In fact, those might change every few months. Make sure the new cells have a fresh clean home to come to. Youre disgusting, sitting there by the phone.Clean up.G) Dont Guess. Well, its the holiday season so they must be busy to call but they will call right afterwards. Or, this is good news. It probably means they are running it up to their board and getting final approvals. Or, she got home early but didnt want to wake me. She knows I like to go to sleep early. Dont try to guess what they are doing or why they are not calling back.I have this big problem. Im obsessive. Combined with being a chess player. I look down every angle. Over and over. I picture everything ten moves ahead as to why they are not calling back. And I usually find two variations: the one that works best for me and the one that works the worst for me. And I obsess on both.What a waste of time. Dont guess. 99 times out of 100 you are wrong. And the one time you are right out of the 100 its for the wrong reasons and, by the way, its your worst case scenario. Congrats on being right.H) Dont Judge. When I was going to start writing for thestreet.com, Jim Cramer was excited about my ideas and introduced me to Dave Morrow (R.I.P.) who was editor in chief. Jim said, use this guy! to Dave about me. I would call Dave and call him and call him and he would never call back or he would say, Ill call back tomorrow. What a godamn drag!Finally I said to a friend of mine, thats it! I dont even want to write for a company that treats people like this.And he said, you need to calm the fuck down. Once you start writing for them youll never even deal with this Dave character anymore. And then youll be writing for thestreet.com. It will be great for you.And eventually Dave did call back, I started writing, I sold Stockpickr to them, and I hardly ever dealt with Dave (R.I.P.) which leads to an important corollary but Ill make it a separate point:I) Life is Short. They didnt call back. They never will. Youll call them and argue with them and plead with them and beg with them. The baby will be aborted. The company wont get bought or sold. The deal will never be signed. The money wont be raised. The TV show wont get done.But in 60-80 years well all be dead. Tiny dots. On a tiny planet. Remember back to the days before the Big Bang happened. When we were all just happy being pre-nothing, before information even existed. Well, that will happen again. See you then, buddy.J) Dont be afraid. Youre sitting by the phone, sweating. Is she having sex with someone else? Are they never going to buy my company? Its Friday afternoon, am I really going to have to wait until Monday when they said they would call back by the end of the week with the decision?Dont be afraid my poor little child. Youre waiting by the phone because you had the brush with love, the first kiss, the smile, the intent, the ambition, the ideas, the ability to network and connect, the assets to sell, the clients to introduce, the companies to build.I want to hold you and hug you. You dont need the call back to be happy. You dont need to be scared. Everything that ever will happen to you starts from just a seed. Plant more seeds.Be fruitful and multiply.(Photo by David Blaikie)]',\n",
       "  120: '[I disgust myself. When I was six I used to make fun of one kid for being heavier than me. When I was seven I made fun of a kid for being Chinese. He was the only Chinese kid in the neighborhood. I was a seven year old racist. He was so upset the principal had to talk to me. The punishment  we had to ride with each other on the bus every day. He was more upset than me about this.When I was nine I was caught shoplifting football cards. This after a successful crime career lasting for about a year where I had stolen everything from candy to Charlie Brown books to Mad books to baseball cards. My parents were so angry they cancelled my birthday party that was coming up. Then they never let me have one again. I still dont have birthday parties. Because I stole a football card.(worth it)I did lots of things. Things much later. Ugh. I can hardly think of it. The things that I would do. Im like a psychopath or sociopath when I really get down to it. Worst of all, I go to the bathroom. Ive never seen a more disgusting thing than my own human body going to the bathroom. Ugh.Google: I need to talk to you about this! You are making a car that drives without a driver. You are making glasses that wire my brain right into the Internet. Why the hell cant you make it so I dont have to shit. Like, cant I wear glasses that do photosynthesis from the sun and turn into nutrition for my body. Nutrition with no waste. Why, for everything I eat, do I have to generate waste? This is almost proof that Satan exists.And even worse, some of the waste gets stuck. If youre not yet my age (44) youll start to know what Im talking about. It gets stuck forever. Ive switched diets recently. No carbs. No processes sugars. Not even gluten-free stuff, which is all a scam. And, I have to say, the quality of what comes out of me has become much better. Nor do I feel as stuffed.So, ok, glass half full. Right?Let me tell you the real bad news, although it wont seem that way. Our alien ancestors who created us also created simple tools (call them triggers if you will) so that we can reprogram our bodies to be happy. What does happy mean? It means various chemicals get manipulated throughout the body. Cortisol levels go down. Cortisol is the fight or flight hormone. So, like, when you are sitting at your desk staring at a computer screen and you are worried your boss is going to yell at you, your cortisol levels are going through the roof.In other words, your body wants to do what it wouldve done 20,000 years ago (a micro-second in our evolutionary history) and basically run as fast as possible or physically destroy whatever is scaring you. Fight OR flight. Note the OR. There really isnt an in-between that says, dont move and simply stare at your computer screen while you are simmering in unrequited anger and frustration. That wasnt part of the evolutionary plan. Thats what the neanderthals did probably. And look at what happened to them. Theyre dead. Every last one of them.So what do you do? In our modern day and age. You sit there, you stare at the computer screen, you maybe type some words but then your brain is distracted. You cant think. Your cortisol is through the roof and nothing is working it off. Thats really horrible. The cortisol needs to be worked off. Or else. You are royally *******. You can get cancer, heart disease, strokes, Alzheimer, the whole works.And if you are like me, if you are like most people, then chances are this is happening to you every day. Heres what happens. The vagus nerve stretches from your brain to your stomach and hits every organ along the way (almost). It gets inflamed when your cortisol levels are too high for too long. The vagus nerve basically causes every disease known to mankind. High stress inflames it, as does bad food, smoking, etc. You get the drift.What suppresses the inflammation?Another hormone that the body is more than happy to release. Oxytocin. Oxytocin performs two very important functions that allow the human race to continue. But these functions have various beneficial side effects.1) Oxytocin is released when you have an orgasm. For men, interestingly, it is only released when you have an orgasm with someone you love.2) Oxytocin is released when a woman is in labor. It helps the cervix stress so its in less pain. Its released for women, that is. For men, when the female cervix starts to expand its the beginning of about nine years of agony.Basically, Oxytocin is the hormone that is there at the critical moments of life creation. Its the life hormone. It also helps reduce cortisol levels (you know that feeling of relaxation you get after sex) and it reduces inflammation of the vagus nerve. (I sort of like that word: vagus. Its both vague and vaginal).So Im not going to point to all the research. You can google it with your glasses. But basically, theres various ways you can trick the body into releasing oxytocin. The benefits are simple: you feel better and you will live longer and you will reduce stress and be happier.Here are ten ways:\\nGive money away. Turns out that showing compassion in a visceral way like giving money is linked to higher levels of oxytocin. My guess is that giving to charity is not the way to do it. I prefer my method of being a superhero that I write about in this post.\\nHugging someone. Touching and hugging release oxytocin with hugging more powerful than touching and hugging someone you love even better than normal hugging. So a hug is better than a handshake. But almost as good as hugging is imagining yourself being hugged or cuddled by someone you love. Huh. Its really funny how the brain does that.\\nUsing Facebook. I like to browse my Facebook timeline and occasionally Like a photograph that a random friend from 30 years ago posted. I would never in a Million years call that friend and say, that was a real cute photo of your baby that you posted. But liking the photo is my way of connecting with someone that I have felt close to at some point in my life, even if it was only because her locker was next to mine in junior high school. Guess what, using social media in this way turns out to release oxytocin. You know you feel good when you do it. Do it more. IN particular, facebook like all of my blog posts. [The funny thing is, someone has actually done this scientific research and demonstrated it. Not the part about liking my blog posts but about facebook in general. Although liking my blog posts will certainly release Oxytocin. You can start now if you want.]\\nLaughter. I will tell you my pre-date secret. In the brief period when I was single in between separation and re-marriage I had a technique before every date. I would watch either Michael Cera doing comedy or Louis CK doing standup. This would get me laughing, make my oxytocin hormones go on fire, and then Id go right into the date, with all my sex hormones raging. Plus. I would be temporarily funnier, with a half-life of about two hours. I knew after four hours I would be boring again so the date would have to be over by then. I do this before talks also.\\nTake a walk. Note: I didnt say take a run. Running is great for reducing the metabolism but so is eating better. Else, for me at least, running is really hard. I hate it. But I love to walk. Walk in the sun. The sun is a nutrient. And a half hour wont kill you, despite what global warming people say. Walking outside, as you might guess, is statistically correlated with higher levels of oxytocin. Well, you say, I cant walk. I have meetings all day. If you can, try to take a walking meeting. This helps you bond more with the person you are meeting with, and you might even have an adventure along the way (guess what  scientific research shows that having an adventure with someone also releases oxytocin. I guess because then you know when you are chasing wolves with someone then you will feel safer). The last time I had a walking meeting with a friend, a guy started yelling me from a car and I challenged him (with a smile on my face) to a fight. My friend had to drag me away while the guy was parking his car and getting ready to kill me. It was fun. It was an adventure. I felt thrilled. Several months later, I had a walking meeting with that same friend just yesterday.\\nShoot guns. Call up a friend right now. Make an appointment at a gun gallery. And shoot guns. I dont know what to tell you. This releases oxytocin also.\\nCall someone. Its good to talk to a friend. I dont have a lot of friends. I have about three people on my call list. Maybe four if I stretch it. Maybe five. I dont know. Maybe 50. I like a lot of people but Im too shy to call them. But maybe I should. And just chat for a few minutes. Like we all used to do when we were kids. Hey, how are you doing? Whats up? This feels good. Its like a vocal hug with someone we like. Vocally hug people today.\\nBeing trusted. This is hard. You cant force people to trust you. And trusting someone doesnt release oxytocin. But being trusted does. So live your life in such a way that more and more people will trust you. Guess what: you will be viewed in a more charismatic way if people trust you than if people dont trust you. Why not try this? How can you be more trusted. Oh my god, why so many questions today? My hands are already tired. Im about 1497 words already.\\nListening to soothing music. Just lying down and listening to music releases oxytocin. Thats why women in labor are encouraged to listen to soothing music. Thats why people having sex listen to soothing music. I dont even really know what soothing music means. I keep thinking of the 90s rap group PM Dawn. But Im sure there are better examples (Spandau Ballet?).\\nTrust me when I say this: here is my Oxytocin-rich meal: eggs, mixed with bananas, with pepper. Each ingredient known to release high levels of oxytocin. So why not eat them all together: something sweet, something savory, something spicy, a fruit, some protein, its all good. Eat a big plate of that and nothing else. BAM! You are off for the day on an oxytocin spurt.And finally:\\nDeep breathing. When the vagus nerve is inflamed your breathing becomes more shallow. Its fight or flight time! You are panicking. Your breath becomes quick. Stop it! Breathe deep. Let me tell you something: most people think yoga is all those exercises where people are standing upside down and doing weird things. In the Yoga Sutras, written in 300 BC, there are 195 lines divided into four chapters. In all those lines ONLY ONE LINE refers to physical exercise. It basically says, be able sit up straight. Thats it. Thats the only reference in the Yoga Sutras to physical exercise. Just as important is an area of yoga called pranayama which has to do with deep breathing.Basically, yoga measures a lifespan in the number of breaths you take. A dog pants fast and dies young. A turtle breathes slow and lives to over 100. Pranayama is the art of breathing slower and slower And using your cavities in your bodies other than your chest cavity to hold your breath (i.e. your abdomen, for instance). You dont have to be a pranayama expert. I dont want to be one. But the simplest exercise is to sit there and hold your breath for 8 seconds, breath out for 8 seconds, breathe in for 8 seconds, hold, etc. Do that for ten minutes a day. They didnt say this in 300 BC but your oxytocin comes out to play during these moments. I could put links to all the scientific research on these things. But its worth googling to check out if you dont believe me.\\n- - -This is all good and bad news. The good news is that there is a chemical in your brain that when released, makes you feel good for up to two weeks. And if a lot of it is released you either feel like you are having an orgasm for two weeks or, I dont know, like your cervix is being expanded for two weeks. I have no idea on that one.The bad news is exactly the same. A CHEMICAL will make you feel good for two weeks. In other words, our basic human bodies are no better than Pavlovian dogs  triggered to salivate when the right stimuli hits our 200,000 year old evolutionary brains. Were no better than the dogs. No better than the jellyfish that crawled out of the bottom of the ocean and then formed tentacles, then arms, then brains.Forget all self-help. Its all garbage. Its all about this one silly chemical. The news lately is all about Higgs-Boson being the god particle. Well, oxytocin is the god hormone.That said, Ill do all of the above. I need my body functioning. I need to get rid of mental waste and physical waste and emotional waste. Why not?But at the end of the day its spiritual waste that Im after. And how do you get that? How do you get to that peculiar desire of trying to have no desires. Because when you expect nothing, you have the immense satisfaction of getting everything you want.How do you get there?Its not Oxytocin. I wont be fooled into believing it. But if it makes me shit out my mental and emotional waste better then sign me up. Being happy is a good start. But oxyocin is just the flower. And you cant see the flower without the light. The goal is to be the light.(OJ Simpson Photo credit: Vintage Football Card Gallery; Vagus nerve image: University of Toronto Wikidot)]',\n",

       "  122: '[After losing over one million a week, cash, for the entire summer of 2000, I was forced to sell my apartment. So one day in 2002, all the boxes were packed, the apartment was empty. We had two moving trucks waiting downstairs to move us an hour north of the city. It was like an exile. My self-esteem was gone, my apartment was gone, I hadnt slept a full night in almost three years, and other things I cant even talk about. My ex-wife, my two toddler girls, and Lynne, a close family friend who was helping us move, were taking one last look around. Oh. My. God, Lynne said. This is really it.Its been a decade and a lot has happened, good and bad (mostly good). Someone asked me the question, whats it feel like to be rich? I figured Id answer based on my pre-2000 experiences. Ill save 2000-2010 for another time.A lot of people would answer with I was able to buy this, or that, or this and that. Money was never about that for me, then or now. Theres never been anything I wanted to buy. I have minimal material possessions. If you know me youd see I dress like crap and the edges of all of my pants are frayed. I dont own a suit. I dont have a drivers license so fancy cars are out. I like comic books more than paintings. I dont like to fly or sail. And I dont drink wine or eat out a lot. So what did it mean for me back then: DNA. I finally felt good enough about myself to pass on my genes and have children. I never wanted to have children before that. Theres apparently some evolutionary reason that we feel a strong urge to pass on our genes. I had never felt that before but somehow having a significant amount of money gave me permission to want to have kids. Safety. For the briefest of moments, I felt safe  like nothing could harm me and I could live forever. In 1999 I visited the Chairman of a company I was a shareholder of. I was in LA and he picked me up at the hotel in his latest Porsche. We drove to his enormous house and he gave me a tour. When we sat down he told me, I dont even have to do this anymore. I have so much money now that nothing can touch me. I know it sounds unbelievable and a clich but a year later he came down with cancer. After battling with cancer for years he was given worse and worse news about the outlook until eventually he shot himself and his kids found the body. I heard about the news when his wife called everyone in his address book. This is not meant to be a lesson. Money has its benefits but immortality is not one of them. (Although, if you must - How To Live Forever).Another example. A friend of mine was running a prominent gaming site and wanted to maybe sell it or do something with (it was 1999, so why not?) I introduced him to a successful guy I knew on Wall Street. I couldnt even find the guys office. I had never been down as south as Wall Street. My friend and I sat there while Shlomo (not his real name, but you get the drift) said, look at me! Ten years ago I was a shlub. Now I have 100 million dollars. Only in America, right? About two years later Shlomo was in the center of a massive FBI sting involving a currency brokerage he had started that had been simply pocketing investors money since the 70s. He went to jail. Even my orthodox friends turn away and refuse to talk about him whenever I ask if they knew him. Scarcity. My feelings of safety and immortality quickly gave way to scarcity. After all, I thought, if I could make 10 million dollars then it must be too easy. In fact, I honestly thought, everyone else had probably already made 11 million dollars. So then I felt poor again. I now needed 100 million dollars to be happy. I drove in a car with a friend of mine and his wife. I said, everyone has 10 million dollars now. She quickly said, not everyone. Friends. I lost some friends. Then I made some new friends. By the time I was going down in the elevator from my apartment that one last time, 100% of those new friends were destined to never speak to me again (at least through January 12, 2011). My new friends said things like, Mark Cuban is a stud or Fuck him. Take away all his shares or Good luck. Have a nice life or of course its legal! The value of money. I realized (too late then, but I learned) that I never knew the value of money. I had never even been aware of money before. My prior goals had been playing games, making fun websites, or writing novels. Now my only goal was money, money, money, and more money. I told my therapist at the time, in 2001, its like losing a loved one and she said, sweetie, sounds like youve never really lost a loved one before.Money is a great thing. Its the payoff on hard work, great luck (which is often earned luck) and you can do amazing things with it. Build new businesses, create jobs, buy your independence and freedom from corporate America. But first you have to climb many hurdles, of which earning the money is only the first. Very few things are better than earning a lot of money.But money finds a home only in places where its appreciated. I didnt appreciate the money. So it left me.When we were in the car, driving to our new home back in 2002 it was in the middle of a snowstorm. I wanted to cry I felt so bad about what was happening. But it was too much to think about. So for a brief moment I watched the snow and remembered what it was like to be a kid. Tasting the first snow of the year on the tip of my tongue.(Photo by Ricardo Villela)]',\n",

So I figured Id dust off my resume, finally accept every LinkedIn request and just put it out there. You know, to see what was up.EDUCATION: Graduated with a 2.99999 average, BA in Computer Science. Really should not have graduated but begged Fortran professor to move me up from a D- to a D+ and he said, yes. Needed a 3.0 to graduate in 3 years because I didnt want to take out loans for a fourth year. I think I technically still dont have the degree because I owed library fines. Thrown out of graduate school. Failed seven of the eight courses I took in a two year period. Received a letter citing my lack of maturity but that the door was open if I ever somehow gained that maturity. I learned a lot from the experience. I learned that most people back then didnt know how to protect their private files, even if their accounts were password protected. Chances are they left the files in their folder open to the public so if you read the .mbox file you could read all of their email. Read all of the love letters a famous visiting professor had. Read the recommendation from one professor that completely trashed me.I also learned that chances are if you are reduced to stalking the girl you think you love, then chances are its never going to work out. Even if you think shes the only girl you can ever like. With three billion women on the planet its hard to imagine that girl won such an unwanted lottery. During this period I wrote four or five unpublished (or I should say, unpublishable) novels and about 50 short stories.) I drove all my friends crazy by forcing them to read each one. One girl said to my girlfriend, doesnt it bother you that he writes so much about masturbation and prostitution? Another time, I forced my girlfriend to read my 500 page novel and when she was finished and said, this is great! I asked her to tell me the ending she had read ten minutes earlier. She couldnt remember.Altogether I collected about 400 rejection letters. They were all form letters. Not a single note of encouragement.WORK: #10 employee at Fore Systems. Left every day at 4:45pm on the dot, proud of my punctuality. Learned to hitch hike. Closed office door all day long so I could work on various unpublished novels. Quit one day by simply not showing up. Every other employee got rich in the IPO a year or so after I quit. Worked at Carnegie Mellons Center for Machine Translation. Wrote one program that I had to maintain. It never broke so I never had to do any work. Played chess online 20 hours a day until I had carpal tunnel syndrome. Too much one minute chess. The guy in the office next door was writing Lycos, the first big search engine for the world wide web. Whenever my boss knocked on my locked office door I would pretend I wasnt in, particularly if I was in the middle of a game of chess. People complained about me but there was nothing they could do. Nobody could understand the messed-up way I had programmed the program they were all using so nobody could fix it but me. HBO. Was in charge of their website. Started a company on the side. Outsourced HBOs entire website to my own company. Became highest paid junior programmer analyst in HBO as a result. Then spent every Tuesday night interviewing prostitutes and drug dealers for HBO website. Learned important communication skills: like how to interrupt a drunken arguing couple at 3 in the morning and ask them why they were arguing. Learned how to ask out girls who put their phone numbers on the release forms. Had one transvestite explain to me what a chocolate highway was. Had another prostitute justify her income when she said, Men dont pay to have sex with me. Men pay so they can leave after having sex. Shot it as a pilot also for HBO but the head of HBO Family Programming said, for material like this you need to show someone shooting their mother while naked or you need to show your neighbors fucking. Reset. Started a company that made websites for entertainment companies (and Con Edison). Got most of clients through bribery. Else I wouldve had no clients. Got acquired. One year to the day after acquired I quit. Precisely when all the clients were quitting. The company that bought mine went bankrupt three years to the day after buying my company. Vaultus. Started a company that would help Fortune 100 companies create wireless websites. Raised $100 million, including $2 million from Palestinian hero Yasser Arafat. Lost all the money. BUT, Vaultus got acquired by Antenna Software. I was kicked out as CEO and thrown off the board. Tried to use 9/11 as an excuse but boards response was: we were all affected by 9/11. Learned that I am too shy as CEO. Would call secretary before arriving at office to make sure nobody was in the hallway between the elevator and my office so I could run in and lock door. 212 Ventures. Raised $125mm in a VC fund from Investcorp, CS First Boston, First Union (now Wachovia), and, I want to say, Bankers Trust? But is that even a bank now? I forget.\\nPut about $40mm to work, give or take. Maybe $30mm. Return on that $30mm: about $3mm. I am completely blaming the Internet bust. We started putting money to work in March, 2000.\\nDuring this period, lost $15 million of my own money in part by co-investing with VC fund. Lost my home. Lost my sanity for awhile. Started to meditate five hours a day to try and recover. Lost my mind. Found it in the gutter but then lost it again.\\nAlso blaming Investcorp for not giving us more time. They were so disgusted with us they bought out our ten year contract in June, 2001. That said, they wanted me to stay on as an employee but I went the way of\\n Daytrading. Daytraded for myself and for various hedge funds. The first big hedge fund that hired me fired me when I wrote a book and they thought I stole all their ideas. Maybe I did and maybe I didnt. I made money and they went to zero so who knows? Started a fund of hedge funds. Invested in 12 funds. 11 of them are gone now. Several of the fund managers are on the run. One or two will end up in jail. A few of them settled with the SEC. Several are in ongoing discussions with authorities ranging from the SEC to the CFTC to the IRS to the FBI to the DOJ. My initials are JAA. None of the funds are in negotiations with me. Started Stockpickr.com. A social media site for finance. I have nothing bad to say about it. It actually was a good website at the time. Sold it to thestreet.com. I had a three year contract with thestreet. After about 8 months I stopped showing up for work. I dont think I ever went in the building again. After 2 years they asked to change my contract and reduce my salary. I quit and offered to write for them for free but they said no for some reason. I waived my severance pay so I could write for others. A few weeks ago they asked me to write for them again when they reviewed their historical pageview records and saw my pageview numbers. But I ignored the email. Good luck! Started junglesmash.com. Was very successful in its first few months of crowdsourcing advertisements for major brands without their permission. Procter &amp; Gamble even submitted ads for their own products, trying to win the $1000 reward I was offering. The second brand was Monster Soda. 30 or so submissions. Then I lost interest and just stopped updating the site. My ex-wife and I were separating and I lost interest in everything. My TV appearances were depressing to watch. Junglesmash went down the tubes. All of my investing went south. And it was October, 2008 so every time I went on TV the Dow lost another 500 points. I wrote to Erin Burnett, whose show I went on every Tuesday and told her that every time I was on her show the Dow went down 500 points. She stopped responding and she stopped inviting me on. The Financial Times stopped my column in March 2009. I suspect it was because I was too bullish. The market doubled almost immediately afterwards. Probably because I was handing out chocolate to every trader who walked into the New York Stock Exchange in March, 2009. So in a several month period I stopped going on CNBC, stopped writing for the FT, stopped going on Yahoo Finance, and stopped writing for thestreet.com. And then the market went straight up. I started a company: 140love.com  a dating site for Twitter. On the day money was being raised I shut down the company and returned whatever money had already come in. I had lost interest because I was no longer dating. I thought starting a dating site would increase my odds of finding a date but once I found someone I lost interest in the site. Plus it was a bad idea. For the life of me I cant remember the bulk of what I did between May, 2009 and November 2010. I know during this period I got married, I went to India, I went to Argentina (two countries I never thought I would visit) and I moved out of NYC. But I cant remember anything else. Oh, I took a job with a private equity firm for about a week or so. One day, in the middle of a meeting I had set up I said, excuse me for just one minute, I have to go to the bathroom and I walked out of the meeting, walked out of the building without my coat, walked to the subway, went to Grand Central, and never came back to the office. Never returned their calls afterwards. November 2010. I got sick of it. IT. I didnt care anymore. Sick of kissing ass. Getting clients for bullshit. Raising money. Listening to lies. Lying to people. Taking meetings. Talking to people I didnt like. Always anxious. Always worried. Always defending after offending. I took a big giant break.I would only talk to people I liked. Only businesses I liked. Only write what I wanted to write. Only think about what I wanted to think about. Breathe in the fresh air. Breathe it out. It felt like a great weight was lifted off of my shoulders. I was out of the game. I didnt want to play anymore. I started a blog at jamesaltucher.com to be honest about it all. I wrote a bunch of books. I write for other places. I didnt care what anyone said about me or thought about me. I wanted to expose what I thought was all the brainwashing. I liked what I was doing. I started focusing on my health and spiritual life more. Doing the same thing. Every day I ask: what else could I be doing. I wait for the answer. And then I do it. Today: Im grateful you read this. I am alive.Photo:  carballo  / Shutterstock]',\n",
       "  124: '[Its easy to get anonymous people to hate you. Have an opinion. Be creative. Be yourself.But sometimes it gets worse. Ive had death threats, legal threats, Ive lost friends, even family, over things Ive written. Ive lost the respect of many I still respect. Articles get written then people hate me even more.A hater can be anyone. A family member, a friend, a colleague, a teacher, a boss, or some random person you meet on the street or the Internet. People who were friends forever can suddenly be haters. You HAVE to have the tools to deal with it.It always feels miserable. I am never cavalier about it.I wanted to like these people in some cases. 20 year friendships. Friends I thought I would have forever. Now gone.Most haters are just invisible, anonymous, just trying to get in your head because thats THEIR particular method of having a human connection.Example: someone wrote a review of my audio book the other day:SIMPLY TERRIBLE the author should NEVER EVER read his own books again. He has a lazy, mumbling speech that made it difficult to give him credibility right off the bat. He sounded a bit disinterested, like it was a bother to pass along these precious gems on knowledge to us, the poor miserable audience.Im not fishing for compliments. Some people like my audio book, some people dont. But it reminds me of 7th grade, when we had to take turns reading from a book in a class called Woodshop.Who wouldve thought that in Woodshop I would learn all the basic skills that allowed me to build businesses and develop meaningful relationships later in life?Well, not me, and I was right. I learned nothing there.The only great moment that happened to me in woodshop was when the prettiest girl in school ran up to me and said, Quick, quick, what psychiatrist talks all the time about sex? And I said, Freud and then she ran away to have a deep conversation with the woodshop teacher twenty years older than her.I definitely dont remember what we were reading in the woodshop book that day but when it was my turn to speak, Christin Herholz said, oh no, not HIS voice again.So maybe that reviewer is right. Maybe Christin is actually the reviewer! Synchronicity! (Jung).No matter what we do in life, we get some people who hate us, who make fun of us, who gossip about us, who backstab us, who take money from us or do something to try and ruin our reputation, who threaten us, who tease us, who frighten us.SO LISTEN TO ME: these are the rules how to deal with haters  the anonymous ones, the ones in your face, the ones at work, the ones you cant avoid, family, and people you love.Its hard to do. Sometimes I cant do them. But bit by bit I get better at these rules. And when I get better, I can see better results in my life. I hope you will also.I) ITS ABOUT THEMThis is a bit of a cliche but its true. Behind every Anger is a Fear.Whoever hates, is also afraid of something. This doesnt mean you say, poor baby, hes just afraid. But its just worth noting.For instance, in the above review, the reviewer said, the poor miserable audience. Maybe her fear is of being poor and miserable and so she hears someone saying that to her no matter who is talking. This is her problem in life right now.Often people say, oh, dont worry, they are just jealous. Maybe they are. Maybe they arent. We can never read their minds.Its none of my business why someone thinks something of me.But something is going on in their lives that is bringing up a fear. And they indulge the fear by having an anger towards you. By projecting their own fear onto you. For a brief moment, you become the monster that has been hiding onside of them.Anger is just fear indulged.II) IT ALSO REALLY IS ABOUT YOUMost people who hate me I never even think about. But some haters push buttons. Some accidentally know how to get under my skin.Or not accidentally. Like when a family member hates you and knows EXACTLY what buttons to press (you never bathe, etc).When someone pushes a button, I get angry and maybe even defensive. But its NOT because they said something horrible.Its because under the fleshy armor of rage, Im afraid they might be right.I might not even admit this to myself. They put the knife in, after all, so I can accuse them. But the reality is I might be twisting the knife in even further.Take the above example again. I pulled it out from 100s I couldve used. Not because it was particularly mean. But I just realized I then told you a story of what happened to me in seventh grade when a girl made fun of my voice.So maybe I really am afraid I have some weird sort of voice. I dont know. Its just worth noting to myself.When all you do is note something to yourself, it at least separates it out from the non-stop chatter in the head. It lets you identify it and put it in its own special cage. This makes it easier to identify and deal with and maybe even learn something about yourself.III) THE 24 HOUR RULEIf someone attacks you in any way, you might get bad feelings. If its a public attack then others might get bad feelings. People will say, Jane said this about James so he must be an idiot.Or it might an office politics attack. Or an attack in a relationship.The 24 Hour Rule works in almost every case. If you never respond to the initial attack, it goes away in 24 hours. If you respond EVEN ONCE, then reset the clock. Its another 24 hours as it spreads through the spider web of human interaction.This is why some battles go on for years. Nobody stops responding. The attack continues until one person dies. And as the Onion states: World Mortality Rate Holds Steady At 100%.IV) THE 30/30/30 RULEI had a few posts where I stole the same image of a woman doing yoga poses on a beach. I got some criticism for always using images of a sexy woman. I also got criticism for taking the images and not giving credit.Then the woman in the images actually wrote me. I told her I was getting this criticism.She told me her whole beautiful story which I included in my last book. But one thing she said was that for every creative thing you do: 1/3 will love you, 1/3 will hate you, and 1/3 wont care.Which means you should do what you love. You should do the best you can. You should try to do the things that will help you improve every day. And when bad comments come, just put them in that 1/3 bucket where it belongs.V) DELETEIm always happy when someone disagrees with me. I dont mind that.But often people are incapable of expressing disagreement and it comes out in a way that is obnoxious or hateful.When I can, I delete them. I can put delete in quotes. Sometimes its not a blog commenter but someone in real life. I delete them also. I dont speak to people who are bad for me.What if its a boss or someone you have to speak to? Well, I dont engage with them. I let them do their thing. I nod hello in the hallways. I dont kiss anyones ass to get them to like me, not even my daughters. Everyone gets their time in the time out box. And eventually, they can come out again if they behave.What if its someone screaming at you on the phone? Just do this: I have to go. Thats worked against me, particularly when I was younger and wanted to scream more. Why are you DOING THIS TO ME!? And it felt very painful.But it made me behave better next time.VI) HATE IS CONTAGIOUSSomeone tweeted awhile ago: James Altucher = #humangarbage. I dont know why he tweeted it. I didnt know who he was. But I got angry for a second. I didnt follow any of the above commandments.I looked him up. He works at AOL. I tried to figure out how to get him fired. He made his one tweet but then it gave me maybe 1000 thoughts.The worst thing you can do to your body is stab it. Anger is an emotional stab at your emotional body. Some religions say you should show compassion to your enemies. I dont know. This is really hard to do.The best I can do is recognize that I dont know this person, and that every additional thought is another way for me to stab myself. Then the infection spreads inside of me, consumes me.I dont like to stab myself.VII) YOULL NEVER KNOWI couldve contacted the guy and said, I just need to know: why do you think I am human garbage.But this is one of those death bed moments.People have said, I am really glad I found out why that random stranger called me human garbage on their death bed exactly zero times in the history of the universe.Theres no need to know. And even if you do finally knowit will always turn out there was no good reason.VIII) RESISTANCE IS FUTILELets say someone does actually have a reason for hating you. And its easy to refute. Like they hate you because you are from Rhode Island but actually you are from Canada. You can say, But Im from Canada and they will say, Ugh, thats even worse.Nobody ever changes their mind. Change is hard. Quitting cigarettes is very hard, almost impossible for many people.Hating is even more addictive so imagine how hard it is to change someones mind. Facts dont matter. Defending yourself makes it worse (see the 24 Hour Rule).Even a history of friendship doesnt matter. You can say, Weve been friends for 20 years. Are you really going to let this get in the way of that?And the answer is Yes. Because they cant help themselves. Because its about some fear they have. Because its about some fear you have. And never the twain shall meet.IX) THEY LOOK STUPID HAVING SEXThats all you ever really need to know about your haters. They all grunt and drool and look stupid.If all you do is think of this rule about someone who hates you, then you can ignore all of the other rules.X) TIME HEALS ALL WOUNDSHate cant last forever. Often it turns into a dull simmer. The sun that was so bright at noon, becomes a haze of purples and deep orange by twilight.This doesnt mean that you and the hater are now friends. It just means that the wound that was opened will eventually close up, and leave a tiny scar, a reminder but nothing more. Whether it was a betrayal. An ex-partner. An ex-lover. A commenter on a blog.The key is to practice shortening the time.You do this with the other nine commandments above. You do this with the daily practice of physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health I recommend in my book.I say the daily practice not because I want you to buy my book. Dont buy it. Its so easy you dont need to read anything other than the above paragraph.Do all this and the hate passes right through you. Its hard to avoid all the haters. They are in your face sometimes. But you can do these methods.For some people hate and anger and bitterness and regret last for years. Sometimes the time it takes to heal a wound lasts longer than a lifetime.This is a waste of a lifetime.Thats ok also. Nobody is requiring you to have a fulfilling life. Its totally your choice to waste your life.And since many people will hate you as you stick your head out of the sand again and again (as I hope you do), you will have many opportunities to ruin your life. Enjoy them.Sometimes (not every time) the more people who hate you, the more it means you are getting out of the comfort zone. You are creating and growing.But hopefully your woulds heal more and more quickly. I say your but I really mean me. I hope my wounds every day heal more quickly than the day before. I wrote this post for me.When a hater takes his or her stab, I try to use the above techniques to maybe learn about myself. And if I cant learn a lot then maybe I can learn a little.And if I cant learn a little, then at least I will try to avoid getting sick.And if I dont get sick, then I will try to be thankful. And I move onto the next thing I can do. The next place where I will try to find love, creativity, and fulfillment. (Photo by: Erik Gustafson)]',\n",
       "  125: '[I showed up at the SATs in my pajamas. I had woken up late for the most important test of my life  the one test that determines what college you get into, which then determines how happy you are, who will marry you, how much money you make, and how many people you can legally kill or maim before they jail you in a minimum security prison while your money rests in Swiss bank accounts. I rushed out of bed, got two number 2 pencils and went off to the school on that Saturday morning.About 200 kids from all over the county were waiting to take the test and were crowding up the hallway. I am not exaggerating: when I arrived they parted down the middle like I was Moses. I was in my pajamas: glasses, acne, my hair uncombed and in every direction and grasping those two number two pencils. I was like the God of the SATs.I clearly looked like someone who was going to kick ass on the SATs. I was 17 but I had been taking the SATs every year, as practice, since I was 12. I remember crying at age 12 begging my mom to teach me the quadratic formula, just in case.What a joke. I cant even remember the quadratic formula now or what its used for.Because nothing is used for anything.Our lives are the worst misshapen archaeological digs. Imagine a skyscraper built on top of an aquarium, built on top of a merry-go-round built on top of an earthquake fault in the middle of a volcano. None of it makes sense. Its a maze, a mish-mash, a mess.And yet thats how we grow up. Get good grades or it goes on your record (nightmares still of my mom screaming at me when I was in fourth grade and caught shoplifting: YOUR RECORD your record YOUR RECORD!!!!). Get a good SAT score. Go to a good college, then graduate school. Get a good wife , get a good raise, a promotion, move horizontally through the corporate ladder, then vertically, zigzag up like in the childhood game Chutes &amp; Ladders! Get money, get a good car, fly business, then first, get art, build a stock portfolio, get your kids on the same path you were in (if it was a good enough for me, it better goddamn well be good enough for you, you spoiled little brat!), get a new kidney because I have so much money, get an award, get multiple women crying at your funeral, and tough guys, Old Men of the Sea, spilling at your ashes over the ocean (the world will never be the same, one of them finally says after the requisite silence.) GOD BLESS AMERICA!What the hell just happened? I was going to write about YOUR major life decisions and for half the intro Im a virgin in pajamas with two pencils comparing myself to Moses.Ok, 12 MAJOR LIFE DECISIONS YOU MAKE WITHOUT THINKING.A) College. Oh my god. How many times do I have to say it. I even wrote a book about it. Ive been writing about this since 2006. Finally the NY Times has caught on. Mark Cuban even wrote an article. People are finally realizing it: COLLEGE IS/WAS/WILL BE A SCAM. I mean this in the worst possible way. Its the US government trying to rob our 18 year olds (who do you think backs the $300,000 in student loans you graduate with?) because theyve stolen from us until were shopping in dollar stores in Vermont as the only way to survive. Ive written and argued and explained too much on this one so you can read about what Ive said here and that will lead to the rest of the links. Note: I give alternatives that are MUCH BETTER than sending your kids to college.But my main question for this article is: why do we think our 17 years olds are prepared to make a decision that involves a half a million dollars at this early stage in their lives (DO NOT argue with me about the math. I will beat you down with a stick.)?B) House. Oh sure, you can buy a house for $200k and sell it 10 years later for $400k. Thats the extent of how people think about this decision. Were not allowed to think deeper. Its the American Dream. Its ROOTS. Its whats needed to create stability before we can CREATE. We NEED A HOUSE. Its drilled into us from an early age. Not even the white picket fence. Just something innocuous thats implanted like a secret science fiction chip into our brain: Just a place I can rest my feet and call my home. A place I can plant flowers. A place I change the walls. ROOTS.Its such BS. And again, I write about it. But: maintenance, property taxes, interest payments, more maintenance, time spent, lack of flexibility, lack of ability to maximize your income because you are stuck, illiquidity of a massive investment, massive debt  and is the debt backed by the US government. God Praise the Queen! Or the President. Or the Minister of Security. Whoever. Someone has their hand in your pocket. Theres a hole in your pocket. They are feeling around past the hole.You! My good friend. Have just been molested.C) Marriage. Ive never seen something like how it is in the movies: two people meet in a cab and then head to Las Vegas and get married. Maybe it happens in real life but Ive never seen it. But Ive seen two people, age 23, meet for a first date and then ten days later get married. Or even worse, two people live together for 5 years and then finally decide to get married.What the hell are you thinking? Marriage is like the worst thing ever (married people, hold off, Im going to come full circle on this)\\nYoure going to spend the next 70 years with that person EVERY SINGLE DAY\\nYoure going to see that person in every worst possible way. On the first date, imagine them in the hospital with tubes sticking into every hole in their body and their head shaved. Now kiss them.\\nYoure done. Unless you are cheating (please dont do that. Its too stressful for everyone involved, its unhygienic and could spread disease, and it will destroy all the people around you) you are not having sex with ANYONE ELSE for the rest of your life.\\nThe passion in your marriage will eventually wear off. Not necessarily, but its a normal part of life. As Ive written before, theres the saying: put a penny in a jar everytime you have sex before the marriage, take a penny out every time you have sex after. Youll never empty the jar. I hope that doesnt happen to me but well see.\\nIt costs money! On average, that is. Lets say 50% of marriages end in divorce (I dont care if the number is accurate. Some large number ends in divorce) then imagine the expenses of supporting two households. Or three. Or I know people with five households they are supporting. It really hurts.\\nYou might fall in love again. With someone else. Anything can happen. We are talking 70 years! Hope that it doesnt happen to you but some people are addicted to falling in love. Maybe your new spouse is. I hope not!\\nPeople change. What you liked about your wife when she was 23 might be 100% different at 33 and 100% different at 43. I hope you change together but thats a pretty big gamble. If you were a gambling man would you gamble that two people are going to change together over a period of 70 years? I would almost never make that bet without incredible odds.\\nThis doesnt mean I hate marriage. I love being married. Heres my post on The Purpose of Marriage.Just dont make this major life decision without thinking about it. I have a checklist in the above post. Make sure you can AT LEAST check all of those boxes.D) Children. First off, before I rant, I LOVE my children. Someone sent me an angry email the other day:Your the biggest prick in the world for talking about how your 10 yr old daughter is spewing BS and vomit from her mouth when she lies to you. Your a sad excuse for a father you piece of shit. You cruel, heartless bastard. I hope you lose your wealth and your possessions and wake up to what this life is all about you shit head scumbag.My emailers name is Tom Wait and he lives in Newark, California. I am grateful when I get an email like that. It lets me test myself. I dont respond. And I feel bad that his anger has forced him to unleash on me like that. But I also have to consider: do I talk about my kids too much. I dont think so.So I will talk about them more:Kids suck. And people just keep spewing their sperm around, making more kids, like its the easiest decision in the world. Then suddenly you have a new US citizen living in your house who is one foot tall, cant even walk without your help, screams all the time, doesnt speak English, craps on the floor, and has to fed by you. OUT OF YOUR BREASTS if you are a woman.Are you crazy?Then we get older it gets a little betterif you like being a chauffeur all day long and hanging out in kids stores and watching cartoon movies about baby bears lost in the jungle. I mean we are talking some serious bad decision making here when you have a kid.Now, its not all that bad. (my daughters making each other laugh make up for it) but lets not forget:Kids cost money. $30k per pregnancy, then thousands per year on food and clothes. Then thousands every year on school supplies, books, gas to drive them places. Then thousands every year after they hit 18. Then maybe 10s of thousnads a year after they hit 35. And will they ever appreciate it? Well see. I dont know yet.And even worse: having a kid really changes your relationship with your spouse. Now the kid is her (or his) love of her life. You have to really see and pay attention to how the kid affects your relationship with your spouse or that could suddenly get a whole lot more expensive (see above). Believe me. But people dont think of this. Dont think of the consequences. Its not true that no time is a good time. Thats just an excuse to make a bad decision. The sperm hits the ovum and KA-BOOM!E) Eat. You are what you eat. I cant even think of a more true statement. Where do you think the atoms in your body even come from. A lot of it comes from the food you eat. Most people dont think twice about: cheese Danish in the morning, pasta and spring rolls for lunch, potato chips during the day, 8 cups of coffee, steak and fries and ice cream at night with a bottle of wine to smooth out the day. Im not describing your meals. Im describing how I used to eat. Every day. But the wine might start by 10am. Just to feel good about my afternoon meetings.See my post on how Lisa lost 100 pounds. Sugar hurts your bones, increases wrinkles, and makes you stupid she told me the other day. And sugar is in about 99% of the products sold in the grocery store. So people blindly do it because its hard to do otherwise.F) Media. Again, you are what you eat! Even if you eat dog shit all day. Im a firm believer in this: you have four bodies. Not just one. A physical body that you have to take care of to live. But also an emotional body. A mental body. And a spiritual body. These bodies need food to survive also. If they die or get sick then you die and get sick in some way.The emotional and mental bodies get their sustenance from the things you read, the stuff you watch on TV, the people around you and what they are saying or gossiping about. You are what you eat. The spiritual body lives on your ability to be grateful, on your ability to ignore the daggers and hate that are constantly thrown your way (see email above under Children) Otherwise it will starve to death. And so will you. And so you will your ability to love others and make others happy.When you are grateful for others, their accomplishments, their successes, their magic, becomes yours. Then you are better than human. Then you are magic.But people dont think twice about picking up the worst crap to read on the train, on the plane, before bed, or lets watch these shows or watch these movies. Or hang out with these gossipers, or spend a day not being grateful for thefor theI cant even fill it in. Just being grateful FOR.G) Stocks. People will look at every detail of a $30,000 car before making a purchase decision but lose $100,000 in seconds on a bad stock purchase that they didnt do any due diligence on. This is why I write 10 reasons people should never own stocks. But if you want to own stocks, build a checklist in advance. A plan. You will only own a stock if it has these 10 features. And dont put more than 3-5% of your portfolio in any one stock. Dont be an idiot. But people were, are, and always will be. I see it every day.H) Luxuries. When I was five I wanted a drumset so my parents got me one. I never used it. So when my kid was five and wanted a drumset I, of course, got her one. She never used it. The same goes for most of our purchases. Think how much money you can save per year if you just avoided all the things you never used for more than a week a year. It would be thousands Im sure.I)  Jobs.  Most people hate their job. I get emails every day, I hate my job. I wrote a post, 10 reasons you need to quit your job right now. But people are brainwashed by the American Dream into thinking: job, promotions, money, raises, bonuses, SUCCESS.This is not what success is about. And yet it feels good to be wanted. It feels good when they make that offer. SO you dont think twice about it. After all, you got that degree in accounting so why not be an accountant. Again, make a checklist. Ill do another post on what I think that checklist should be. But dont make a decision will effect the next 20 years of your life without doing the appropriate due diligence.J) Alcohol. Most people I know drink at least five times a week. Im not going to criticize. Theres lots of reasons to drink. It takes the edge off a hard week (see Hate job above). It gives you that buzz so you lose inhibitions in an awkward social situation (that first date ten days before you get married, for instance). Some people like the taste (ugh, give me a vanilla milkshake instead, even with all the sugar).But think about how much you spend on alcohol a year. That can be just cash in your bank. And meanwhile, you avoid the sugar in alcohol, the bad ramifications when you lose those inhibitions, and all of the cancer-linked diseases that are related to alcohol. Not to mention the general harm against your liver. I dont even know what my liver does. But if something gets in the way of peeing and shitting then its NO GOOD.If you avoid these ten things, think of how much money you would avoid losing in the 20 year period between 18 and 38. Just think about it. I can tell you for me the number is in the multi-millions. It adds up each year.Im not saying thats not worth it. Im not saying you shouldnt make these decisions.Its just that people make these multi-million dollar decisions without even a second thought. At the time it seems like nothing. Its love, or chemicals, or addictions.Or even worse, its what your parents told you to do. Or your friends. Or your colleagues. They want to feel justified in their own horrible decisions.Or even worse than that  its the American system of non-stop brainwashing via government agendas and commercialism. Who backs the student loans. Who backs the home loans. Who wants you in jobs paying maximum taxes? Who wants you paying those surplus taxes on alcohol? And the billion dollar companies advertising to you all day long when you are semi-hypnotic states watching brain-dead TV.Thats a lot of pressure. Its really hard to avoid it. I didnt avoid it. And I paid. I paid too much. And Im still paying. It will never end.The biggest challenge in being an adult, in saving money, in having freedom, in having success, is the ability to break free from the brainwashing, is to break free from the Matrix. To live your own life without everyone trying to drag you down into their HELL.Because when you break free, the hands grasping at you from the depths of hell will finally lose their grip and slip back into their own self-created abscesses. Youll start to float higher. Youll feel free, light, unencumbered except by your own wonderful decisions. Decisions made from a deep well of infinity inside of you that hasnt been tainted or tarnished. Or, through the daily practice you can begin the process of cleaning it.Its never too late. Ive made every one of the decisions above. Often for the wrong reasons. Often repeatedly. And Ive suffered for it. Weve all suffered to some extent. Thats what life is. But cleansing the four bodies I mention above, also begins the arduous process of alchemizing those prior decisions into a gold you could not have imagined. Into an abundance you only dreamed about.And no matter what those choices are, when you are making them with full consciousness, with a cleanliness that goes straight through to the soul, youll rise above the hells everyone else lives in. Youll be in your own personal heaven.(Photo by Leah Jones)]',\n",
       "  126: '[A friend of mine left his corporate job after 23 years of being trapped in the Matrix. I hate it because Im envious of that moment. The day I left a corporate job to be on my own for the first time. Suddenly you go from managing a cubicle from the hours of 9 to 5 to having to manage ALL OF TIME AND SPACE. The holograph screens that altered the universe around you peel away to show you what the real world looks like. The extra colors and intensity that had been hidden from you behind tinted-black glass windows and fluorescent lights.I wish I had done it differently. I wish I had known what I know now.I was working at HBO. I had a cubicle on the 6th Floor of 1100 Sixth Avenue. My boss was down the hall. His boss was in the room next to his. His boss was in the room next to that. And the real boss (the top guys secretary) was in front of all of their offices. I had a view of the McDonalds at Sixth Avenue which is now the big Bank of America building.(I did the website for seasons 1-3 of Sex and The City)Work in the corporate world is like a hazy drug dream to me now. You could get in at 10am. Everyone took breaks downstairs to smoke. I didnt smoke so I took licorice with me. Then at noon, LUNCH! And then after lunch, chess in Bryant Park. Then my boss left to catch his train at 4:15. So I would leave at 4:16. Before I had my own business on the side Id take the subway to Astoria and go to Steinway Billiards. Everyone there was Greek. Wed all sit and play backgammon and chess and drink thick Greek coffee until about two in the morning. Sometimes my friends from HBO would come with me and it would be like a party every night. And I loved all the girls in the place but not a single one ever talked to me or looked at me no matter how many two dollar bills I tipped with.There were goals and deadlines at work. Except for the summer. There was never anything to do in the summer. And all other times the deadlines were mild. Like if you missed one then it just meant a meeting was rescheduled. Nobody would get fired. The saying was, if you want to get fired you have to stand on Albies desk and pee on him. That was the bosss bosss boss. As part of my job I got to go to San Francisco for the first time, Los Angeles, and sunny Orlando (to make the website for the series From the Earth to the Moon which was shot right in Disneyworld.)And then I quit.I had to. I was running a business on the side. We had clients, some of whom were even competitors to HBO. We had employees. I had payroll to meet. And I felt myself stagnating at my job. I couldnt get out of bed in the morning. I stopped enjoying the meager things I was doing. And I thought I could handle the psychology of being on my own. What could be different, I thought. I wanted to spread my wings even though I had no idea how to fly.I cried twice the first day on my own.First time, at lunch with one of my partners, Randy. It suddenly hit me that I didnt have a multi-billion media empire as my backstop. I was on my own. I felt alone. Which is another way of saying, if I fucked up I had nobody to blame. Like we all did in corporate America. So over pizza I cried. Are you ok? Randy said. Poking at my weakness. Yeah, I said.Then later at dinner with all my ex-employees and friends at HBO. I ordered pasta AND fries. Everyone started to laugh at what I had ordered and I wasnt sure why. That made me cry again but nobody noticed. I felt like a four year old in a room filled with laughing adults. I had no idea what I was or what I was supposed to be.I had been anchored close to shore with Time Warner as the dock. Now I was in deep waters. Too deep to anchor. I had to fish now. I had to find food. I had to get water. I had to feed a lot of people. I had to kill or be killed. I learned a lot in the next few months:A) It was always my fault when things went wrong. If you blame others, you go out of business. Take responsibility for your problems and fix them or move on.B) I had to communicate to people. If you hide from customers, they will fire you. If you hide from employees they lose respect for you. If you hide from investors, they sue you.C) I had to help employees feel good about their jobs. I had to help customers feel their jobs were about to get a lot easier because now I was in their lives. I had to learn to reward people. I wanted everyone around me to feel good about it. To spread the word that I was someone to work with, to be around.D) Every idea was fair game. We were a web design company but we considered being a tea company, a rap label, a magazine, a TV show, a cable channel, and a social network for dead people. A porn site. A software company. An ad agency. And a dozen other things. We just wanted to make money. We were in the business of business.E) People steal. I was robbed by customers, by employees, by friends, by partners, and twice by random criminals including one guy who just walked into our office and started unscrewing lightbulbs until he was chased out.F) I had to educate. You demonstrate credibility when you teach your employees and when you teach your customers. Where do you get your knowledge? You have to get to the destination before everyone else. You have to read everything. You have to have spies. An important side effect of educating people is that you build presence, you build charisma, you exude confidence that is earned.G) I had to learn when the day ended. The candles are always lit in the modern age. The day never has to end. But if it doesnt, you lose track of the map and find yourself adrift with no horizon in any direction.H) I had to forgive myself. When you run things, 50% of your decisions will still be bad. Good opportunities sometimes spring from bad decisions. But you have to forgive yourself first as the first process in learning from your mistakes.I) I had to make tough decisions. I couldnt complain to my boss. I had to fire people. Fire customers. Make decisions that might be right or wrong about people. Making decisions is directly correlated to building your idea muscle until you are an idea machine.J) I had to network. I never had to do that before. I would hire people specifically to help me network because I was so bad at it but I got better. Your value goes up exponentially depending on the number of people in your network. Keith Ferrazzi hits the nail on the head in his book Never Eat Alone. You need to not only consciously arrange to meet people but also put yourself in many situations where you are going to randomly collide with people. My most random collisions often made me the most money.K) I had to sell the company. When web design was being taught in junior high school classes I knew that 3 page websites being built for $75,000 was going to be a thing of the past. Knowing when to sell is just as important as knowing when to start a business. Selling a business gives you the greatest gift of all  freedom to start another business.(Did the website for The Matrix)Most importantly, I had to build a discipline of every day, every hour, seeking out opportunities. Either opportunities for the business, or even for myself. My own improvement became vital to the improvement of the business, to my customers, and to employees. I cried the first day, and many many days after that. And looking back, I cant really tell you if it was worth it or not. Who really knows? So many things have worked out and so many things have failed. Maybe Im mediocre as an entrepreneur, best case.But I do feel like Ive escaped the Matrix of corporate slavery that first day. Eventually I realized that there was yet another matrix outside of that matrix. Like Russian nesting dolls, each matrix is a creation of the matrix outside of it. On and on, forever. Each day another escape but only if Im brave enough.(For more stories on entrepreneurship, sign up for my free email list. Photos courtesy and owned respectively by HBO and Warner Bros.)]',\n",
       "  127: '[I get the question a lot during my Twitter Q&amp;A sessions: \"Do you have to be dishonest to be successful?\" Many people feel (or are afraid, or are using as an excuse) that dishonesty is the currency of success. I say, it\\'s actually the opposite. To be successful, to be calm, to be tranquil, to grow in life, you must be honest. MUST.Often they say back, \"That\\'s not been my experience.\" And I feel bad for them. Because we\\'ve all been there. I\\'ve been there. Screwed, demoralized, betrayed, bankrupt. But I have only found success by climbing up the ladder of honesty one rung at a time. This is the only way I know of, the only 100% accurate way to live a life of success. It has worked for me after the most horrific circumstances.Nobody believes me on this. People laugh at me. Dont you know anything? Of course dishonest people step on the honest people and have more success. People want to justify their own failures and use their pretend-goodness to explain why they didnt start Google, or steal $65 billion, or get that last promotion when the backstabbing bitch from aisle3 got the raise after doing who knows what.But heres the truth.Dishonesty works until it doesnt. Everyone messes up. And when you are dishonest you are given only one chance and then its over. Youre out of the game, at least until you get your act straight and you have to start from scratch with your tail between your legs.Honesty compounds. It compounds exponentially. No matter what happens in your bank account, in your career, in your promotions, in your startups. Honesty compounds exponentially over not days or weeks but years and decades. More people trust your word and spread the news that you are a person to be sought out, sought after, given opportunity, given help, given money. This is what will build your empire.I know this through countless failures. The more times I fail but communicate about it, the more times I make no money at all but let someone have ideas for free, the more times I try to get mine but only end up getting stabbed by those who think its ok to be dishonest, the greater the number of seeds planted and the more money in the long run Ive made. Be dishonest once, and all of those seeds will be washed away in a thunderstorm of life-killing proportions. A hurricane of despair that will sweep away all of your opportunities forever.10 Ways to Be Honest:\\nGive Credit. Even if the ideas were all yours. Even if you made nothing on them. Even if they were blatantly stolen. Give credit and move on. Hoarding your ideas for the moment when you can shine, will only leave by yourself in a dimly lit room.\\nBE THE SOURCE. But if I give ideas for free, what if they couldve made a billion dollars. I always get screwed by my partners. If you are the source of ideas then you are ALWAYS the source. Forget the losers who steal. Move on. You become THE fountain of ideas. People come to the fountain and make wishes and throw money in. Dont be a trickle of dirty water. Be the fountain and let people know it by giving away all credit and rewards.\\nIntroduce Two People. Every day you can think of at least two people to introduce to each other that will help each other. You dont have to be in the middle. Take me off cc you should say. Let them help each other. Let them benefit. You dont need to be in the middle and benefit this time. Youll benefit next time. Or the time after that. Even if it means giving up opportunities for yourself if you think someone else would be better for the job.\\nTake the Blame. I messed up in October, 2008. I was going through separation, financial crisis, I was scared out of my mind. I was managing a little bit of money a hedge fund had allocated me. I was down that month. It was ground zero of the goddamn financial crisis. I would sleep in my hammock until it would rain and storm all over me and the next thing I would know the Dow was down another 700 points while I was soaked and sick and angry. The hedge fund manager called me at the end of the month and said, look, Ive called you 10 times and you didnt return the call. Just return the call once and it wouldve been ok. Now Ive got to take the money back. He was right. Were good friends now and have worked together since but it took a few years to build back the trust.\\nDont lead a double life. Everything you do takes up space in your brain. If you live a double life (and you know what I mean if Im talking to you) then that extra life takes up neurons and synapses working overtime. The brain cant handle it. It starts to degrade instead of grow. Living a double life mightve given you momentary pleasure but now your brain is heading straight for the gutter. And your finances, which is a reflection of the health of your brain, will fall straight into the sewer with it.\\nDont be Angry. Anger is a form of dishonesty. Nobodys perfect. Its a lie to expect the people around you to be perfect. Sometimes Im angry at my kids. But they are just kids. Sometimes Im angry at people Im trying to do deals with. But they have their own motivations, fears, worries, anxieties. They dont have to do everything I expect of them. So my anger is really a belief that they should do what I expect them to do. Thats lying to myself and dishonest in my expectations of them. Of course, you cant control your anger. Sometimes it just happens. But note it for what it is, examine it, and try to turn it around, even just a little  in order to learn more about yourself rather than to blame someone else. Thats where the honesty will compound.\\nNo excuses. When I lost money in October, 2008 it was easy to blame a manipulated market and all the criminals that led it to be that way. When I lost millions of dollars in 2000 to the point of going completely broke and losing my home it was easy to blame an Internet bust and corrupt CEOs rather than my own lack of experience in the world of money. Excuses are easy lies we tell ourselves to cover up our failures. One such excuse is, only dishonest people get ahead. This is also a lie.\\nMake Others Look Good. This is more than just giving credit. Theres a commonly quoted rule in management: The Pareto Rule  which states that 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people. This is, in part, a product of an inferior standardized educational system where kids for 20 years are encouraged to do the minimum required to pass and make to the the next level on some imaginary ladder of success. But everyone wants to be acknowledged for small achievement. Take out your microscope. Acknowledge even the smallest accomplishments done by the people around you. Bring more and more of the people around you into the 20%. At heart, everyone wants to be perceived as special. Thats because everyone is special but are often never acknowledged that way. You be different. Be aware of the smallest movements around you and acknowledge them. Nobody will forget that.\\nDont gossip. One time I trashed an entrepreneur I had invested in to another investor. Later that day I was supposed to have dinner with the entrepreneur. By that time, just four hours later, he had heard I trashed him. He never trusted me again. People always hear. And if they dont hear, they feel, because word gets around. And you cant predict this. And its another way of living a double life.\\nDo what you say youre going to do. Be that guy.\\nBONUS POINT: Ok, I said 10. But Im doing 11. In 1999 some of my employees in my first company left and started a competitor. Some of my partners were mad. I encouraged the employees. How come? Because nobody needs to be my employee for their entire lives. Always help people grow into their own potential. My only thing I tell these people is: if you ever find me in the gutter with a needle sticking out of my elbow, please help me out. They laugh and say, that will never happen. Believe me. Anything can happen. Ive been helped out of that gutter more than once.\\nI havent always been honest. I try. And I hope Im getting better. I try every day to improve and to follow the advice above. Else I wouldnt give the advice.But Ive seen it. People who have been in business for 10, 20, 40 years. Honestly compounds little by little. And that compounding turns into millions or billions. The dishonest people disappear. They die. They go to jail. They dont maximize their potential. They run. They are scared.You will have nobody to run from. Some people will hate you. Some people will doubt your sincerity. But the people who need someone to call, someone to share with, someone to give to, these people will know who to call. They will call you.

       "  128: '[Ive written before on 10 reasons Parents Should Not Send Their Kids to College and here is also Eight Alternatives to College but its occurred to me that the place where college has really hurt me the most was when it came to the real world, real life, how to make money, how to build a business, and then even how to survive when trying to build my business, sell it, and be happy afterwards. Here are the ten things that if I had learned them in college I probably wouldve saved/made millions of extra dollars, not wasted years of my life, and maybe wouldve even saved lives because I wouldve been so smart I wouldve been like an X-Man.1. How to Program - I spent $100,000 of my own money (via debt, which I paid back in full) majoring in Computer Science. I then went to graduate school in computer science. I then remained in an academic environment for several years doing various computer programming jobs. Finally I hit the real world. I got a job in corporate America. Everyone congratulated me where I worked, youre going to the real world, they said. I was never so happy. I called my friends in NYC, money is falling from trees here, they said. I looked for apartments in Hoboken. I looked at my girlfriend with a new feeling of gratefulnesswe were going to break up once I moved. I knew it.In other words, life was going to be great. My mom even told me, youre going to shine at your new job.Only one problem: when I arrived at the job, after 8 years of learning how to program in an academic environmentI couldnt program. I wont get into the details. But I had no clue. I couldnt even turn on a computer. It was a mess. I think I even ruined peoples lives while trying to do my job. I heard my boss whisper to his bosss boss, I dont know what were going to do with him, he has no skills. And whats worse is that I was in a cluster of cubicles so everyone around me could hear that whisper also.So they sent me to two months of remedial programming courses at AT&amp;T in New Jersey. If youve never been in an AT&amp;T complex its like being a stormtrooper learning how to go to the bathroom in the Death Star where, inconceivably, in six Star Wars movies there is no evidence of any bathrooms. Seriously, you couldnt find a bathroom in these places. They were mammoth but if you turned down a random corner then, whallah!there might be an arts &amp; crafts show. The next corner would have a display of patents, like how to eliminate static on a phone line  1947. But I did finally learn how to program.I know this because I ran into a guy I used to work with ten years ago who works at the same place I used to work at. Man, he says, they still use your code. And I was like, really? Yeah, he said, because its like spaghetti and nobody can figure out how to modify it or even replace it.So, everything I dedicated my academic career to was flushed down the toilet. The last time I programmed a computer was 1999. It didnt work. So I gave up. Goodbye C++. I hope I never see you and your objects again.2. How to Be Betrayed. A girlfriend about 20 years ago wrote in her diary. I wish James would just die. That would make this so much easier. Whenever I kiss him Im thinking of X. Where X was a good friend of mine. Of course I put up with it. We went out for several more months. Its just a diary, right? She didnt really mean it! I mean, cmon. Who would think about someone else when kissing my beautiful face? I confronted her of course. She said, why would you read through my personal items? Which was true! Why would I? Dont have I have any personal items of my own I could read through? Or a good book, for instance, to take up my time and educate myself? Kiss, kiss, kiss.Why cant they have a good college course called BETRAYAL 101. I can teach it. Topics we will cover: Betrayal by a business partner, betrayal by investors, betrayal by a girlfriend (Id bring in a special lecturer to talk about betrayal by men, kind of like how Gwynneth Paltrow does it in Glee), betrayal by children (since they cleverly push the boundaries right at the limit of betrayal and you have to know when to recognize that theyve stepped over the line, betrayal by friends/family (note to all the friends/family that think I am talking about them, I am notthis is a serious academic proposal about what needs to be taught in college)you help them, then get betrayed  how to deal with that?Then there are the more subtle issues of betrayal  self-sabotage. How you can make enough money to live forever and then repeatedly find yourself in soup kitchens, licking envelopes, attending 12 step meetings, taking medications, and finally reaching some sort of spiritual recognition that it all doesnt matter until the next time you sink even lower. This might be in BETRAYAL 201. Or graduate level studies. I dont know. Maybe the Department of Defense needs to give me a grant to work on this since thats who funds much of our education.3. Oh shoot, I was going to put Self-Sabotage into a third category and not make it a sub-category of How to Be Betrayed. Hmmm, how do I write myself out of this conundrum. College, after all, does teach one how to put ideas into a cohesive report that is handed in and graded. Did I form my thesis, argue it correctly, conclude correctly, not diverge into things like Kim Kardashian will never be the betrayer, only the betrayed. But this brings me to: Writing. Why cant college teach people how to actually write. Some of my best friends tell me college taught them how to think. Thinking has a $200,000 price tag apparently and there is no room left over for good writing.And what is good writing? Its not an opinion. Or a rant. Or a thesis with logical steps, a deep cavern underneath, beautiful horizons and mountaintops at the top. Its blood. Its Carrie-style blood. Where everyone has been fooling you until that exact moment when now, with the psychic power of the written word, you spray pig blood everywhere, at everyone, and most of all you are covered in blood yourself, the same blood that pushed you out of your mothers womb, until just the act of writing itself is a birth, a separation between the old you and the new youthe you that can no longer take the words back, the words that now must live and breathe and mature and either make something of themselves in life, or remain one of the little blips that reminds us of how small we really are in an infinite universe. (See also, 33 Unusual Tips to Be a Better Writer)4. Dinner Parties. How come I never learned about dinner parties in college. Sure, there were parties among other people who looked like me and talked like me and thought like me other college students of my age and rough background. But Dinner Parties as an adult are a whole new beast. There are drinks and snacks beforehand where small talk has to disguise itself as big talk and then theres the parts where you know that everyone is equally worried about what people think about them but that still doesnt help at those moments when you talk and you wonder what did people think of me? Nobody cares, you tell yourself, intellectually rifling through pages of self-help blogs in your mind that told you that nobody gives a sh*t about you. But still, why dont we have a class where theres Dinner Party after Dinner Party and you learn how to talk at the right moments, say smart things, be quiet at the right moments, learn to excuse yourself during the mingling so you can drift from person to person. Learn how to interrupt a conversation without being rude. Learn how to thank the host so you can be invited to the next party. And so on. Which brings me to:5. Networking. Did it really take 20 years after I graduated college before someone wrote a book, Never Eat Alone. Why didnt Jesus write that book. Or Plato. Then we mightve read it in religious school or it wouldve been one of those big Thinkers we need to read in college so we can learn how to think. I still dont know how to network properly so this paragraph is small. Im classified under the DSM VI as a social shut-in. Id like to get out and be social but when the moment comes, I can only make it out the door about one in ten times. I always say, Id love to get together but then I dont know how to do it. Perhaps because not one dollar of my $100,000 spent on not learning how to program a computer was also not spent on learning how to network with people. (See also, \"9 Ways to be a Super-Connector\")6. Politics. My very first girlfriend, the girl who first laughed hysterically when I showed her a piece of chewing gum I found on the ground that had sculpted itself into the muddy shape of a heart, took me to a movie called Salvador. Then there was a discussion group afterwards about how the Contras are bad, or good, I forget, and everyone was nodding and speaking in a Spanish accent. And afterwards my girlfriend was upset, why arent you talking? Because truth was I was so tired I couldnt think but nobody ever taught me how to tell the truth so I lied and said, it moved me so much Im still absorbing it and my girlfriend said, yeah, I can see that. And nobody ever taught me that theres more than one acceptable opinion on a college campus.My roommate for instance would tell me, Reagan is definitely getting impeached this time. And I visited his dads mansion over Christmas break and he told me all about Trotskyism and the proletariat and I had to work jobs 40 hours a week while taking six courses so I could A) graduate early and B) pay my personal expenses and when I would run into him he had long hair and would nod about how a lot of the college workers (but not the lowest-paid, poorest treated onesthe students who worked) were thinking of unionizing and he was helping with that. Do you have a job? I asked and he said, no time. And thats politics in college.What about the real politics of how people try to backstab you at the corporate workplace or VCs never properly explained the ratchet concept to you before they kicked you out of the company and then re-financed. Nobody told me a thing about that in three years of college and two years of graduate school. I wish I wouldve known that for my $100,000.7. Failure. Goes without saying they dont teach you this. If you are going to pay $100,000, why would you fail? You might think you were wasting your money if the first mandatory elective you had to take was about failure. About wondering how you were going to feed your family after you got fired when something that was not your fault: Post-Traumatic-Lehman-Stress Syndrome, a common medical condition coming up in the DSM VII.8. Sales. When I was busy learning how to not program nobody ever taught me how to sell what it was I was programming. Or sell myself. Or sell out. Or sell my ideas and turn them into money. Or sell a product to someone who might need it. Or even better, sell it to someone who doesnt need it. Some business programs might have courses on salesmanship but those are BS because everyone automatically gets As in MBA programs so that the schools can demonstrate what good jobs their students get so they then get more applicants and the scam/cycle continues. But sales: how to demonstrate passion behind an idea you had, you built, you signed up for, so that people are willing to pay hard-earned after-tax money for it, is the number one key to any success and I have never seen it taught (properly) in college.9. Negotiation. Youve gotten the idea, you executed, you made the sale and nowwhats the price. What part of your body will be amputated in exchange for infinite wisdom. Will you give up one eye? Or your virility? Because something has to go if you are up against a good negotiator? What? You already thought (like most people without any experience do) that you were already a good negotiator. A good negotiator will skin your back, tattoo it with SUCKA and hang it up above the fireplace in his pool house if you dont know what you are doing. The funny thing is, the best sales people (who are just aiming for people to say Yes!) are often the worst negotiators (its very hard to say No when you are trying to get people to Yes). These are things I wish I had learned in school. Ive been beaten in negotiations on at least five different occasions, which fortunately became five valuable lessons Ive learned the hard way, instead of studying examples and being forced to think about it for the $100k in debt I got going to college.People will say, well, thats your experience in college. Mine was very different. And its true. You joined the sororities and learned how to network and dinner party and be political and know everything there is to know about betrayal. My college experience was sadly unique and probably different from everyone elses so you would be completely right to quote me that inane statistic about how college graduates earn 4% more than high school graduates and are consequently 4% happier .(Another thing, 10. Happiness. We never learn how its a combination of the food we eat, our health, our ability to be creative, our ability to have sound emotional relationships, our ability to find something bigger than ourselves and our egos to give up our spiritual virginity to.)So I can tell you what I wish I did. I wish I had gone to Soviet Russia, and played chess, and then gone to India and learned yoga and health, and I wish I had gone to South America and volunteered for kids with no arms, and did any number of things. But people then say, haha! but that cost money. And they would be right. It would cost less than $100,000+ but would still cost some money. I have no idea how much.But one of these days when the scars of college go away and I truly learn how to think. I might have better comebacks for these people. Or if I truly learn, I would learn not to care at all. (Photo credit: University of Exeter)]',\n",
       "  129: '[It is not easy for me to be honest. I grew up thinking I had to lie to people to get them to like me.I needed to somehow be someone I wasnt in order to burn away invisible scars that I was sure everyone could see.I thought I had to, for instance, get into a good college for people to like me. Or be a chess master. Or even have straight hair. Or get rid of my glasses. Or acne. Or have a lot of money.These were all lies I told myself because I didnt think I could be liked without these medals shining bright off my shirt.Then there were lies I told others. I told the first girl I ever went out with that I once stole a lot of money from my parents and lost it all gambling on horses.Then her dad came to visit and he heard all about my race track adventures. So he said, Lets all go to the horse track! I had never even been to the race track before.So we went and I had no idea what I was doing and it was pretty clear that I had lied to her, like I did on many occasions before that and even after that until there was nothing left of us.The truth is: I did steal money from my parents. But I spent it all on going to movies and buying comic books and books about chess. And I would use the money to skip school and go into New York and hang out in Washington Square Park playing chess with everyone there.Not an exciting enough story, though, to tell a girl who wanted me to confess all sorts of things to show her what an outlaw I was instead of a Jewish suburban middle class kid.Then theres the lies I told as I went from job to job. Skills maybe I had 10% of but I claimed 100% of. A salary that I would enhance by a few thousand so when I got an offer Id make a few thousand more. Titles I had at old jobs that never even existed.Then later I wouldnt tell people I was getting a divorce. Or losing a home. Or losing hope.Why did I tell the lies to others?I never thought I was good enough for anything. And I always wanted more of it. If I could just get to the 4th rung on the ladder, I was sure the 5th rung had my name on it.And even though I was sweating, hungry, unhappy, scared, I knew if I just reached that 5th rung Id be happy. That the prize was waiting for me there.So Id lie to get it.Everyone would forgive me then. Everyone would pat me on the back and have a big meeting and all say, we knew you could do it.Girls who had broken up with me would claim they were only testing me, that they were also waiting for this moment. They would be side by side with the bosses that fired me. The people who had ignored me. All of them together in a big party to celebrate me.They would all be happy, laughing and slapping me on the back.I wouldnt believe it.How did they all know each other? Here they all were  loving me, because now I had finally gotten to the point where I didnt have to lie to them anymore.But I never reached that rung on the ladder. And I never will.I fell off the ladder.A few months ago I had breakfast with the CEO of a company I once worked for. They had fired me and then withheld a bonus payment I had desperately needed.But they had since changed CEOs several times and now I was meeting their latest CEO who had reached out to me.It was around the time they withheld that payment that I realized nobody out there at all was going to help me. Nobody would be fair. This wasnt a blame thing. Nor was it pessimism.I just needed to pick myself up and its my own fault for not dealing with good people. For not constantly being creative. For not feeling grateful.But in order to be around good people, I also had to be a good person, not an imaginary one.I had to feel abundant without lying about it in order to have abundance hit me. Not in a law of attraction way, but just so I could sleep at night.It was that simple. I had to stop using all the energy in my brain coming up with imaginary futures. The brain is too powerful and needs a lot of fuel to keep the lies going.Better to use that fuel for being happy and good now than to make up futures and anxieties and regrets.The CEO told me, I heard you had a heart attack or a nervous breakdown a few years ago. Thats what everyone told me.I couldnt believe what she said. To me I had just had the most fulfilling and successful few years of my life.But to the people who knew me, to people looking in from the outside, it appeared to be a nervous breakdown, as every facade fell away. I had been buried in my lies and now I no longer was.No, I told her, Ive been healthier than I had ever been.She repeated it, Everyone insists you had at least a nervous breakdown.Maybe I did. But I wasnt nervous. I wasnt broke. And I wasnt down.Anymore. (Photo by: WhatWhat)]',\n",
       "  130: '[If you Google entrepreneur you get a lot of mindless cliches like Think Big! For me, being an entrepreneur doesnt mean starting the next Faceook. Or even starting any business at all. It means finding the challenges you have in your life, and determining creative ways to overcome those challenges. However, in this post I focus mostly on the issues that come up when you first start your company. These rules also apply if you are taking an entrepreneurial stance within a much larger company (which all employees should do).Just as good to be an entreployee as an entrepreneur. Either one will help you survive this world of increased economic uncertainty.(This is BS)For me, Ive started several businesses.Maybe 17 have failed out of 20. I fail quickly. I fail frequently. Entrepreneurship is a sentence of failures punctuated by brief success.Im invested in about 28 private companies. Ive advised probably another 50 private companies. Im on the board of several private companies and one public company. The companies ranging from $0 in revenues to a billion in revenues.Along the way Ive compiled a list of rules that have helped me deal with every aspect of being an entrepreneur in business and some in life.Heres the real rules:A)  Its not fun. Im not going to explain why its not fun. These are rules. Not theories. I dont need to prove them.But theres a strong chance you can hate yourself throughout the process of being an entrepreneur. Keep sharp objects and pills away during your worst moments. And you will have them. If you are an entrepreneur and agree with me, please note this in the comments below.B)  Try not to hire people. Youll have to hire people to expand your business. But its a good discipline to really question if you need each and every hire.C)  Get a customer. This seems obvious. But its not. Get a customer before you start your business, if you can. (see, the Easiest Way to Succeed as an Entrepreneur).So many people say to me, I have an idea. Can you introduce me to VCs?There is a HUGE gap between idea and professional venture capital.In the middle of that gap is customer.D)  If you are offering a service, call it a product.Oracle did it. They claimed they had a database. But if you bought their database they would send in a team of consultants to help you install the database to fit your needs.In other words, for the first several years of their existence, they claimed to have a product but they really were a consulting company. Dont forget this story. Products are valued higher than services.And almost EVERY major software product company was a service company in the beginning. Dont forget that.E)  Its OK to fail. Start over. Hopefully before you run out of money. Hopefully before you take in investor money. Or, dont worry about it. Come up with new ideas. Start over.F) Be profitable. Try to be profitable immediately. This seems obvious but it isnt. Try not to raise money. That money is expensive.G) When raising money: if its not easy then your idea is probably incapable of raising money. If its easy, then take as much as possible. If its TOO easy, then sell your company (unless you are Twitter, etc).(if its too easy, sell your company)H) The same goes for selling your company. If its not easy, then you need to build more. Then sell. To sell your company, start getting in front of your acquirers a year in advance. Send them monthly updates describing your progress. Then, when they need a company like yours, your company is the first one that comes to mind.Dont be like that guy in the TV show Silicon Valley. If someone offers you ten million for a company that has no revenues, then sell it. Not everything is going to be a Facebook. And even the Google guys tried to sell their company for ONE MILLION DOLLARS to Yahoo before they were revenue positive.SELL THE COMPANY.I) Competition is good. It turns you into a killer. It helps you judge progress. It shows that other people value the space you are in. Your competitors are also your potential acquirors.J) Dont use a PR firm. Except maybe as a secretary. You are the PR for your company. You are your companys brand. You personally.Ive never had a good PR company. Ive had good PR secretaries. But they are cheaper. One time I hired a PR company and they accidentally sent me the contract for Terry Bradshaw. He was paying $10,000 a month. How did they do for him?K) Communicate with everyone. Employees. Customers. Investors. All the time. Every day.Employees want to know what to do. And they want to know you are thinking of their overall career.Customers want to know how to keep their bosses calm.Investors want to be your friend and want to know they can count on you when times are tough.L)  Do everything for your customers. This is very important.Get them girlfriends or boyfriends. Speak at their charities. Visit their parents for Thanksgiving. Help them find other firms to meet their needs. Even introduce them to your competitors if you think a competitor can help them or if you think you are about to be fired. Always think first, Whats going to make my customer happy?Note: EVEN if that means introduce them to a competitor. If you are the SOURCE, then everybody comes back to the source.M) Your customer is not a company. Theres a human there. What will make my human customer happy? Make him laugh. You want your customer to be happy.N) Show up. Go to breakfast/lunch/dinner with customers. Treat.O) History. Know the history of your customers in every way. Company history, personal history, marketing history, investing history, etc.P) Micro-manage software development. Nobody knows your product better than you do. If you arent a technical person, learn how to be very specific in your product specification so that your programmers cant say: well you didnt say that!Q) Hire local. You need to be able to see and talk to your programmers. Dont outsource to India. I love India. But I wont hire programmers from there while Im living in the US.R) Sleep. Dont buy into the 20 hours a day entrepreneur myth. You need to sleep 8 hours a day to have a focused mind.If you are working 20 hours a day, then that means you have flaws in how you are managing your time. You can argue about this but its true.S) Exercise. Same as above. If you are unhealthy, your product will be unhealthy.T) Emotionally Fit. DONT have dating problems and software development problems at the same time. VCs will smell this all over you.U) Pray. You need to. Be grateful where you are. And pray for success. You deserve it. Pray for the success of your customers. Heck, pray for the success of your competitors. The better they do, it means the market is getting bigger. And if one of them breaks out, they can buy you.V)  Buy your employees gifts. Massages. Tickets. Whatever. I always imagined that at the end of each day my young, lesbian employees (for some reason, most employees at my first company were lesbian) would be calling their parents and their mom and dad would ask them: Hi honey! How was your day today? And I wanted them to be able to say: It was the best! Invite customers to masseuse day.W) Treat your employees like they are your children. They need boundaries. They need to be told no! sometimes. And sometimes you need to hit them in the face (ha ha, just kidding). But within boundaries, let them play.X) Dont be greedy pricing your product. If your product is good and you price it cheap, people will buy. Then you can price upgrades, future products, and future services more expensive. Which goes along with the next rule.Y) Distribution is everything. Branding is everything. Get your name out there, whatever it takes. The best distribution is of course word of mouth, which is why your initial pricing doesnt matter.Write a blog about your industry and be very honest about all the flaws (even your own) that is currently in your industry.Authenticity is the best branding.Z) Dont kill yourself. Its not worth it. Your employees need you. Your children or future children need you. It seems odd to include this in a post about entrepreneurship but were also taking about keeping it real. Most books or rules for entrepreneurs talk about things like think big, go after your dreams. But often dreams turn into nightmares. Ill repeat it again. Dont kill yourself. Call me if things get too stressful. Or more importantly, make sure you take proper medicationAA) Give employees structure. Let each employee know how his or her path to success can be achieved. All of them will either leave you or replace you eventually. Thats OK. Give them the guidelines how that might happen. Tell them how they can get rich by working for you.BB) Fire employees immediately. If an employee gets the disease he needs to be fired. If they ask for more money all the time. If they bad mouth you to other employees. If you even think they are talking behind your back, fire them.The disease has no cure. And its very contagious. Show no mercy. Show the employee the door. There are no second chances because the disease is incurable.I dont say this because I want anyone to be hurt. But if youve followed the rules above then you are treating employees well already. NOBODY should spread the disease and badmouth you or your customers.CC) Make friends with your landlord. If you ever have to sell your company, believe it or not, you are going to need his signature (because theres going to be a new lease owner)DD) Only move offices if you are so packed in that employees are sharing desks and theres no room for people to walk.EE) Have killer parties. But use your personal money. Not company money. Invite employees, customers, and investors. Its not the worst thing in the world to also invite off duty prostitutes or models.I dont say this in a sexist way. Its just the reality of what happens with every company in the world.FF) If an employee comes to you crying, close the door or take him or her out of the building. Sit with him until it stops. Listen to what he has to say. If someone is crying then theres been a major communication breakdown somewhere in the company. Listen to what it is and fix it. Dont get angry at the culprits. Just fix the problem.(you dont want your employees to be sad.)GG) At Christmas, donate money to every customers favorite charity. But not for investors or employees.HH) Have lunch with your competitors. Listen and try not to talk. One competitor (Bill Markel from Interactive 8) once told me a story about how the CEO of Toys R Us returned his call. He was telling me this because I never returned Bills calls. Ok, Bill, lesson noted.II) Ask advice a lot. Ask your customers advice on how you can be introduced into other parts of their company. Then they will help you. Because of the next ruleJJ) Hire your customers. Or not. But always leave open the possibility. Let it always dangle in the air between you and them. They can get rich with you. Maybe. Possibly. If they play along. So play.KK) On any demo or delivery, do one extra surprise thing that was not expected. Always add bells and whistles that the customer didnt pay for.This is such an easy way to over deliver Im surprised people dont do it 100% of the time. They do it maybe 1% of the time. So this is an easy way to compete and surprise and delight.LL) Understand the demographic changes that are changing the world. Where are marketing dollars flowing and can you be in the middle. What services do aging baby boomers need? Is the world running out of clean water? Are newspapers going to survive? Etc. Etc. Read every day to understand what is going on.LLa) Dont go to a lot of parties or meetups with other entrepreneurs. Work instead while they are partying.MM) But, going along with the above rule, dont listen to the doom and gloomers that are hogging the TV screen trying to tell you the world is over. They just want you to be scared so they can scoop up all the money.NN) You have no more free time. In your free time you are thinking of new ideas for customers, new ideas for services to offer, new products.OO) You have no more free time, part 2. In your free time, think of ideas for potential customers. Then send them emails: I have 10 ideas for you. Would really like to show them to you. I think you will be blown away. Heres five of them right now.OOa) Depressions, recessions, dont matter. Theres $15 trillion in the economy. Youre allowed a piece of it:FedEx, Microsoft, HewlettPackard, and many huge companies were started in recessions or depressions. Leave economics to the academics while they leave good business to you.PP) Talk. Tell everyone you ever knew what your company does. Your friends will help you find clients.QQ) Always take someone with you to a meeting. Youre bad at following up. Because you have no free time. So, if you have another employee. Let them follow up. Plus, they will like to spend time with the boss. Youre going to be a mentor.RR) If you are consumer focused: your advertisers are your customers. But always be thinking of new services for your consumers. Each new service has to make their life better. Peoples lives are better if: they become healthier, richer, or have more sex. Health can be broadly defined.SS) If your customers are advertisers: find sponsorship opportunities for them that drive customers straight into their arms. These are the most lucrative ad deals (see rule above). Ad inventory is a horrible business model. Sponsorships are better. Then you are talking to your customer.TT) No friction. The harder it is for a consumer to sign up, the less consumers you will have. No confirmation emails, sign up forms, etc. The easier the better.TTA) No fiction, part 2. If you are making a website, have as much content as you can on the front page. You dont want people to have to click to a second or third page if you can avoid it. Stuff that first page with content. You arent Google.  (And, 10 Unusual Things You Didnt Know About Google)UU) No friction, part 3. Say yes to any opportunity that gets you in a room with a big decision maker. Doesnt matter if it costs you money.VV) Sell your company two years before you sell it. Get in the offices of the potential buyers of your company and start updating them on your progress every month. Ask their advice on a regular basis in the guise of just an industry catch-upWW) If you sell your company for stock, sell the stock as soon as you can. If you are selling your company for stock it means:\\na. The market is such that lots of companies are being sold for stock.\\nb. AND, companies are using stock to buy other companies because they value their stock less than they value cash.\\nc. WHICH MEANS, that when everyones lockup period ends, EVERYONE will be selling stock across the country. So sell yours first.\\nXX) Execution is a dime a dozen. If you have an idea worth pursuing, then just make it. You can build any website for cheap. Hire a programmer and make a demo. Get at least one person to sign up and use your service. If you want to make Facebook pages for plumbers, find one plumber who will give you $10 to make his Facebook page. Just do it.Fail quickly. Good ideas are HARD. Its execution that is a dime a dozen.YY) Dont use a PR firm, part II. Set up a blog. Tell your personal stories (see 33 tips to being a better writer ). Let the customer know you are human, approachable, and have a real vision as to why they need to use you. Become the voice for your industry, the advocate for your products. If you make skin care products, tell your customers every day how they can be even more beautiful than they currently are and have more sex than they are currently getting. Blog your way to PR success. Be honest and bloody.ZZ) Dont save the world. If your product sounds too good to be true, then you are a liar.ZZa) Your company is always for sale.AAA) Frame the first check. Im staring at mine right now.BBB) No free time, part 3. Pick a random customer. Find five ideas for them that have nothing to do with your business. Call them and say, Ive been thinking about you. Have you tried this?CCC) No resale deals. Nobody cares about reselling your service. Those are always bad deals.DDD) Your lawyer or accountant is not going to introduce you to any of their other clients. Those meetings are always a waste of time.EEE) Celebrate every success. Your employees need it. They need a massage also. Get a professional masseuse in every Friday afternoon. Nobody leaves a job where there is a masseuse.FFF) Sell your first company. I have to repeat this. Dont take any chances. You dont need to be Mark Zuckerberg. Sell your first company as quick as you can. You now have money in the bank and a notch on your belt. Make a billion on your next company.Note Mark Cubans story. Before he started Broadcast.com and rode it to a few billion, he sold his first software company for ten million.GGG) Pay your employees before you pay yourself.HHH) Give equity to get the first customer. If you have no product yet and no money, then give equity to a good partner in exchange for them being a paying customer. Note: dont blindly give equity. If you develop a product that someone asked for, dont give them equity. Sell it to them. But if you want to get a big distribution partner whose funds can keep you going forever, then give equity to nail the deal.III) Dont worry about anyone stealing your ideas. Ideas are worthless anyway. Its OK to steal something thats worthless.IIIA) Follow me on twitter.Questions from ReadersQuestion: You say no free time but you also say keep emotionally fit, physically fit, etc. How do I do this if Im constantly thinking of ideas for old and potential customers?Answer: Its not easy or everyone would be rich.Question: if I get really stressed about clients paying, how do I get sleep at night?Answer: medicationQuestion: how do I cold-call clients?Answer: email them. Email 40 of them. Its OK if only 1 answers. Email 40 a day but make sure you have something of value to offer.Question: how can I find cheap programmers or designers?Answer: if you dont know any and you want to be cheap: use scriptlance.com, elance.com, or craigslist. But dont hire them if they are from another country. You need to communicate with them even if it costs more money.Question: should I hire programmers?Answer: firstfreelance. Then hire.Question: what if I build my product but Im not getting customers?Answer: develop a service loosely based on your product and offer that to customers. But I hope you didnt make a product without talking to customers to begin with?Question: I have the best idea in the world, but for it to work it requires a lot of people to already be using it. Like Twitter.Answer: if youre not baked into the Silicon Valley ecosystem, then find distribution and offer equity if you have to. Zuckerberg had Harvard. MySpace had the fans of all the local bands they set up with MySpace pages. I (in my own small way) had Thestreet.com when I set up Stockpickr.com. I also had 10 paying clients when i did my first successful business fulltime.Question: I just lost my biggest customer and now I have to fire people. Ive never done this before. How do I do it?Answer: one on meetings. Be Kind. State the facts. Say you have to let people go and that everyone is hurting but you want to keep in touch because they are a great employee. It was an honor to work with them and when business comes back you hope you can convince them come back. Then ask them if they have any questions. Your reputation and the reputation of your company are on the line here. You want to be a good guy. But you want them out of your office within 15 minutes. Its a termination, not a negotiation. This is one reason why its good to start with freelancers.Question: I have a great idea. How do I attract VCs?Answer: build the product. Get a customer. Get money from customer. Get more customers. Build more services in the product. Get VC. Chances are by this point, the VCs are calling you.Question: I want to build a business day trading.Answer: bad ideaQuestion: I want to start a business but dont know what my passion is:Answer: skip to the post: How to be the luckiest person alive. Do the Daily Practice. Within six months your life will be completely different.Question: I want to leave my job but Im scared.Answer: same as above question. The Daily Practice turns you into a healthy Idea Machine. Plus luck will flow in from every direction.Final rule: Things change. Every day. The title of this post, for instance, says 100 Rules. But I gave about 70 rules (including the Q&amp;A). Things change midway through. Be ready for it every day. In fact, every day figure out what you can change just slightly to shake things up and improve your product and company.Your business is not your life. When you start a business you also get a cognitive bias that makes you think your business is GREAT.Every day make sure you are not smoking crack. The most important thing is your health so you can be persistent. If you smoke crack you can die.I hope you succeed. Because I really need that smart toilet that sends my doctors text messages after doing urinalysis on my pee every day.Good luck.

       "  131: \"[When I was twelve years old I had one purpose in life. I wanted to be a Colonel. And not just any colonel. I wanted to be an Honorary Colonel in the Kentucky State Militia. Just like my hero  Colonel Sanders. I had to start off slow  Kentucky was the glamor state to be a colonel of. First I started off with Mississippi. I called the governor, Cliff Finch, and interviewed him because for some reason that I still cant figure out he was running in the primaries for President against another former Southern governor, incumbent President, Jimmy Carter.Cliff Finch invited me down to Mississippi. His campaign and my dad split my air fare, about 60 dollars each. It was the first time I had ever been in a plane and I was scared. When I landed everything looked the same but people talked differently. It was a weird feeling. As if I had landed in an alternative universe. The main things I remember from that trip was getting the certificate that made me an honorary colonel of the state (I better get an 18 gun salute the next time I fly there!), presenting to Governor Finch how he would the youth vote, and a lot of people asking me what it was like to be Jewish.Then I wrote to the governor of Alabama and I said my family was moving to Alabama, I had read everything about Alabama and I loved the state and now I wanted to be a colonel there. The governor there sent me back a huge certificate: James Altucher was now a lieutenant colonel in the Alabama State Militia. With Texas I became an honorary citizen. With North Carolina I became an honorary tarheel. But with Kentucky, I couldnt crack the code. They knew how valuable their colonelship was. They needed references, background checks, etc. I was twelve years old and decided for the first of many times to quit while I was ahead. Still, if anyone wants to call me Colonel (MIssissippi) Im totally fine with that.Which brings me to an important point. Probably the most important person in Kentucky history is Harlan Sanders, the man himself, the colonel, the inventor of Kentucky Fried Chicken, one of the most successful franchise operations in history. Extra crispy kentucky fried chicken still has to be one of the best foods on the planet. You might get sick afterwards but who cares. Buddha says live in the now!A lot of people say to me, Im 25 years old and still have no idea what my purpose in life should be. When Colonel Sanders was 25 he still had yet to be a fireman, a street car conductor, a farmer, a steamboat operator, and finally he ran a service station where he sold chicken. The chicken was great and people love it but he didnt start making real money until he started franchising at the age of 65. Thats the age he was when he found his purpose in life.I dont like the word purpose. It implies that somewhere in the future I will find something that will make me happy. And until then I will be unhappy. People fool themselves into thinking that the currency of unhappiness will buy them happiness. That we have to pay our dues, go on some sort of ride, and then get dropped off at a big location called our purpose where now we can be happy.It doesnt work that way.You can find the tools to be happy right now. I still dont know what my purpose is. Im afraid I will never know. That makes me very happy. Maybe I can have lots of adventures between today and the day I die. Maybe I can do lots of different things. And if I don't  if I die even tomorrow  thats fine also. What does purpose mean when we are dead? We might as well choose to be happy now.Other people who found success after changing many careers: Rodney Dangerfield didnt succeed in comedy until his 40s. One of the funniest guys ever, he was an aluminum siding salesman. And then he had to start his own comedy club, Dangerfields, in order to actually perform as a comedian. He chose himself to succeed! But not until his 40s.Ray Kroc was a milkshake salesman into his 50s. Then he stumbled onto a clean restaurant that served a good hamburger run by two brothers with the last name McDonald. He bought McDonalds when he was 52.Henry Miller wrote his first big novel, Tropic of Cancer, at age 40.(Anais Nin was considered Henry Millers muse but I much prefer her diaries to his books)Raymond Chandler, the most successful noir novelist of all time, wrote his first novel at age 52. But he was young compared with Frank McCourt, who won the Pulitzer for his first novel, Angelas Ashes, written when he was 66. And, of course, Julia Child was a young 50 when she wrote her first cookbook.One of my favorite writers of all time: Stan Lee, created the entire universe for which he is known for: the Marvel Universe, when he was 44, inventing the characters Spiderman, The Fantastic Four, the Avengers, etc.If you dont like to kill people but still need a weapon, consider the Taser, invented by Jack Cover when he was 50. He didnt sell a single one until he was 60.If you like restaurant reviews you might have read Zagats. Started by Tim Zagat who quit his job as a lawyer in order to create the book of reviews when he was 51.Harry Bernstein was a total failure when he wrote his best selling memoir, The Invisible Wall. His prior 40 (Forty!) novels had been rejected by publishers. When his memoir came out he was 93 years old.A quote from him: If I had not lived until I was 90, I would not have been able to write this book,God knows what other potentials lurk in other people,if we could only keep them alive well into their 90.Peter Roget was a mediocre doctor who was finally forced to retire in his early 70s. But he became obsessed with words that have similar meanings. Was his purpose as a medical practitioner or as a guy who could play with words? Do you know him as a doctor or as the author of Rogets Thesaurus which he wrote when he was 73.When I was in college I ate Ramen noodles every day. One time in a grocery store a woman tried to tell me they were the worst thing I could eat. Really? Like worse than eating a brick, for instance? That was when I was 19. Now Im 45. It didnt hurt me that much that I ate Ramen noodles for an entire year because it was the only thing I could afford. If something costs 25 cents and has a few slivers of peas in it then its ok by me. Meanwhile, the inventor of Ramen noodles didnt invent it until he was 48 years old. Thank god for him!(I would have died of starvation if not for the guy who invented this).Charles Darwin was a little bit off by most standards. He liked to just collect plants and butterflies on remote islands in the Pacific. And then he wrote Origin of Species when he was 50.To top it all off, Henry Ford was a failure at his first Model T car, invented when he was 45, because he didnt yet have the productivity efficiencies of the assembly line, which he developed when he was 60.This is not meant to be inspirational. You might never have your great thing that you do. Im not even saying its the journey that one should love. Because some journeys are very painful. And nobody says you get special marks in death if you wrote a great novel at the age of 50. Or came up with a great chicken, or a way to stuff lots of people into factories.Ive stumbled and fallen and got up and survived enough that Im sick of goals and purposes and journeys. I want to cut out the middleman. The journey. The desperation and despair that thinking of a purpose entails. Its ok to not have a purpose.The word Gratitude equals Abundance. If every day you can be grateful for even the small things abundant in your life than you have reached achievement. Its a common myth that we have to pay our dues, sometimes for decades so we better start youror else!Unhappiness and stress are not the currencies of happiness.Meanwhile, Harlan Sanders made such a great chicken that even though he had barely made a dime off of it (that would happen 15 years later), at the tender age of 45 the Governor of Kentucky made Sanders an honorary colonel.Meanwhile, when I was 45 (Im 46 now), I also became an honorary colonel of Kentucky. So theres hope for anyone.* * *[For many more posts about purpose. and success, and life from James, sign up for his email list, because more articles are there.](Photo credits: Steve Webel for KFC; Ramen by William A.

       "  132: '[The woman right next to me was alive one second, then a taxi came up on the sidewalk of 42 Street between 6 and 7 Avenue, hit her and veered off and now the woman was lying in the street, blood everywhere. This happened on the first or second day of my work when I started at HBO. I tried to call 911 in the payphone (there were still payphones in August, 1994) and then I had to go. The woman was dead.And I had to go to work.I loved HBO like I would love a parent. I wanted them to approve of me. And kiss me as I went to sleep at night.(a more recent HBO show)Before I got the job offer to work there I would watch HBO all day long. My friend Peter and I would watch HBO or MTV for 10 hours straight. Id go over his house around 1pm in the afternoon and by 10pm we would look at each other and say, what the hell did we just do. Everything from the the Larry Sanders Show on HBO to Beavis &amp; Butthead on MTV. We couldnt stop. I loved the product. I wanted to work there.10 Rules If You Are Hired Today:[Related Posts:\\nHBO, Prostitutes, 3am, and the best job ever.\\nSign up for my email list for more posts about jobs. ]\\nRule #1: Love the product.You have to love the current output of the company. If you work at HBO, love the shows. Watch every single show. No excuses.If you work at WD-40, know every use of WD-40. Make up a few more that nobody ever thought of. If you work at Otis Elevators, understand all the algorithms for how it decides which floors to stop on when.If you work at Goldman Sachs, read every book on the history, study every deal theyve done, know Lloyd Blankfeins favorite hobbies and how he rose through the ranks. You have to love the product the way Derek Jeter loves playing baseball.When I started at HBO I would every day borrow VHS tapes from their library. I watched every show going ten years back. In my spare time Id stay late and watch TV. Id watch all the comedians. I even watched the boxing matches that initially made HBO famous. Which leads me toRule #2: Know the History. When the business I started, Reset, was acquired by a company called Xceed, I learned the history of the mini-conglomerate that Xceed was created out of. There was a travel agency for corporations. I visited them in California. There was a burn gel company. I visited them and met all the executives and learned the technical details how the gel was invented. There was a corporate incentives company. I met with them to see if any of their clients could become my clients.At HBO, I learned how Michael Fuchs (the head of HBO Sports at the time. Later CEO of HBO) in 1975 aired the first boxing match that went out on satellite. And how Jerry Levin (the CEO of HBO, later CEO of Time Warner) used satellites to send the signal out to the cable providers. The first time that had ever happened. Ted Turner had been so inspired by that he turned his local TV affiliate, TBS, into a national TV station, and the rest became history.Rule #3: Know the history of the executives. At HBO I studied the org chart religiously. My title was programmer analyst, IT department and yet I was always asking around: how did John Billock become head of Marketing (he trudged around house to house selling HBO subscriptions in Louisiana when Showtime started up, for instance, decades earlier).Where did my bosss bosss bosss boss work before arriving at HBO (Pepsi). Where did the head of Original Programming get his start? (he was a standup comedian, later CEO of HBO, before being forced to quit when choking his girlfriend in a Las Vegas parking lot). It was like reading about the origins of all the superheroes. I was a fanboy and my heroes were the other executives. I wanted to be one of them. Or better.Same thing: know all of your colleagues and what their dreams and ambitions are. Get to work 2 hours before they get to work. If they need favors, do them. You have a whole two hours extra a day. You can do anything.Rule #4: Make your boss look good. Your entire job in life is to make your boss look good. You dont care about yourself. You only want your boss to get promotions, raises, etc. Remember, you can never make more than your boss. So the more he makes, the better he does, the better you will do. Its the only way to rise up. Work hard, give him full credit for everything you do. Dont take an ounce of credit. At the end of the day, everyone knows where credit belongs. But even then, thank him for everything and direct all credit back to him (or her). Heres how you make your boss look good:\\nGet to work two hours before him. If that means you have to wake up and go in at 5am then do it. Two extra hours of work a day is an extra 500 hours of work a year. None of your co-workers can compete with that.\\nWalk with him to his car, train, etc when he leaves work. You need to know his goals, his initiatives, his plans, his family troubles, etc.\\nAnd, again, give him full credit for everything. And thank him regularly for the opportunity to do the work you are doing.\\nRule #5: Know all the secretaries. Its a clich but the secretaries run the company. They control all of the schedules. They dish out all of the favors. Take as many secretaries out to lunch as possible. Not just in your department but in every department.Particularly HR. HR knows all of the gossip. Knows everything that is happening. Its not so hard to do this. First off, HR gives you all of your intro material when you join the company. Ask those people out to lunch after youve settled in for a few weeks. If someone writes an internal company newsletter, ask that person to lunch. Ask your bosss bosss bosss bosss secretary out to lunch. Nobody will think you are going over their head. Youre asking to lunch just a secretary. This was invaluable to me at every company Ive ever worked at.Rule #6: Constantly test your value on the market. The job market is like any other market. Theres supply and demand. And youre just an item for sale at the great bazaar. Every year you need to find out what your value is on the market. For one thing, the best way to get an increase in salary and status is to move horizontally, not vertically. Second, you dont want to get inbred. A good friend of mine was in HBOs marketing department for 17 years. I set up a dinner between her, me, and the CEO of an advertising agency that was hiring. The CEO was one of my closest friends. Still, she couldnt hire my HBO friend. Shes too inbred, she said. She will never be able to get the HBO way of doing things out of her head.When I was at HBO I was constantly talking to people at other companies. I had lunch with top people at Showtime. I knew people from all the other divisions of Time Warner. I was always asking people to lunch of breakfast. I would get offers from the banking industry. I would try to work within different divisions of HBO. Everytime I got another offer, I got another raise and promotion at HBO. Sometimes substantial (up to 35% increases). My bosses would resent me for it, but then go back to Rule #4 and often they would get raises also.Rule #7: Study all the marketing campaigns. In 1996 they switched their slogan to Its not TV. Its HBO. That slogan lasted for 13 years. Before that it was Simply the Best, then Something Specials On. When they switched to Its not TV, Eric Kessler, the head of marketing, gave a talk on how they came up with the slogan. All his employees were in the auditorium. And me from the IT department. Nobody else would go with me. I knew every slogan HBO ever had.Rule #8: Study the industry. What made HBO different from Showtime. From Cinemax? From non-pay cable? From broadcasting. I ready every book about the history of TV I could find. I would go to lectures at the Museum of Radio and Television on 52 Street (the best was a day that members of the MTV show The Real World gave a panel. After the panel I followed one group of other people in the audience for 30 blocks while they talked about the panel and the show. I wanted to break in so many times. They would be my new best friends. We would have parties around showings of The Real World. But I was too shy and eventually they all split off in different directions, leaving me alone). Jessica Reif Cohen was the Merrill analyst covering media. I knew nothing about stocks. But I read everything she wrote and would scan the WSJ for mentions of her name.When I was trying to sell my first company, Reset. I called every company in the industry. Omnicom, Razorfish, Agency.com, etc etc. I read every SEC filing so I would know the nuances of all their deals and financings. When I was building Stockpickr I became obsessed with the mechanics of how Yahoo Finance worked and the ways in which she (Yahoo Finance is a she, and I love her) delivered traffic to all of her media sources. With HBO it was fascinating to me because at one point the CEOs of Showtime, Time Warner, Universal, Viacom, Fox Sports, etc were all former executives at HBO.(MTV\\'s \"Real World San Francisco\" was their best season)Rule #9: BECOME the company. I was a lowly programmer in the IT department. We were so far from the normal business operations of the company that they even put us in a different building. But that didnt matter to me. I WAS HBO. That was my mantra. I became so absorbed in every aspect of the company that I knew that any idea I had would be a good idea for the company. At least I felt this (not sure if anyone else did). I never said, I think this, I said, We should do this. HBO and I were a We. Inseparable. Until you have that feeling of unity with the company you work for, you cant rise up. Key, though: when you have an idea, make sure you know how to execute the idea also. In detail. Ideas are a dime a dozen. And execution is worth a million dollars. And I mean that specifically, if you execute on a good idea, youll make a million dollars or more from it.Rule #10. LEAVE. All good things must come to an end. From the day you start, you need to plan your exit. Not like in rule #6, Know Your Value where you are trying to figure out your corporate salary value. Leave means something different. It means youre going to say goodbye forever. If you master Rules #1-9 at a company then youll know enough about the company and industry to start your own company. To either become a competitor or a service provider. And you will have built in customers because your rolodex will be filled with people from the industry. If you constantly think like an entrepreneur from the instant you walk into your cubicle on day one of your job then you will constantly looking for those missing gaps you can fill. This is how you jump into the abyss. You make sure the abyss has a customer waiting for you.I did everything wrong my first few months at HBO. I didnt know NYC. I didnt know corporate culture at all. I wore the same suit five days in a row until I realized nobody else was wearing a suit and I never wore one again. I didnt have the requisite skill set to survive at my job (they had to send me to a remedial programming school despite the fact that I had majored in programming AND went to graduate school for computer science).I was obsessed with the Internet and HBO didnt even own HBO.com at the time. My bosss bosss boss would say to my boss, get him away from that Internet stuff and onto some real work.One time my boss came into my cubicle and with everyone listening from every other cubicle said to me, we want you to succeed here but you need to know more or else its not going to work out.It was very embarrassing and nobody around me would meet my eyes for the next week or so. I was the walking dead. I was sure I was going to get fired every day.But I survived then. And every day since.* * *[See my podcast for my interview with the movie director that gave away $50 million and moved into a trailer park].

       "  133: '[(Claudia mastering Flying) Are you satisfied with your life? Do you go to work knowing you could do better?Knowing there are unique talents in you that could make you great, the best in the world?This post is about achieving mastery. But also why its ok to not get mastery in the traditional sense. You can define it, not use the definitions provided by everyone else.In other words, its fine to be a loser.- - -There are a lot of books written on this topic. If you want to read an entire book on it, read Robert Greenes Mastery (or watch my podcast with him). Theres also Outliers by Malcom Gladwell.But its not that hard. It doesnt take a book to describe what makes a master. For one thing, most of us, and I mean me, will not be masters at anything.I try. I tried with chess. I hit the rank of master but that doesnt mean anything. Ill never be world class at it. Ive tried with writing. Ive been writing for twenty or so years.But Ive known a lot of people who are among the best in the world in their field. Ive read all the books. Ive talked to all the people and dissected what they thought led them to their mastery.Ive built and sold businesses to people who were masters of their fields in every industry. Ive invested in people who were masters in their fields.So Ive at least recognized who were masters and what they did.Take this then with a grain of salt but based on my experience and the experiences of all the people Ive interacted with.Here are the elements of mastery. I also have some good news and bad news.A) TALENT.I hate to say it, but talent is a factor.Theres a myth that everyone is talented at at least one thing and you just have to find it.This isnt true.Most people are not talented at anything. Most people can be pretty good at something. For instance, Tim Ferris shows in The Four Hour Chef how you can be a pretty good chef with four hours worth of work.Ive tried his techniques and in four hours I made some pretty good dishes. Thank you, Tim. But at the launch of Tims book he held a dinner where each course (I think there were eight of them) was cooked by a different chef.One of the chefs was (approximately) eight years old and his dish mightve been the best served. That kid will be a master one day if he isnt already. Thats talent.When my chess ranking was peaking back in 1997 I played in a tournament against a girl fittingly named Irina Krush.She really did crush me in about 25 moves. After the game she told me, May be your bishop to B4 move felt a little weak to me. She was right.She was 13 years old. I stopped playing chess in tournaments right that moment and now only play when Im on the phone with people. She had talent. Shes now one of the youngest women grandmasters in the world.B) HOW DO YOU FIND what you are talented at? I think there are roughly two methods.i) Take out a pad.List everything you enjoyed doing from the ages of six to eighteen, before your life was ruled by college, relationships, crappy jobs, mortgages, kids, responsibilities, self-loathing, etc.I was talking to Lewis Howes on my podcast. He mentioned he always wanted to be an athlete since he was a little kid.He also mentioned that he used networking skills to help himself out even at an early age in order to deal with what seemed like poor academic skills. He found his two talents and became masters at both.Often, its a combination of sub-talents that make you uniquely a master in that one field.For me, I dont know if I will master anything, but since I was a kid I loved writing, games, and anything to do with business. Maybe one day.ii) Go to the bookstore.Find a topic you would be willing to read 500 books on. If you cant wait to read all 500 books in the knitting section then you probably have a talent at knitting.Note that it is really ok to not be talented at anything. We werent put on this Earth to be talented at knitting.Do you know why we were put in this Earth? I hope you know, because then you could tell me. But chances are there really isnt any reason.We ultimately are a combination of all of our experiences, all of the things we are interested in, all of the things we flirt with. And that combination might look like garbage to everyone else.So play with your garbage and be happy. If you can do that, youre in the top 0.00001%.C) FOUR HOURS A DAY.Its not mystery Tim Ferrisss books all start with The Four Hour I ask almost every master I encounter, in every field, how much time per day do they spend mastering their field.They did not give the standard Silicon Valley BS Entrepreneur answer: I work 20 hours a day and if I didnt need to sleep Id work 30 hours a day.You cant get good at something if you are working 20 hours a day. In fact, something is very wrong in your life if that is how much you are working at ONE thing.The typical answer is: I study four hours a day. Anatoly Karpov, former World Chess Chamption, said the maximum he would study chess is three hours a day. Thats a guy who was a world champion.Then, when he wasnt in tournaments, hed spend the rest of the day exercising, studying languages, doing other things to balance out his life.D) HISTORY.In any area of life you want to succeed at, you have to study the history.All art is created in context. If someone wrote Beethovens Fifth Symphony right now it would be laughed at. It wouldnt fit the current context of music, even though it would be a work of genius.Andy Warhol tried many different areas of art before he decided that painting Campbells Soup Cans were the right art for the right moment in time.In any sport, studying the history of how previous world champions played and trained is critical towards figuring how you can improve on that training and playing.In any business, studying the history of that industry, the biographies of the prior executives, the successes and failures of those who went before you, is critical for mastering that business.For example, I had Greg Zuckerman on the podcast talking about the current resurgence in oil drilling in the US. Everyone thought the US was out of oil back in the 1970s.Well, now the fastest growing city in the United States is Williston, North Dakota and the US will probably be a net energy exporter by 2020. This is not a political opinion on fracking. Its just reality what is happening now.If I were remotely interested in fracking Id study where all the oil was drilled back in the 1920s, 1950s, 1970s. How the first wildcatters found their wells. What technologies were used. Whats the history of the technology. How were improvements made. Whats the history of the geopolitics around oil drilling. And so on. Somewhere in there there is a path to getting incredibly wealthy. Not for me, because I could care less about oil. But for someone. Or many.E) STUDY YOUR FAILURES.I was talking poker champ Ylon Schwartz. Hes won over $7mm in tournament winnings and untold millions in informal cash games. We grew up together playing chess until he made the switch first to backgammon and then poker.I asked him why a lot of people play poker for 20 years but never get better. Whats the story?He said, everyone wants to blame someone. They want to blame bad luck. Or they had a fight with their wife. Or something. But the key is you have to study your failures. You have to take notes about your losing hands and even your winning hands. You have to think about everything.We spoke about another friend of ours who went from homeless to millionaire in six months once he found that he had a knack for backgammon.His name was Falafel because at the time that was all he could afford to eat.Ylon told me, Falafel memorized every statistic about backgammon. Right now on the web you can see that his tournament games are ranked #1 in terms of how accurately they mimic a computer. Falafel also studied every single game he lost.I used to play Falafel every day in chess. Hed sleep on the ground in Washington Square Park and get up in the morning with dirt and leaves in his hair and wed play chess for fifty cents a game. Now million dollar bankrolls from backgammon are normal for him.F) EXPERIENCE.At some point you have to cook 10,000 meals. Or play a million hands of poker. Or 1000s of games of chess. Or start 20 businesses.Very few are successful right away. That would require too much luck and luck favors the prepared and the persistent.In those 1000s of whatever you will encounter much failure. We all know that the best baseball players in the world are enormous successes if they strike out only 70% of the time.When my dad died I went to his house and logged onto this chess account. I saw that he played about 30,000 games. He never got any better.A lot of people can play the 10,000 hands of poker and never get better. Or bake 1000 cakes and never get better.You have to remember your experiences, study your failures, try to note what you did right and what you did wrong, and remember them for future experiences.Will future experiences be exactly like the old experiences? Almost never.But you have to have the ability to say Hmm, this is like the time four years ago when X, Y, and Z happened.G) PATTERN RECOGNITIONBeing able to recognize when current circumstances are like an experience you had in the past or an experience SOMEONE ELSE youve studied had in the past is critical to mastery.Pattern recognition and mastery is a combination of all of the above: study + history + experience + talent + a new thingLove.H) LOVEAndre Agassi famously says he doesnt love tennis. I believe this and I dont believe it. We all know that there are all kinds of love. Theres unconditional love, which is very hard. The Dalai Lama can have unconditional love.Then theres lust. You look at someone and she is the Oomph to your Ugh. She is the BAM! to you BOOM! You dream and daydream and dream and daydream until the love is all worn out and six months or six years later its over and you move on.Then theres love that matures. Theres a set of things you like about a person, even love. Mix that in with some lust. Then this love mashup changes over time.Or you learn to adapt because you know that a maturing love is not one where you settle or explore the subtleties inside the other person but you are finally able to explore the subtletites inside of yourself.And sometimes you just fall out of love. There is no shame in this. Do what your heart tells you to do.Some relationships are weird combinations of all of the above. They are tumultuous. There is much pain and much pleasure. Perhaps tennis was like that for Agassi. I cant speak for him.But to become a master at anything there will be much pain. And it cant be avoided. Nobody has avoided it.If something is too much pain, then its not the worst thing in the world to give up. I dont like dental surgery. Its too much pain for me. So my teeth are messed up a bit. I give up on having perfect teeth.I) PSYCHOLOGY.One reason most people in the world dont get really good at anything is because they have no talent for anything that anyone cares about.Another reason is they dont want to put in the work. I understand this.Often its better to be social and have friends and strong family relationships and love people.Many people who have mastered something often have a hard time with their relationships with family members or spouses or friends. Van Gogh cut off his ear. Dostoevsky, Kafka, Bobby Fischer, Godel, were never known for their social skills and often were faced with depression, suicidal tendencies or borderline schizophrenia.When you have a career, theres this idea that you will go from success to success. You start in the cubicle, then you get an office, then a corner office, then you move horizontally into a CEO position at another company, and so on.You might have some failures along the way but they wont be big failures.With mastery the one thing in common is that there are ALWAYS big failures.With poker champ Ylon Schwartz, the day before he left for Las Vegas in 2008 where he won over $3 million I was with him, providing support for him in a court case. He had a court appointed attorney because he was dead broke and in debt.He asked me that day, I have to get on a plane for Las Vegas tomorrow and when I get back I could go to jail. How am I going to get through this?I didnt have an answer for him other than the usual cliches. But he got on that plane. And every day he went higher and higher in chips. And he won $3.7 million in that tournament and hasnt looked back.A lot of people in the investing world dont like Tim Sykes. He has a very arrogant marketing style. Hes a friend of mine and I can tell you hes not that arrogant. Hes extremely humble. The reason hes so humble is that hes gone broke several times since his first success.Its no fun going broke. Ive gone broke several times. You never go broke and think, Well, it didnt work this time, but it will work next time.You go broke and you think, That was the worst experience in my life and Id be better off dead. That was my last chance. Its all over for me now. Id rather be dead than go through this pain Im feeling right now. And everyone around me would be better off if I were dead.Thats what you think.And when Tim was making one of his comebacks, nobody would speak to him. I had him on some videos with the company I was working with but ultimately they banned him.So he chose himself. He did all of the above. Ive since looked at his audited track record and seen that hes made millions from trading. I know 1000s of daytraders. 1000s. I know one successful daytrader and thats Tim.On the path to Mastery, everything will go wrong.As Robert Greene points out in his book, Mastery, Napoleon got banished to Elba where he supposedly said his famous palindrome (somehow speaking English for the first and only time in his life) Able was I ere I saw ElbaEvery master has his Elba. Banished to an island where the life you once knew no longer exists and it seems like there is no way to escape.Napoleon escaped because he was the best in the world at what he does.Because he had the psychology, or perhaps the blind spot, to not recognize that this was it, his final destination. Studying how he came back to power is a great example of psychology mixed with all of the above skills in becoming a master.Tim went from millions to broke to trading out of his parents basement to millions again and this time hes not going to fall back.Bobby Fischer spent much of his life in borderline schizophrenic agony when he couldnt deal with his losses. Hed disappear for years at a time but then come back stronger than ever.How do you build that psychology? I dont know. Its a combination of many things:\\nEgo. A real belief that you can be the best, against all possible rational evidence against this. Against everyone trashing you simultaneously.\\nNo way out. I asked Ylon, Lewis, and many others what were they thinking at rock bottom and the answer almost always was: What else could I do with my life? I had to keep going!\\nJ) PERSISTENCE.Add up all of the above and you get persistence. Persistence creates luck.Persistence overcomes failure. Persistence gets you experience. Persistence is a sentence of failures punctuated by the briefest of successes, and eventually those successes will start to propel you towards mastery.Not one success or two. But many many many.How do you get persistent when life is filled with changing careers, relationships, responsibilities, economic crashes, historical upswings, and so many things that can get in your way.Theres no answer at all. Thats why its called persistence. Because no matter where you are, there you are, doing what you always did. Not letting any of the above stop you. Using all of the above in your Mastery Arsenal to propel you to higher successes and deeper failures and then even higher successes.Its painful and brutal and no fun and nobody will ever understand why. And when you achieve success people will act as if its the most natural thing in the world to have happened to you.And you try to explain, No, there was this one time but they dont want to hear it. They want to know what their next move should be so they can be where you are.Theres no next move. Theres only your next move.K) MYSTERYUltimately, Mastery = Mystery. Youre going to break the sound barrier on some field that nobody has ever gone that fast or that far. Youre going to find your own unique combination of passions that make you the best in the world at that combination.What if nobody cares? Thats ok also. You care.What if you never go for the mystery. What if you settle back into the known, the comfortable, the stress-free existence of your peers and colleagues and everyone you ever knew.The world might not allow it. What you thought was comfortable mightve been a myth also.So you can only do this:Ask: what can I do right now to move forward. Only this second. Having a goal in the distant future is almost a damnation of this moment in time. An insult.We cant predict the future. And the history of mastery shows that nobody was able to predict which goals would work and which wouldnt.Only this moment matters. Health-wise: physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Can you move forward today in each?Then you will attract the mastery and the mystery.- - -THE GOOD NEWS:You dont have to be the master of the world. You dont have to do any of the above.Very few people do. And many of them experienced much hardship and pain along the way. And will continue to experience that hardship.We live in a culture where its almost a damnation to be considered mediocre. But society has no clue about what real mastery is. Dont listen to any of the Top 10 things articles. Dont listen to anyone. Not even me.Freud has said that our two goals in life are human connection and achievement.But often its a reasonable goal to overcome these evolutionary inclinations.To be happy with your loved ones. To be satisfied for every gift in your life, for every moment, not rushing to the next moment of mastery. True mastery can be found right here, right now.Choosing yourself right now in how you treat yourself, how you treat the people around you, how you treat your efforts and your loves.Nothing is more important than this. Nothing compounds into greater happiness in life more than this.Because when you rush to get to a mythical THERE, one day you will arrive and realize you missed all of the pleasures and mysteries along the way.]',\n",
       "  134: \"[Ugh, Im disgusted with my brain. I see people walking down the street and theres like this killer inside me providing running nasty commentary about each person. Do you do this also?I have to stop myself often: you dont know this person who is randomly crossing the street. You cant possibly know that hes a cheating lying rich Hamptons-worshipping whoremongering obnoxious trust fund baby with a 17 year old mistress on the side who doesnt wipe, who doesnt wash, who would wish nothing better than to see you die.You cant know that! So why do I think it? Most people crossing the street probably think that about me also. Who is that freak? Is he homeless? Why cant he comb his hair? Why is his fly open? Is he a child molesting pervert?Most people are pretty crappy. But not all. And even the ones who are no good and not worthy of your time need a system for you to use so YOU can be happier and leave this lecherous gossipy crack addict that's in your head on the road and kick him or her to the curb.There are only four types of people. If you understand in advance how to deal with each of these four types you will be infinitely happier. Ultimately, interacting with the four types in the way I describe below will make one fit firmly into the first type, however difficult it is. Thats the goal. You dont want to go through life unhappy.There is no path to happiness. Happiness is the path.In an earlier article on my blog I gave my own Daily Practice that has helped me out of every tough situation in my life for the past 15 years (when Ive been disciplined enough to apply it).It has 4 legs. Many of us focus in our daily lives on only one of the legs (Physical, Emotional, Mental, or Spiritual) but we need all the legs in balance to really sit down at the dinner table without falling.The Practice works and brings one from the brink to success and then more success. I believe in it more than Ive ever believed in any hocus-pocus anything ever.But to develop the emotional leg of that practice takes a lot of work and Ive written nothing on this. Probably because its the hardest. In my talks people ask about the Mental side, the idea muscle. But the Emotional side, equally as important, is much harder.The key is to identify the FOUR types of people and discipline yourself on how you should approach these people.The Four Types of People#1 Happy. There are people who are genuinely happy in the world. Sure they have their suffering. Everyone does. But a lot of people really are pretty satisfied with their lives at this very moment.A natural reflex (not for everyone, but certainly for some people) is to resent people for being happy. Who doesnt do that some of the time? Raise your hand!Lets say someone lives in 20,000 square foot house in Connecticut, has a sexy wife (or sexy husband), and is genuinely happy. Its hard not to resent such a person. This resentment will block the Daily Practice from having beneficial outcomes in your life. In 2002 when I was pitching hedge fund managers to invest money with me I often ran into the exact person described above. And their families. The sexy wives in short shorts. The hedge fund managers served gourmet meals for lunchtime by loving cooks.(Stevie Cohens house. Heres How Stevie Cohen Changed My Life)You cant fake resentment. You cant put on a mask. If someone is at a costume ball, you can easily see they are wearing a mask. You have to genuinely be happy for these people.Its so hard to grab a single ounce of happiness in this world, please be happy for the ones who are happy today. Train your mind to be sincerely happy for their happiness. Catch your resentments and jealousies before they turn into monsters.Carrie Fisher once said, nobody wants to read about a good looking happy person. She was making a commentary on comedy screenwriting and shes probably right about that. But for you to go from success to success you must first be sincerely happy for the people who are happy around you. Like attracts. Picture all the people you might resent. Spend five minutes a day training your brain to be happy for them. Youll die lonely in the jungle if you dont do this and everyone will forget you ever existed.#2 People in pain. Ive been unhappy often. Particularly in the past decade. Sometimes things just dont work out. Sometimes people die. I think the level of unhappiness and pain Ive had in the past decade (versus prior decades) has taught me compassion towards others in a similar boat. Try to cultivate that compassion. It doesnt mean you have to drain yourself to help those less fortunate.But even showing compassion and doing what you can goes a long way. If you can share what you have, all the better. If you can give a word of advice, do it.Unhappy person can easily turn into category #4 below. You always have to protect yourself first. Be compassionate but keep your boundaries. Your goal is your own peace of mind throughout the day, so you can focus on your own success. The fastest way to do that is show compassion to those less fortunate. What you give, comes back tenfold. Try this exercise: picture everyone in your life who is unhappy or in pain, spend five minutes picturing them in a happier state. This trains your mind.#3 Good people. This is different from Happy. Good people dont always have ulterior motives. Some people legitimately want to help others. Theres an initial impulse (at least with me) to suspect them. To resent them. Maybe even to envy them. I envy Bill Gates being able to donate $100 billion to charity. But the best thing for me is to catch myself doing that (almost a meditation in itself) and say, this guy is good. I wish I could be as good as him. I hope I can help him in any way I can. Be grateful for all the people good to you. Five minutes a day. Doesnt have to be with incense burning and in the lotus position. On a bus, smile and think of the people you are grateful for.(Im starting to believe Gates has become a genuinely good guy)And finally, the most important category of all. The category that wastes a quadrillion brain cycles a day around the world. What man can say he is Jesus and not fall prey to the ongoing anger and pain of dealing with this next category:#4 Crappy people: People who will do you harm, no matter what you do, for no reason at all. They never will get it. They will say and do things to you and they will never ever understand how evil they are.And you will hate them. HATE THEM. And they knock on the door of your brain at three in the morning and they want to yell at you. And you yell back. And they yell back. And on and on. All day. All afternoon. The ongoing conversation with the shittiest people in the world. They will torture you, kill you, and slit the thoughts out of your mind and not even care because they think they are doing the right thing.You know who Im talking about. Because you have a good 20 or 30 of these in your life just like I do. They might even be former friends, relatives, neighbors, bureaucrats, whatever, whoever, whenever. They swoop down on your life and are just plain crappy and they wont even know it.They wont ever know who they are so there is no way to convince them. Thats the trap.Sometimes, in a weak moment, I think to myself: What if I run into them again? How badly I will hurt and destroy them. Maybe just casually walk up to them and smash a glass over their head so their nose is broken, glasses broken on the floor, blood all over their face. Arm broken after I hold the elbow and stomp on it.STOP!Similarly, I was talking to someone the other day who couldnt stop talking about someone who had wronged her fourteen years ago. Stop! You are an idiot. And its boring already. It was your fault anyway! This is the worst category. Ill tell you one more anecdote. Two seconds ago someone posted a horrible comment on my blog. I wont repeat it. Racist, mean, rude to me, whatever. I deleted the post, blocked the user, blocked his IP address. And then I was going to send him an email telling him what I thought of him. I was angry. Then I stopped myself. You have to stop yourself.Remember this:When you get in the mud with a pig, you get dirty and the pig gets happy.There is only ONE only way to deal with these people in a way that will make you happier instead of sadder. ONE WAY. And it always works. This is the most important part of the Emotional leg of the Daily Practice. COMPLETELY IGNORE THE EVIL PEOPLE:\\nCompletely ignore them.\\n Dont think about them.\\nDont talk to them.\\nDont write them.\\nMost important: Dont give them advice. They will NEVER listen to your advice. Its arrogant and stupid to think they will. It will only lead to more cycles of pain for you. The goal for me is to stop all cycles that cause me any pain at all. Giving advice to crappy people will only result in more pain for you. Thats the only possible result. Much better to be happy than to flush knotted up brown advice down a toilet that caused you agony to push out. This is hard.\\nMost important: Never gossip about them behind their backs. Just completely disregard. We dont care about their happiness or how evil they are. We only care about you. Its hard to do. Never ever talk about them behind their backs. Repeat this 500 times. This is hard also. Because its an addiction.\\nThis isnt easy. Its a daily discipline. Much easier to do a 1000 pushups. I had an article recently on the Wall St Journal site that had 971 comments. No exaggeration when I say 950 of the smartest anonymous trolls on the internet called me an idiot moron and worse. I ignored all the comments. Great. I could care less. I was the winner there.Then I put another article up on a supposedly peaceful site about Buddhism and yoga, the Elephant Journal. Great site. I post there regularly. The topic of my post was that 18 year olds should basically not be sent into war. I like peace. Better to send 40 year olds. They are closer to death anyway. The most hateful responses popped up. People comparing me to Hitler. I was so shocked I wasted one whole night until 2 in the morning responding to these people but ignoring the many emails I get that genuinely support me and that I want to be friends with. Why did I do that? I wanted my haters to like me. I wanted them to agree with me and love me. Its like putting a gun to your head and saying, unless you do what I say, I will kill myself. Youre going to end up firing that gun.I lost my discipline for a whole night and then I slept late and it took at least 36 hours to get back on track. What a waste. For nothing! Its hard to keep up this practice. But you fail and die unhappy if you dont. And did I win a trophy for doing this? Was it a huge trophy made of gold? For responding to all of those comments? Did everyone/anyone write back and say, youre right. Im sorry. Now I LOVE you! Lets all be lovers! Of course not! They just want to fight. I got in the mud with pigs. I got dirty. If someone says, what do you think of so-and-so, your worst enemy, you say back, So-and-so who? And thats it. No explanation. Nothing more. So and so who? Change subject right then. This is the emotional leg of the Daily Practice and must be balanced with the other three legs. Any deviation will set you back. Any addiction to the opposite of the above behaviors will eat you alive like cockroaches feasting on your heart. Have a good night.Photo Credits:Crying lady by Toni BlayBill Gates by World Economic ForumWater reflection by Danilo]\",\n",
       "  135: '[The most popular search term that takes people to my blog is I Want to Die.It doesnt matter what the economic data says, what the stock market does, or how long youve been at your company. Every day people are getting fired and its fast and swift and unexpected like a stray bullet that hits a 4 year old by accident in a drive-by.Now its an economic drive-by. I see the fallout and the tears every day as weve moved from 10% underemployment to over 30% underemployment.(youre fired!)One time I was so broke, and it felt so bad for me, that I wanted to kill myself. I thought my kids would do better with my life insurance policy than with me.But, as I told my 11 year old many years later, theres no painless way to kill yourself. Ive done the research. Theres nothing.Ive been fired so many times I cant list them all. Ive had to reinvent my career when entire industries exploded. Reinvention is a hard and brutal process but it is possible and I describe how I specifically do it in my post, the ultimate guide to reinventing myself. But sometimes the stress is too much and its too early to think about following that dream of being a ballerina or an acrobat or a world-famous writer/entrepreneur.I would pace at three in the morning. Im going to lose this house. My kids are going to switch schools. I have three months to live. Im going to lose this house. Im going to this and that and this/that. The chatter doesnt stop and its nightmarish at three in the morning. And at four, and at five, and it doesnt stop when the kids wake up and they dont know anything is different but I cry then because everything is different. Because the house is a prison. Because my head is a mental asylum.No advice helps. You cant meditate. You cant exercise. You cant eat healthy. You cant shave. Or bathe. You cant even take deep breaths. They feel like bullshit breaths. Shit breathes in and shit breathes out. You cant pray or read spiritual texts. None of that stuff helps, you think. None of that immediately deposits money in the bank. None of that brings back your self-esteem which was so randomly stolen from you by faceless bureaucats living on the outskirts of cubicles.So heres advice that helps. I hope you follow it because I know it worked for me:Do just one thing today.And then do one thing tomorrow. And the next. Thats all. Just one thing a day. If you do your thing, then feel good. You did it. Tomorrow you do the next thing. THATS ALL YOU NEED TO DO.Some preliminaries: First, you need to sleep. Make sure you sleep 8 hours a day, every day. And you cant drink. Delete your news-intake. You dont need news now. Things are bad. But they arent as bad as they seem. The media lies every day about how bad things are. Trust me.And then do one solid thing each day.Here are some possible one things:- Schedule a lunch with someone you havent seen in three years. Could be anyone. But it has to be someone you havent seen in at least three years. This injects new blood into the system. You need a total transfusion to get rid of the infected old blood.- Ideas. Find your customers. Treat yourself like a one-man business. Make a list of customers (i.e. places or people you might want to work with) Then come up with a list of 10 ideas for each customer/place you might want to work. Ideas that can make them money. This way you keep your idea muscle intact. Dont let your idea muscle atrophy! Pitch your ideas to that customer if you can. If you cant , move onto the next customer. But wait until tomorrow. You did your thing for today. Be proud. THIS TECHNIQUE WORKS. Its worked for me.- Gratitude. Make a list of the people youve worked with over the past ten years that you are grateful you worked with. Email them and tell them why you were grateful you worked with them. Ask them sincerely how they are doing. This is one of the most important things on this list.- Wake up early, exercise, take a shower, wear a suit, go into the city, and walk around. Smell that freshness on you. It makes you feel as if you are ready for anything. And you are. Thats all you need to do that day. Heck, go to a museum. You wont have this opportunity for freedom forever.- Slash. Make a list of all expenses you can slash. Make your runway as long as possible. There are plenty of sites to advise how to do this. Picture your worst-worst case scenario. Its never as bad as you think. Write it down. Write down the plan for the worst-case scenario. Then take a nap. You just had a hard day. You need to rest.- Lunch, part II. Have lunch with one person in your industry. Have your ideas ready for that person. Have him critique your ideas. Learn.(lunch can be fun)- Reconnect. Contact other people who used to work at your old company. Maybe they even worked there ten years ago. Reconnect. Come up with ideas for them.You know what a fun thing for me is. Sometimes I go back to my emails from 2007 or 2008. I find an email I never responded to for whatever reason. And then I respond as if they had just sent the email. Its amazing the results I have gotten from that simple exercise.- Write. Write a book in the next three days. You can write a 30 page book about dieting (100 ways to Lose 100 pounds) and put it on sale on Amazon in one day. Why not? The traditional book industry is over. Write the book 100 things to do the day after you are fired. Make it funny. Time to dominate the publishing industry while you are unemployed. Today make a list of all the possible 30 page books you can do. Then tomorrow start one of the books. You think this is not possible? I have one friend who just self-published a book. He was dead broke before that after being fired from his job. He made $200,000 in 90 days. No joke. This was about a month ago.- Resentment. You are going to feel resentful about people at your old job. They wronged you. But listen closely: they are just trying to survive also. They arent different from you and me, no matter how much you feel they wronged you. You need to make a list of all the good qualities that person has and send them an email why you think they are good at what they do. Thank them.- Brainstorm. Go completely in a different direction. What other industry can you work in? What other location can you live in? Make up the wildest fantasies about what you can do. Keep going until there is one possible direction you can execute on today. Brainstorm what blog you can do (and what products you can sell on the blog). Brainstorm about photography (anyone need a photographer this weekend?) Brainstorm about ecommerce (check out penny auction sites where you can buy stuff for pennies and resell on Ebay). I dont know. Im making stuff up. But brainstorm for an hour and some little slice of reality might peak through.Remember: just one thing a day at first. Some of these things above seem crazy. But Im not recommending anything that I havent done and made money doing. All of them.If you are feeling better, go for the full Daily Practice I describe in many posts. But dont stress it. The Daily Practice has always worked for me when Ive hit my low points on repeated occasions. But first do one thing a day. No pressures.Anyone who is fired today, feel free to email me and tell me what is going on. Or sign up for my email list where I give out a free copy of my new unreleased book (The Choose Yourself Stories), which I dont intend to release for another month.But no matter what, do that one thing. Get the blood moving. Get the heart moving. Then the rest will follow and you will be ok.]',\n",
       "  136: \"[This was going to end badly.My boss screamed at me in front of my colleagues. I had done something wrong of course. I had sent a product to the client without debugging it thoroughly. It was my fault. But I dont like being yelled at.And fortunately I was sitting on a job offer that I decided to take that moment. So the next day I said the magic words, I quit.And then a few years after that, I quit again, and never went back to work in the corporate world.And now its too late. Now the course of history has finally written its next chapter. Theres no more bullshit. Im going to tell you why you have to quit your job. Why you need to get the ideas moving. Why you need to build a foundation for your life or soon you will have no roof.(Jabbas newest employee)1) The middle class is dead. A few weeks ago I visited a friend of mine who manages a trillion dollars. No joke. A trillion. If I told you the name of the family he worked for you would say, they have a trillion? Really? But thats what happens when ten million dollars compounds at 2% over 200 years.He said, look out the windows. We looked out at all the office buildings around us. What do you see? he said. I dont know. Theyre empty! All the cubicles are empty. The middle class is being hollowed out. And I took a closer look. Entire floors were dark. Or there were floors with one or two cubicles but the rest empty. Its all outsourced or technology has taken over for the paper shufflers, he said.Not all the news is bad, he said. More people entered the upper class than ever last year. But, he said, more people are temp staffers than ever.And thats the new paradigm. The middle class has died. The American Dream never really existed. It was a marketing scam.And it was. The biggest provider of mortgages for the past 50 years, Fannie Mae, had as their slogan, We make the American Dream come true. It was just a marketing slogan all along. How many times have I cried because of a marketing slogan. And then they ruined it.2) Youve been replaced.Technology, outsourcing, a growing temp staffing industry, productivity efficiencies, have all replaced the middle class.The working class. Most jobs that existed 20 years ago arent needed now. Maybe they never were needed. The entire first decade of this century was spent with CEOs in their Park Avenue clubs crying through their cigars, how are we going to fire all this dead weight?. 2008 finally gave them the chance. It was the economy! they said. The country has been out of a recession since 2009. Four years now. But the jobs have not come back. I asked many of these CEOs: did you just use that as an excuse to fire people, and they would wink and say, lets just leave it at that.Im on the board of directors of a temp staffing company with one billion dollars in revenues. I can see it happening across every sector of the economy. Everyone is getting fired. Everyone is toilet paper now.Flush.(robots are the new middle class)3) Corporations dont like you. The executive editor of a major news publication took me out to lunch to get advice on how to expand their website traffic. But before I could talk he started complaining to me: our top writers keep putting their twitter names in their posts and then when they get more followers they start asking for raises.Whats the problem? I said. Dont you want writers that are popular and well-respected?When I say a major news publication I am talking MAJOR.He said, no, we want to be about the news. We dont want anyone to be an individual star.In other words, his main job was to destroy the career aspirations of his most talented people, the people who swore their loyalty to him, the people who worked 90 hours a week for him. If they only worked 30 hours a week and were slightly more mediocre he wouldve been happy. But he doesnt like you. He wants to you stay in the hole and he will throw you a meal every once in awhile in exchange for your excrement. If anyone is a reporter out there and wants to message me privately I will tell you who it was. But basically, its all of your bosses. Every single one of them.4) Money is not happiness. A common question during my Twitter Q&amp;A (that I give every Thursday from 330-430 PM EST), asked at least once a week, is should I take the job I like or should I take the job that pays more money.Leaving aside the question of should I take a job at all, lets talk about money for a second.First, the science: studies show that an increase in salary only offers marginal to zero increase in happiness above a certain level. Why is this? Because the basic fact: people spend what they make. If your salary increases $5,000 you spend an extra $2000 on features for your car, you have an affair, you buy a new computer, a better couch, a bigger TV, and then you ask, where did all the money go? Even though you needed none of the above now you need one more thing: another increase in your salary, so back to the corporate casino for one more try at the salary roulette wheel. I have never once seen anyone save the increase in their salary.In other words, dont stay at the job for safe salary increases over time. That will never get you where you want  freedom from financial worry. Only free time, imagination, creativity, and an ability to disappear will help you deliver value that nobody ever delivered before in the history of mankind.5) Count right now how many people can make a major decision that can ruin your life.I dont like it when one person can make or break me. A boss. A publisher. A TV producer. A buyer of my company. At any one point Ive had to kiss ass to all of the above. I hate it. I will never do it again.The way to avoid this is to diversify the things you are working on so no one person or customer or boss or client can make a decision that could make you rich or destroy you or fulfill your lifes dreams or crush them. I understand it cant happen in a day. Start planning now how to create your own destiny instead of allowing people who dont like you to control your destiny. When you do this count, make sure the number comes to over 20. Then when you spin the wheel the odds are on your side that a winning number comes up.6) Is your job satisfying your needs? I will define needs the way I always do, via the four legs of what I call the daily practice. Are your physical needs, your emotional needs, your mental needs, and your spiritual needs being satisfied?The only time Ive had a job that did was when I had to do little work so that I had time on the side to either write, or start a business, or have fun, or spend time with friends. The times when I havent is when I was working too hard, dealing with people I didnt like, getting my creativity crushed over and over, and so on. When you are in those situations you need to plot out your exit strategy.Your hands are not made to type out memos. Or put paper through fax machines. Or hold a phone up while you talk to people you dislike. 100 years from now your hands will rot like dust in your grave. You have to make wonderful use of those hands now. Kiss your hands so they can make magic.One can argue, not everyone is entitled to have all of those needs satisfied at a job. Thats true. But since we already know that the salary of a job wont make you happy, you can easily modify lifestyle and work to at least satisfy more of your needs. And the more these needs are satisfied the more you will create the conditions for true abundance to come into your life.Your life is a house. Abundance is the roof. But the foundation and the plumbing need to be in there first or the roof will fall down, the house will be unlivable. You create the foundation by following the Daily Practice. I say this not because I am selling anything but because it worked for me every time my roof caved in. My house has been bombed, my home has been cold and blistering winds gave me frost bite, but I managed to rebuild. This is how I did it.        (another day on the job)7) Your Retirement Plan is For S**t. I dont care how much you set aside for your 401k. Its over. The whole myth of savings is gone. Inflation will carve out the bulk of your 401k. And in order to cash in on that retirement plan you have to live for a really long time doing stuff you dont like to do. And then suddenly youre 80 and youre living a reduced lifestyle in a cave and can barely keep warm at night.The only retirement plan is to Choose Yourself. To start a business or a platform or a lifestyle where you can put big chunks of money away. Some people can say, well, Im just not an entrepreneur .This is not true. Everyone is an entrepreneur. The only skills you need to be an entrepreneur: an ability to fail, an ability to have ideas, to sell those ideas, to execute on those ideas, and to be persistent so even as you fail you learn and move onto the next adventure. Or be an entrepreneur at work. An entre-ployee. Take control of who you report to, what you do, what you create. Or start a business on the side. Deliver some value, any value, to any body, to somebody, and watch that value compound into a carer.What is your other choice? To stay at a job where the boss is trying to keep you down, will eventually replace you, will pay you only enough for you to survive, will rotate between compliments and insults so you stay like a fish caught on the bait as he reels you in. Is that your best other choice? You and I have the same 24 hours each day. Is that how you will spend yours?8) Excuses. Im too old. Im not creative. I need the insurance. I have to raise my kids. I was at a party once. A stunningly beautiful woman came up to me and said, James, how are you!?WHAT? Who are you?I said, hey! Im doing well. But I had no idea who I was talking to. Why would this woman be talking to me? I was too ugly. It took me a few minutes of fake conversation to figure out who she was.It turns out she was the frumpish-looking woman who had been fired six months earlier from the job we were at. She had cried as she packed up her cubicle when she was fired. She was out of shape, she looked about 30 years older than she was, and now her life was going to go from better to worse. Untilshe realized that she was out of the zoo. In the George Lucas movie, THX-1138 (the name of the main character was THX-1138) everyones choices are removed and they all live underground because above ground is radioactive. Finally THX decides better to die above ground than suffer forever underground where he wasnt allowed to love. He wasnt free.He makes his way above ground, evading all the guards and police. And when he gets there, its sunny, everyone above ground is beautiful, and they are waiting for him with open arms and kisses. The excuse but its radioactive out there! was just there to keep him down.This is easy for you to say, people say to me. Some of us HAVE to do this! The now-beautiful woman had to do it also. What are you doing now? I asked her. Oh, you know, she said. Consulting. But some people say, I cant just go out there and consult. What does that even mean?And to that I answer, Ok, I agree with you. Who am I to argue? If someone insists they need to be in prison even though the door is unlocked then I am not going to argue. They are free to stay in prison.[Or, you can see my Ultimate Cheat Sheet for Dealing with Excuses.]9) It's ok to take baby steps. I cant just QUIT! people say. I have bills to pay. I get it. Nobody is saying quit today. Before a human being runs a marathon they learn to crawl, then take baby steps, then walk, then run. Then exercise every day and stay healthy. Then run a marathon. Heck, what am I even talking about? I cant run more than two miles without collapsing in agony. I am a wimp.Make the list right now. Every dream. I want to be a bestselling author. I want to reduce my material needs. I want to have freedom from many of the worries that I have succumbed to all my life. I want to be healthy. I want to help all of the people around me or the people who come into my life. I want everything I do to be a source of help to people. I want to only be around people I love, people who love me. I want to have time for myself.THESE ARE NOT GOALS. These are themes. Every day, what do I need to do to practice those themes? It starts the moment I wake up: who can I help today? I ask the darkness when I open my eyes. Who would you have me help today? Im a secret agent and Im waiting for my mission. Ready to receive. This is how you take baby steps. This is how eventually you run towards freedom.10) Abundance will never come from your job. Only stepping out of the prison imposed on you from your factory will allow you to achieve abundance. You cant see it now. Its hard to see the gardens when you are locked in jail. Abundance only comes when you are moving along your themes. When you are truly enhancing the lives of the people around you.When every day you wake up with that motive of enhancement. Enhance your family, your friends, your colleagues, your clients, potential customers, readers, people who you dont even know yet but you would like to know. Become a beacon of enhancement and then when the night is gray, all of the boats will move towards you, bringing their bountiful riches.- - -Dont believe me. Stay with a boss that hates you. A job that is keeping you locked on a chain around your neck, tantalizing you with incremental increases in pay and job title. Stay in a culture that is quietly replacing the entire middle class. This is not anyones fault. This is the tectonic plates of economics destroying an entire suburban culture that has lasted for almost 100 years.Until you choose yourself for success, and all that choice entails, you will be locked into the prison. You will stare into your lovers eyes looking for a sign that he or she loves you back. But slowly the lights will fade, the warmth of another body will grow cold, and you will go to sleep dreamless in the dark once again.]\",\n",
       "  137: '[          When I first wrote a novel in 1991 I remember walking down the road and seeing a pretty girl and thinking, She might like me now.I know that a lot of what I write seems to involve whether or not women like me.But thats what I think about. I want people to like me. And when I was younger, it was more important that women like me than that men like me.I also wanted money. I didnt want to work for a boss. That scary feeling of being called into the bosss office after you know you did something that was wrong.I put it in quotes because what does it matter now? What did it even matter then?How could you, my sweet baby, ever do something wrong?Note: the above sentence is what I would whisper to myself after being summoned to the bosss office.Dont you have any pride in your work? Clean out your desk today. Did you steal all of the paper? Why did the office cleaning lady find 20 moldy sandwiches in your drawer? Why didnt you test the software before it went to the client.Whatever. Its because I was busy and no I didnt have pride in my work.I was 22 years old and looking at women and trying to publish a novel on the side so I didnt have to work anymore. And I have no comment about the sandwiches.It took many years before I made any money as a writer. And what works then is different now. Right now its easier than ever.But the rules changed every 3 or 4 years and they will change again. Just like they change with everything in life.By the way, that first novel, and the four that came after it, and the 50 short stories that came after it, never got published.I used to think I needed to publish something before I could feel good about myself, before I could call myself a writer, before I could have a girlfriend, before I could get a real job, before I could move to NYC.What a pathetic weight on my shoulder to think I needed something controlled by just a handful of people. Those weights stayed on my back for years.When you have weights on you, you cant move. The weights are only mental. Go ahead. Move.So GO!A) YOU ARE A WRITER.If you sit down at a blank screen every day and simply do nothing then you are a writer. If you write one word, even better.Some people will disagree. Maybe you will disagree. Thats fine.We also can all disagree. Meanwhile, our DNA is telling us we are pretty much exactly the same. People argue and DNA laughs.B) READ A TON OF STUFF.I try to read pieces or chapters in 3-4 books a day or more. I read at least from one non-fiction, one or two quality fiction, and one inspirational.I try to read at the level I want to write. I do this in the morning before I start writing. If you email me, you can see in the auto response some of the latest things Ive been reading.At night I relax and read things that are a little more like junk food  fun things that I want to read but dont necessarily inspire my writing. If you dont like reading, you wont like writing.Before I wrote this morning, I read parts of books from Teju Cole, Bukowski, Eckhart Tolle, and the blog Hyperbole and a Half.Someone wrote in a comment to someone elses post a few weeks ago: What if James Altucher had to take care of two kids in the morning?Yes, its true. Kids suck. But sometimes I do have to do that. Plus I have other responsibilities. So I wake up at 4am and begin reading and writing. Or earlier. Whatever it takes.C) GET RID OF PREJUDICE.Agents, publishers, editors, at the traditional companies are mostly bullshit.They have no clue what they are doing. For the most part they pick sucky writers whose books flash for a week or so and then disappear forever.And they take a year to publish your book after they accept your book. This is not 100% true. But try to gauge the entrepreneurship of the people you are dealing with. You need people as creative as you. It needs to be a team and not a machine.You can traditionally publish, but make sure you are doing it with creative entrepreneurs and not people stuck in the machine.If you think you need a mainstream publisher for reasons of ego or prejudice then you are guaranteed to publish a worst-seller instead of a bestseller.The second you start to think something, anything, is IMPORTANT, then your ego will suffer and your work will suffer.If you are an artist, get your art in the hands of people. Thats your only job. Destroy every gatekeeper.D) SELF-PUBLISHING IS NOT E-BOOKS.If you self-publish, you can make an e-book, you can also make a print-on-demand book through Createspace, you can make an Audio book through Audible, you can make a hardcover, you can even make a t-shirt with your book on it.I have over 20 t-shirts with the entire 67,000 words of Choose Yourself! printed on it. My kids have several shirts. Claudia does. Nobody is allowed to walk into this house without wearing that t-shirt.Do what you want. Self-publishing simply means you write a book and you figure out how to get it into the hands of other people. It might just be you sell it on your email list. Congrats! Youre then a published author.In my post, How to Self Publish a Bestseller I write about the details and the numbers.E) BOOKSTORES ARE EVIL.My kids are sad that Borders is dying and that Barnes &amp; Noble is next. Keep your mouths shut, kids!I get it. I love bookstores also. Its like a work of art to see all of those covers, to thumb through the pages, to grab a pile of books and a coffee and start seeing what books you want to buy.But dont forget just 20 years ago everyone said Barnes &amp; Noble was evil because they were killing the independent bookstore.I have news for you: the indies were evil also. One guy picking out 500 of his favorite books and no others.Now a B&amp;N might have 10,000 books but Amazon has 20 million books. Why would you ever give someone the choice to limit you. I hope all bookstores die and that Amazon is the only one left standing. Because then every author has a chance and not just the ones the B&amp;N gatekeeper decides on.And Ill tell you how I am doing my role: I pick out the books I might buy in a Barnes &amp; Noble. I take them to the coffee shop in the store. I buy my coffee and start thumbing through the books.Then I buy the books right there and then in the store.On my Kindle.Screw you, Barnes &amp; Noble.F) PLATFORM IS SHIT.I agree its important to have some Internet presence. You need to sell your first 1000 books once you publish and the Internet is a good way to do it.But your free audience is not the way to do it. They read your blog for free. They dont even want to fork over 99 cents to buy your book.I will give you an example: on my last book, Choose Yourself! I obviously encouraged my readers to buy it. But another group, Stansberry Research, recommended it to their paying subscribers.In two weeks through them I sold tens of thousands of books. It took my free audience, which was millions bigger, three months to catch up in sales to an audience that had never even heard of me before.Now my book has sold over 100,000 copies and Im getting ready to send out another email bundle to another list. This will be infinitely more valuable than any blog, podcast, marketing, whatever I use to promote my book on the Internet.I love the audience for my blog and these posts. I feel its one of the few times Ive seen a community of genuine good people trying to improve. I dont write here to sell books but to build community and make friends.Most of the Internet is outrage porn and Im glad weve avoided that.That said, I am not an expert on marketing. Ryan Holiday, who is an expert on book marketing (and also told me the term outrage porn), helped me with my book and was an invaluable resource and to this day still is. Ryan and Tucker Max and Nils Parker are building a company which will revolutionize this industry.One rule I have is I am loyal for life to anyone who helps me make money and Ryan definitely helped me.G) BLOG.This seems opposite of what I said above. But blogging is not such a bad idea. How come? Because it makes you write every day. And it also is fun to build friends and community around your blog.But if you want to blog, dont just register a domain name and start blogging. You wont get any traffic.I encourage people to find online communities that they like and feel like participating in and start blogging there or guest posting there.If you are unsure of where and how to blog, start by practicing on a site like Quora, which is a question and answer site that also hosts blogs.Practice answering questions there. See what gets upvoted and what doesnt. Improve your skills. See if you enjoy it. Then start taking some of your answers and making them into a blog. Then start guest posting on other sites.Youre not trying to build an audience for your blog. Youre trying to build an audience for YOU, PERIOD. Theres no money in ads, blah.You have to be more creative than ever how you build an audience. The best Internet marketing I did was when I did a reddit AMA (which Ryan, above, set up).Look at someone like EL James, who wrote Fifty Shades of Grey. I dont even think she had a blog. She was posting on fan fiction sites for Twilight.And millionaire teenage bestseller, Amanda Hocking, was posting in the comments section of JA Konraths site and building community that way.Theres a thousand ways to build community and practice writing on the Internet. Blog is one of them but there are many others. My #1 suggestion: first practice on Quora (cc Marc Bodnick) If you go there, follow me and say Hi!.H) WRITE EVERY DAY.I had a friend who wanted to be a painter. When I move to Paris Ill finally be able to paint, she said. She never moved to Paris. Now shes a programmer and hates her job.I have another friend who has been working for 30 years on one novel. She keeps hating it and rewriting it. She cant get a publisher interested. She only writes when shes inspired. She needs writing groups to push her along.I get it. I get writers block also. But writing is a muscle. I used to play in chess tournaments a lot. I was ranked a master. And then I got busy with other things. So my skill level has dropped. It would take me a good SIX MONTHS OF STUDYING three hours a day to just get back up to my old skill level.If you dont write every day, you wont know what your potential skill level is. You will be producing sub-par work. And in a world where 15 million books will be published this year, your book will have little chance to shine.It doesnt matter if you write good stuff or bad stuff every day. Yesterday, for fun, I wrote about how much I enjoyed bowel movements. Will I publish that? I hope not! It was awful! But I wrote because thats what I wrote yesterday. 1500 words about bowel movements. Mission accomplished.Do the math, if you just write 1000 words a day that are publishable then you have a book every two months. 1000 words a day is not easy. But its not hard either. This post is 1800 words so far and I started 20 minutes ago. Ill spend many more hours rewriting it than writing it but once you start exercising the writing muscle (start with 200 words a day, then 300, etc) you will get up to 1000.Theres a blog about a woman who writes 10,000 words a day and she describes her method. She does detailed outlining first. That method works.When Claudia Azula Altucher and I went away on a silent retreat to write The Power of No, which hasnt come out yet, we were writing about 7,000 words a day.Sometimes more words is not better. If I write a 1000 words, then by the time Ive published Ive usually rewritten and edited it down to 600 words.I) REWRITE EVERY DAY. See above. I feel better about the words I take out then the words I write.First you have a block of stone, then you make a sculpture, then you chisel and fine tune until you have a work of art. Art is born from the rewrite, not from the typewrite.With Choose Yourself! I kept rewriting obsessively.One time the book was all finished and sent to editors, designers, etc. Then I did the audio version. KABLAMO!Any paragraph that made me feel like, Ugh, Im too bored to read this out loud, I noted. Then I went back home and rewrote the whole book again. And the audio version veered so much from the book it was completely unabridged. Everyone hated me. But I liked the final result much beter. Read your work out loud and cut out anything that makes you lag.J) CAN I MAKE MONEY WRITING ARTICLES?No. You used to be able to make a living writing articles. Just a few years ago. In 2005 I made a good living writing about 3-4 articles a day for different publications while I was running my fund and before I started and sold Stockpickr.But those days are over. People just dont pay for content. And there are too many writers. Its a supply and demand thing. If you expect to make a living from articles or blogs then figure out how to do one of three things:\\nBlog for free, but then lead people to a subscription information product. Like stock picks or dating or whatever you think youre an expert at and nobody else is. (cc Ramit Sethi Lewis Howes Tim Sykes Derek Halpern Porter Stansberry etc)\\nGet speaking gigs. This is hard.\\nDo consulting or coaching. This is possible.\\nIve never been that great at any of the three above. Well, maybe #3 but only recently.So this leaves us with only one thing. ONE THING works.K) WRITE A LOT OF BOOKS.If you can write one book and its a mega-bestseller like 50 Shades of Grey then congratulations. There is exactly one of you and I know your name: EL James.For everyone else, you have to write more than one book. And for most people, you have to write dozens of books.I was at a dinner recently of a bunch of self-published Amazon authors who were making a living at it. Every single one of them had more than ten books written and published in the prior year or so.Theresa Ragan, as an example, has 13 or 14 books written (thriller and romance) in the past 2 or 3 years.Hugh Howey, known for his Wool series, has written around 28 books in the past few years. I lost count while counting them. He never stops. I highly recommend his SAND series which just came out.At the dinner there was one woman who had written over 100 books. If she averages $100 a book a month for the rest of her life its not so bad. Choose Yourself! was my 11th or 12th published book. I have four more books sitting here ready to go.Throughout history the best books have often been written in a short amount of time. Bukowskis Post Office and Jack Kerouacs On the Road were both written in three weeks. I can find 1000 more examples.Sean Platt has a good book that just came out about writing many books. I recommend it. Write. Publish. Repeat. I think Sean has published over 50 books. I dont know because he uses pseudonyms as well.Always remember the key rule: an overnight success takes at least five years of solid work (as defined in my prior post The Ultimate Cheat Sheet on Reinventing Yourself).I left out important things: how do you market books, how do you make art, how do you build discipline, what do you write about, and so on. Theres answers for all of those.The most important thing for me: Writing without fear. Writing without judgment. Writing without anger. Making writing fun. Writing right now.Writing is about freedom and not money.I want to write to you something fun and useful. And I want you to read it.]',\n",
       "  138: '[I limped out of the meeting and said, excuse me, and took the elevator down 67 stories, went to Grand Central, limped home, and never went back to work at that job.I never returned the constant phone calls and emails over the next month. James, where did you go?For all I know my name is still on my office door and my name is still on their website. Ive never checked.I just didnt feel like going back or talking to them ever again.A few days earlier I had discussed with the managing partner how I would get paid if I brought in a huge deal. He smiled and said, Trust me, James, I always take care of everyone.When someone says trust me or I will make you rich then I know general fu****** will result. The other thing that happened,spooked me. I was walking with a few of my colleagues to lunch at some crap sandwich place on Wall Street. Suddenly I was on the ground. I had fallen straight down for no reason. I limped for the next three weeks.So my body told me to quit also. I try to listen to my body. Else I cant sleep or crap or move properly. In this case, my body didnt even want me to walk.Whenever things are good I always worry about what could go wrong.And whenever things are bad it always seems like they will never get better. Its not depression. Its how the human brain works after one million years of avoiding predators. Every day I try to practice reversing that. I do that by listening to the body, the mind, being grateful, being around positive people, sleeping a lot, eating well.But having a job and being controlled by Masters ruins the practice.Some new study just came out and said more than 50% of people hate their jobs, for the first time ever.What? For the first time ever? I doubt that.Someone asked me: why do people hate their jobs? I answered: Note, not everyone hates their jobs. There are some entre-ployees out there that love their jobs. But for the other 98% of the population:\\nJobs are modern-day slavery. We are paid just enough to live and not more. You are punished if you ask for more.\\nWe are often verbally abused on the job and we take it because we think its normal that people would yell at us.\\nThe government gets up to 50% of your paycheck and then 10-20% of that goes to kill people on other parts of the planet, including our own children.\\nWe are deluded into thinking our job-friends are our real-friends. With our job friends we talk about pens, genitals, and cubicles. We stop having real-friends.\\nTheres a glass ceiling. It doesnt matter if you are a woman or minority or a white man. The glass ceiling is that you arent allowed to make more than your Master, even if hes an idiot.\\nFrom 7am to 7pm you are either A) going to work, B) at work, or C) coming back from work. Hence, the times when you can be most creative are garbage-compacted into your cubicle.\\nYou eat shit at work. And, even worse, you have to shit next to your co-workers and Masters. Unless, like I have, you make a map of all the secret bathrooms in your local urban blight.\\nWhen you are paranoid at a job, you are probably correct. THEY are, in fact, talking about you and backstabbing you right now.\\nYou realize that all the dollars you spent on degrees to get you a job that will make you happy were completely wasted. You were scammed but you cant let the next generation know how stupid you were so now you become part of perpetuating the scam.\\nA trillion dollar marketing campaign forced you to buy a house you didnt really want and now you will lose a house you never really owned if you dont bow down to the Masters every day. The words The American Dream were coined by Fannie Mae in a marketing campaign 40 years ago to sell mortgages to slaves.\\nYour spouse is tired of hearing about your job after six months. And you couldnt care less about hers. Ten years later you wake up next to a total stranger. 40 years later you die next to one.\\nYour IRA was not intended to provide for your retirement. It was intended to take money from you every month so you remain chained to your cubicle. Inflation then takes 90% of your IRA.\\nWhen you were a kid you liked to draw, and read, and run, and laugh, and play, and imagine a magical world. Youre never going to do any of that again.\\nOver time everyone is getting fired and being replaced by younger, cheaper, more temporary, more robotic, versions of you. You see this but are afraid to do anything about it.\\nYou see homeless people and think, there but for the grace of God go I.\\nThis is not meant to be depressing. Nor does it mean everyone hates their jobs. There are many ways to be an entre-ployee where you dont have the standard job. To be clear: There are more opportunities than ever. But you have to prepare the body and mind and spirit to find those opportunities.Then you take the magic pill and the tears of dirt wipe away. Come here, pretty baby, and let me hug you.]',\n",
       "  139: '[         Back in college, Sanket and I would hang out in bars and try to talk to women but I was horrible at it. Nobody would talk to me for more than thirty seconds and every woman would laugh at all his jokes for what seemed like hours. Even decades later I think they are still laughing at his jokes. One time he turned to me, the girls are getting bored when you talk. Your stories go on too long. From now on, you need to leave out every other sentence when you tell a story. We were both undergrads in Computer Science. I havent seen him since but thats the most important writing (and communicating) advice I ever got.33 other tips to be a better writer.\\nWrite whatever you want. Then take out the first paragraph and last paragraph. Heres the funny thing about this rule. Its sort of like knowing the future. You still cant change it. In other words, even if you know this rule and write the article, the article will still be better if you take out the first paragraph and the last paragraph.\\nTake a huge bowel movement every day. And you wont see that on any other list on how to be a better writer. If your body doesnt flow then your brain wont flow. Eat more fruit if you have to.\\nBleed in the first line. Were all human. A computer can win Jeopardy but still not write a novel. You want people to relate to you, then you have to be human. Penelope Trunk started a post a few weeks ago: I smashed a lamp over my head. There was blood everywhere. And glass. And I took a picture. Thats real bleeding. My wife recently put up a post where the first line was so painful she had to take it down. Too many people were crying.\\nDont ask for permission. In other words, never say in my opinion (or worse IMHO). We know its your opinion. Youre writing it.\\nWrite a lot. I spent the entire 90s writing bad fiction. 5 bad novels. Dozens of bad stories. But I learned to handle massive rejection. And how to put two words together. In my head, I won the pulitzer prize. But in my hand, over 100 rejection letters.\\nRead a lot. You cant write without first reading. A lot. When I was writing five bad novels in a row I would read all day long whenever I wasnt writing (I had a job as a programmer, which I would do for about five minutes a day because my programs all worked and I just had to maintain them). I read everything I could get my hands on.\\nRead before you write. Before I write every day I spend 30-60 minutes reading high quality short stories poetry, or essays. Books by Denis Johnson, Miranda July, David Foster Wallace, Ariel Leve, William Vollmann, Raymond Carver, etc. All of the writers are in the top 1/1000 of 1% of writers. It has to be at that level or else it wont lift up your writing at all.\\nCoffee. I go through three cups at least before I even begin to write. No coffee, no creativity.\\nBreak the laws of physics. Theres no time in text. Nothing has to go in order. Dont make it nonsense. But dont be beholden to the laws of physics. Advice I Want to Tell My Daughters is an example.\\nBe Honest. Tell people the stuff they all think but nobody ever says. Some people will be angry you let out the secret. But most people will be grateful. Else you arent delivering value. Be the little boy in the Emperor Wears No Clothes. If you cant do this, dont write.\\nDont Hurt Anyone. This goes against the above rule. But I never like to hurt people. And I dont respect people who get pageviews by breaking this rule. Dont be a bad guy. Was Buddha a Bad Father? addresses this.\\nDont be afraid of what people think. For each single person you worry about, deduct 1% in quality from your writing. Everyone has deductions. I have to deduct about 10% right off the top. Maybe theres 10 people Im worried about. Some of them are evil people. Some of them are people I just dont want to offend. So my writing is only about 90% of what it could be. But I think most people write at about 20% of what it could be. Believe it or not, clients, customers, friends, family, will love you more if you are honest with them. So we all have our boundaries. But try this: for the next ten things you write, tell people something that nobody knows about you. \\nBe opinionated. Most people I know have strong opinions about at least one or two things. Write about those. Nobody cares about all the things you dont have strong opinions on. Barry Ritholz told me the other day he doesnt start writing until hes angry about something. Thats one approach. Barry and I have had some great writing fights because sometimes weve been angry at each other.\\nHave a shocking title. I blew it the other day. I wanted to title this piece: How I torture women but I settled for Im guilty of torture. I wimped out. But I have some other fun ones. Like is it bad I wanted my first kid to be aborted (which the famous Howard Lindzon cautioned me against). Dont forget that you are competing against a trillion other pieces of content out there. So you need a title to draw people in. Else you lose.\\nSteal. I dont quite mean it literally. But if you know a topic gets pageviews (and you arent hurting anyone) than steal it, no matter whos written about it or how many times youve written about it before. How I Screwed Yasser Arafat out of $2mm was able to nicely piggyback off of how amazingly popular Yasser Arafat is.\\nMake people cry. If youve ever been in love, you know how to cry. Bring readers to that moment when they were a child, and all of life was in front of them, except for that one bittersweet moment when everything began to change. If only that one moment couldve lasted forever. Please let me go back in time right now to that moment. But now its gone.\\nRelate to people. The past decade has totally sucked. For everyone. The country has been in post-traumatic stress syndrome since 9/11 and 2008 only made it worse. Ive gone broke a few times during the decade, had a divorce, lost friendships, and have only survived (barely) by being persistent and knowing I had two kids to take care of, and loneliness to fight. Nobodys perfect. Were all trying. Show people how you are trying and struggling. Nobody expects you to be a superhero.\\nTime heals all wounds. Everyone has experiences they dont want to write about. But with enough time, its ok. My New Years Resolution of 1995 is pretty embarrassing. But whatever. Its 16 years ago.. The longer back you go, the less you have to worry about what people think.\\nRisk. Notice that almost all of these rules are about where the boundaries are. Most people play it too safe. When you are really risking something and the reader senses that (and they WILL sense it), then you know you are in good territory. If you arent risking something, then Im moving on. I know Im on the right track if after I post something someone tweets, OMFG.\\nBe funny. You can be all of the above and be funny at the same time. When I went to India I was brutalized by my first few yoga classes (actually every yoga class). And I was intimidated by everyone around me. They were like yoga superheroes and I felt like a fraud around them. So I cried, and hopefully people laughed. It was also a case where I didnt have to dig into my past but I had an experience that was happening to me right then. How do you be funny? First rule of funny: ugly people are funny. Im naturally ugly so its easy. Make yourself as ugly as possible. Nobody wants to read that you are beautiful and doing great in life.\\nThe last line needs to go BOOM! . Your article is meaningless unless the last line KILLS. Read the book of short stories Jesus Son by Denis Johnson. Its the only way to learn how to do a last line. The last line should take you all the way back to the first line and then BOOM!\\nUse a lot of periods. Forget commas and semicolons. A period makes people pause. Your sentences should be strong enough that you want people to pause and think about it. This will also make your sentences shorter. Short sentences are good.\\nWrite every day. This is a must. Writing is spiritual practice. You are diving inside of yourself and cleaning out the toxins. If you dont do it every day, you lose the ability. If you do it every day, then slowly you find out where all the toxins are. And the cleaning can begin.\\nWrite with the same voice you talk in. Youve spent your whole life learning how to communicate with that voice. Why change it when you communicate with text?\\nDeliver value with every sentence. Even on a tweet or Facebook status update. Deliver poetry and value with ever word. Else, be quiet. (And, of course, follow me on twitter for more examples)\\nTake what everyone thinks and explore the opposite. Dont disagree just to disagree. But explore. Turn the world upside down. Guess what? There are people living in China. Plenty of times youll find value where nobody else did.\\nHave lots of ideas. I discuss this in How to be the Luckiest Man Alive in the Daily Practice section. Your idea muscle atrophies within days if you dont exercise it. Then what do you do? You need to exercise it every day until it hurts. Else no ideas.\\nSleep eight hours a day. Go to sleep before 9pm at least 4 days a week. And stretch while taking deep breaths before you write. We supposedly use only 5% of our brain. You need to use 6% at least to write better than everyone else. So make sure your brain is getting as much healthy oxygen as possible. Too many people waste valuable writing or resting time by chattering until all hours of the night.\\nDont write if youre upset at someone. Then the person you are upset at becomes your audience. You want to love and flirt with your audience so they can love you back.\\nUse said instead of any other word. Dont use he suggested or he bellowed. Just he said. Well figure it out if he suggested something.\\nPaint. Or draw. Keep exercising other creative muscles.\\nLet it sleep. Whatever you are working on, sleep on it. Then wake up, stretch, coffee, read, and look again. Rewrite. Take out every other sentence.\\nThen take out every other sentence again. Or something like that.\\nSanket didnt want to go to grad school after we graduated. He had another plan. Lets go to Thailand, he said. And become monks in a Buddhist monastery for a year. We can date Thai women whenever we arent begging for food, he said. It will be great and well get life experience.It sounded good to me.But then he got accepted to the University of Wisconsin and got a PhD. Now he lives in India and works for Oracle. And as for me, I dont know what the hell happened to me.]',\n",
       "  140: '[The police came when someone called in that I was causing a disturbance. I went upstairs and pretended to be asleep but they came up there anyway and said, Whats going on?Im asleep.Well, you have to get up. At the very least we have to take you to a motel. Were not allowed to let you stay here.My kids were either asleep or they were awake and hiding in their room. The lights were on up and down the street.The police took me to the back seat of their car. I had never been in the back seat of a police car. Its very tiny. Maybe its like what a very tall person must feel like on a plane with no leg room.They took me to a motel and told the manager to not let me leave the room all night. I then shook each of their hands and said, Thank you. I dont think they were expecting that.The next thing I knew I was awake and the sun was out and the room was spinning. I was still drunk from the night before. I closed my eyes a few times and may have gone in and out of sleep. Finally the room was no longer spinning.I got up and it was that feeling like the last day of 12th grade when you know you will never again have high school homework. The world in front of you is totally a mystery but has the scent of something completely different, terrifying, and hopeful.I walked across the street and found a coffee.No, wait, thats not really in my memories as Im trying to remember this.Maybe I only tried to find a coffee but nothing was open. I cant remember. It was a highway and nothing was even around. It was a Sunday and cars were barely out.It was autumn and the wind was a touch on my face. The exact way I would want someone to touch me if I were feeling lonely and scared and lost.Later, I was picked up, my kids were in the back seat. They never asked me about it again, even now when we pass that motel, which we often do on the way to movies, bookstores, diners, fun. Everyone looks away when we pass it.Well, again, Im sorry. Maybe thats not true. I dont know if they look away. I look away. Im ashamed.Often in a retelling theres a need to embellish with poetry. But people dont really look away from the worst accidents of their lives. They stare at them. They romanticize them. They wonder, is this where I hit bottom? Is this where I learned something.Maybe it was three months later after I was totally separated from my ex. It was Thanksgiving and I decided to go to a diner by myself and have a turkey sandwich. Almost like playing a joke on myself.Only I had an ulterior purpose in that I had a crush on the waitress. But she told me it was her last day and she was going to be a nursery school teacher and I didnt know yet how to tell her to take me with her. That I could just move into whatever new world she was creating for herself and maybe there I could re-create my self.I want to find someplace where I can say, this is where it happened. Where I said Help and everything changed.But it didnt happen like that. I dont really believe there is such a thing as hitting bottom. Maybe people hit a low point and decide they cant go lower. But theres always lower. For me there was much lower even after those moments.Its hard to decide for yourself  ok, now Im going to get better. At least for me. I never got better because of some decision I made.I wanted people to like me. I wanted to be a better father. I was scared to go broke, which has always been my worst fear, even a worse fear than loneliness or sickness or death.So I would stop drinking. Or I would read a lot. Or I would write. Or make calls to try to get involved in opportunities. I would pretend to be a big shot. How many times did I go on TV commenting on the stock market then? I was offered the CEO job at one company. I was on the board of another company.And then I would do a little bit more. Id write. I needed to have more ideas. I wrote down ideas every day. Id play in the sandbox of ideas. I started to sleep better. I started to feel grateful for what I had. I stopped being with people who brought me down. I started to surrender control of the things I could no longer control.Every day there was a little bit more of something. A shedding of another layer of skin and blood and disease to find something underneath that was real. Every day I was scared. I dont know if I ever hit bottom.And then opportunities started to happen.But I do know that every day I was blind and hungry and reaching higher, despite the misery and depression trying to pull me down.And sometimes Id purely by accident thunk my hand against another rung on the ladder.And for no reason at all that I can figure out now, Id clasp as tight as possible on that rung and pull myself a little bit higher. And, if given the chance, Ill still do that today.]',\n",
       "  141: '[Im on the board of directors of a company that provides temporary staffing services. They are a public company and over the past 12 months have had over $400 million in revenues, give or take (I should know the exact number but I dont and I dont like to stop writing to look things up). The company acts like a private company. They almost never talk to the media, they dont do any of the normal things that a public company should do. They just every day do their jobs.When I first heard about the company I thought to myself, sounds boring. No way am I going to get involved.But the more I learned about the company, the more fascinated I got. Everybody is getting fired these days. We are moving towards an employeeless society where eventually there will be no employees. Just temps.In 2008 the tide came in. Everyone got fired. And I do mean everyone. Right now the data says 7.8% unemployment but thats a lie. Most people got fired and then took jobs that paid lower in order to survive.I spoke with several CEOs in 2009. I asked them, be honest with me: you fired all of those people because everyone else was firing people so you had an easy excuse , its the economy! We cant help it! . 100% of the CEOs gave those nervous chuckles that they do and said, you got it.So we became, and we always will be, a world of temp-staffers, executives, and entrepreneurs. Everybody fits into one of those categories. Even if you think you are a permanent staffer, thats just a lie your employer is telling you. Theres no more loyalty. You are a temp. And eventually your payroll will be outsourced. And eventually you will be outsourced. So youre either ok with that, or you become an executive, or you figure out how to be an entrepreneur or work in a more entrepreneurial company.What does this have to do with your question. One of the things I think about being on this board (and Im not saying any private information. Just saying whats on my mind.) is what data does this company have that would be interesting to the media? Its not interesting if this company simply says, we got a new client. If revenues go up, thats great. But who cares.What would be interesting to the media is if theres some sort of correlation between changes in temporary staffing in different industries and how that part of the economy is doing. Or how those stocks will do in the future. I think a lot about what sort of data a staffing company with $400 million in revenues might have that I can play with statistically to see what has predictive value on the economy and on stocks. To me, that is interesting to the media. And I would know  having been around media for the past decade or so.Back to your question: figure out what you and only you know, based on the behavior of your customers and the data you are collecting on them, and how that can be organized to show something astonishing about human behavior, about the economy, about specific industries, whatever, and come up with a one page way you can share that with the media.One company that I used to be an investor in until it was sold to Salesforce.com was Buddy Media, which sells software that companies use to manage their Facebook presence. I see them quoted in the media everywhere. Not because they get new customers (boring!) or they have a new product release (even more boring!) but because they put out a report about when the best time to post to Facebook was. What time of day, what day of the week, would get a user the most engagement. I actually think their data is wrong based on my own experience. But it doesnt matter. That report is everywhere. And it got them press and got them more customers.The site plentyoffish.com, a dating site, does this very well. They have huge data, millions of pieces of data, on what sort of men and women are attracted to each other, and what sort of men and women build lasting relationships. It doesnt take psychology to figure it all out. They figured it out with data. And they share that with the press. The press eats it up every single time, and plentyoffish.com gets a new boost in traffic. Like clockwork.Be the clock. Do the work.

       "  142: \"[My kids dont know who the Rolling Stones are. They dont care either. And why should they? Setting aside the common argument every generation makes with the generation after it (our music is better than yours) what can distinguish Mick Jagger from, say, Selena Gomez, who they admire? Or Adele? Or any of the other musicians that they could listen to all day long (after covering their ears if I play any music from the 60s, 70s, 80s, or 90s.)Heres what I get curious about:\\nHow did the band survive for 50 years. They are about to go on tour again. More than 50 years after they first started. Same front man: Mick Jagger. Same guy on guitar: Keith Richards. Same guy on drums: Charlie Watts. Drugs, divorces, deaths, diseases, debt  they just kept going. Unlike their peers: The Beatles, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin. How do they keep going? What made them different. They dont even like each other that much if you believe the ramblings in Keith Richards autobiography, Life. Its hard to like people for 50 years straight. I have a hard time being around the same people for 24 hours, let alone 50 years.\\nHow did they succeed? And create? What made them stand out? So many times you hear a young band and they just sound like every other band. Nothing unique. Nothing that makes you want to say, 50 years from now Im still going to be listening to them.\\nA) History of the profession (obsession with the Blues). They all met and bonded because they were obsessed not with Rock (Elvis, the Beatles, etc) but with the Blues (Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, etc). The bands name The Rolling Stones comes from the song Rollin Stone written by Muddy Waters. In fact, almost all of their initial songs, performances, and initial song releases were all covers of Chicago Blues bands. When they first started they were just a blues cover band with no idea that they would be writing original music. Their first hit to get into the top 10 for instance was a cover of a Buddy Holly song.But its an obsession with the history of music that brought them together. Richards and Jagger, childhood friends who lost touch, ran into each other at a busstop when they were about 18 and Jagger was carrying a Chuck Berry record. Richards recognized a kindred spirit and they were inseparable after that.(Jagger inducting The Beatles into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. Click the image for video.)B) Intersection of Blues and Rock. They didn't remain just Blues. In fact, they were like the Borg and kept assimilating every musical style that came after them.Someone once asked me: what is better: to be good at a lot of things or GREAT at one thing. The answer is exemplified by the Rolling Stones  they were good at EVERY style of music and thus became the GREATEST at the intersection of all of those styles. While the Beatles combined pop/Elvis/early rock, the Rolling Stones covered those forms plus Blues and R&amp;B (and Jaggers leg motions certainly had an Elvis influence and the band even had a strong Beatles influence (see below).Things like this remind me of Bobby Fischer and chess. When he was kid he was considered a talented young chessplayer but certainly not the best ever. Not even the best young player ever. So he did what he normally did when he needed to take a step up. He disappeared. This was around the age of 13. He did a comprehensive study of all the games played in the 1800s. When he returned to play, he would play these old-fashioned openings from the 1850s but hed throw in his own subtle improvements that he had developed. Within a year or so he was easily US Champion and on his way to being World Champion (after disappearing again and learning Russian so he could read all the Russian chess magazines).I think of the bands that stand out for me now. I was just listening to Gotan Project, which combines old-school tango music with a more techno feel. Or creators like Steve Jobs who so effectively combined design with technology (not only with Apple but with Pixar) in ways that had never been done before. Its hard to be the greatest at any one endeavor, but by combining passions its not as hard to be the greatest in the world at the intersections of those passions (because there are billions of things that can intersect, you can find your own place in the long tail of passion to be the master of).Its hard to call Sympathy for the Devil or Paint it Black rock, or blues, or any other musical style. The only way to describe it is that its the musical style that the Stones defined by carving out the intersection of several styles. Its worth noting that even though they continued to assimilate future styles in the decades to come, its these initial songs (and several others) that they wrote in the 60s and early 70s that continue to be played over and over again  the results of their initial passions and first loves.Its also interesting that he not only found himself the greatest at various intersections of music but also literature. After reading Mikhail Bulgakovs novel The Master and the Margarita (which had the line of Satan being a man of wealth and taste) Jagger wrote the lyrics for Sympathy for the Devil.C) Persistence/Rejection. People didnt like Jaggers voice. The band was constantly rejected. Their initial songs didnt make the top charts. Their record label, Decca, did zero promotion for their first release. And reviewers couldnt stand Jaggers voice. Very ordinary. I cant hear a word Jaggers saying, said one reviewer.Fuzzy and undisciplined complete chaos, said another.It was also no secret he couldnt play any instruments (at that time). So they simply werent the best band out there. But they kept playing and they also had the extra quality of Jaggers charisma, which seemed above and beyond the talent of the band by itself. At the time the band was run by Brian Jones, who was the first person to eventually quit the band (in 1969) and basically the last person of the original guys to quit (well, 35 years later Bill Wyman retired but Jagger, Watts, Richards are all from the original band and will all tour later this year).Given that Jones was running things, it took awhile for The Rolling Stones to realize that Jagger was the attraction. Nevertheless, they didnt let rejection stop them. It was several years of playing before they started hitting the charts and several more before they were touring and making good money.My theory always in any career start or career change is that it takes 1-3 years to do the studying required. About 2 years before you are making any money at the new career. 3-4 years before you are making a living from it and 5-6 years before you are killing it. But it requires persistence each day.D) A generation of artists grows up together- Im always amazed at how groups of artists, businessmen, creators of any sort, basically grow up together in their respective businesses. In writing, look at Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William S Burroughs, all hanging out together years before any of their books reached any kind of acclaim. Or Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Or in the art world, Jasper Johns, John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg, all living on basically the same block in downtown New York, exploring the art scene of the 50s.It was no different for the Rolling Stones. There was one concert where lack of any money forced them all to hitch rides together with young musicians Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin), Eric Clapton, etc on the way to see The Beatles in concert.One time Jagger and Richards decided they needed to start writing their own music. They had no idea where to start. They simply couldnt write music. So Andrew Oldham was wandering around outside and ran into Paul McCartney and John Lennon and explained the problem. Lennon and McCartney went up to the apartment Jagger and Richards shared and basically riffed out I Wanna Be Your Man to help the Stones put together the release that was their first major hit.(announcing their next tour, 50 years after their first)E) Never say NO. The Stones said yes to everything. They would perform 200 places a year for almost no money in the beginning. The just kept saying yes, even if it meant playing to crowds of just four or five people. This reminds me of when The Beatles were playing almost 20 hours a day, 7 days a week at strip clubs in Hamburg, West Germany from 1960 to 1962. It was the non-stop playing that gave them experience and mastery. Gladwell refers to this in his excellent book, Outliers as when the Beatles got their 10,000 hours in order to achieve mastery before they hit it big.For early entrepreneurs this can translate to saying yes to every networking opportunity, every meeting that can result in down-the-road potential for customers, investors, acquirers, and great future employees. Most meetings are complete wastes of time. But I think it takes going to lots of meetings to build the bullshit detector to determine what is a waste of time and what isnt. That said, you can still learn from 100% of the meetings. Sergey Brin, for instance, used to interview every potential Google employee. He explained later that he knew within seconds whether he would hire someone or not and would then spend the rest of the meeting trying to learn at least one new thing from the interviewee so the meeting wouldnt be a total waste of time.With Jagger, the ability to say YES to everything also translated to the inability to say NO to anything. He originally felt he would retire from the Stones when he was 33  I couldnt bear to end up as an Elvis Presleyand sing to all those old ladies coming in with their handbags. Well, now hes 70 and just announced his new tour.It is this which ultimately help the group together. The band members loyalty to nothing (family, friends, other art pursuits) other than the band. They were addicts but the biggest addiction they had was adulation to this entity they created. For better or worse, since it made them all an enormous amount of money.F) Content is just the trunk of the tree. Then there are a 1000 branches. People all the time ask me how you make money from writing a blog. Or writing a book. There really is no way. Most authors will tell you the fastest way to go broke is to spend years writing a book. Same goes for blogs. But you use the content you create as a launching pad. In the case of blogs  speaking gigs, consulting gigs, multiple books, subscription products, etc. Ive seen some bloggers make millions not off of their blogs but off of the ancillary activities that happened because they built up their platform through blogging, tweeting, facebooking, etc.The Stones are no different. They dont even own most of their successful music. Like many musicians from the 60s or earlier, they mistakenly signed away all of the rights to their music without even realizing it. The songs you know: Paint it Black, Sympathy, Satisfaction, You Cant Always Get What You Want, and on and on had their rights signed away to their manager Allen Klein. So they dont make any money off of those. And how many people can name Stones songs written in the 80s? I cant. (well, State of Shock that Mick Jagger did with Michael Jackson. But thats it).So how did they make any money?Tours. They made over $600 million on their last tour. They form a company at the beginning of each tour, collect all the revenues of the tour (thanks to Jaggers businesslike abilities acquired from attending the London School of Economics before the band started) which includes sponsorships, tickets, clothing, record sales, etc. and then they dividend out the proceeds at the end of the tour. All taking home a nice paycheck. Jagger was analytical on every aspect of the business, even inquiring with managers about which currency would be stronger, the pound or the dollar over time.Theyve done over 40 tours, with four of their tours appearing in the list of top 10 grossing tours of all time. Their last tour (which ended in 2007) was at #2, exceeded only by U2s tour from last year which grossed over $700 million. Interesting to note that Lady Gagas most successful tour grossed only $234 million, but it can be argued she didnt have to split it as many ways and still has a long career ahead of her.By the way, for my friends who write non-fiction books  Ive seen people write best sellers to non-sellers BUT the ONLY way (even for the bestsellers) that Ive seen serious money being made by authors that I know is by either doing tours of speaking gigs after the book comes out (far exceeding whatever they got in advances) or by selling information products which complement the value they deliver in their books.The Rolling Stones is not my favorite band. Some of their songs are among my favorites but Ive never bought an album and I dont think Ive ever bought any of their songs. Ive never seen them on tour. I barely know anything about them. But Im fascinated by their longevity, the birth of their creativity, the glue that stuck them together and propelled them from despair to success, and ultimately the magic of creativity that infects anyone who reaches the status they reached. I hope one day in my own way to achieve a tiny sliver of that.]\",\n",
       "  143: '[I called my parents to borrow a few hundred dollars. Two years earlier I had $15 milllion cash in the bank. Now I had $0 in the bank. ZERO. I had started and sold a company. I had been a venture capitalist. Now, in my mind, I was the worst loser possible. I didnt have enough money to feed my kids. I was 34 years old and had to go back to mommy and daddy for some money.For their own reasons, they said no. I was worried I wouldnt have enough to buy diapers for my two daughters. They said no. I was worried I would run out and not be able to buy food for my family. They said no.I didnt want to argue. I hung up the phone. They tried to call back. I yelled out, dont pick up. They tried sending me email messages over the next few months. During that time I moved into financial exile 70 miles north of the city. I barely left my house. I gained 20 pounds. I asked one store owner, randomly why the world always felt like it was going to end and she just stared at me.I started a new career, having nothing to do with older careers I was in. I had to. I had to make some money or still my family would die. Not just me, but my whole family. After a few months of exile I started to leave my house a little. I would swing on a swingset at five in the morning. Or shoot baskets by the river while the sun rose. I never slept. I would say to myself, this is what it feels like to disappear. When I remember it now it felt like it was always snowing. That I couldnt move because there was nothing but gray and snow.My dad sent me emails. I never answered them. I went on TV once. He sent me an email, you looked good on TV. I didnt answer him. I was trying to start a new career. I was in a permanent state of fear.After eight months,I got a call from my sister, Dad had a stroke. When? Two days ago. I drove to see him. He had tubes and the usual sticking out of every place in him. Over two years later he died without ever speaking again. So when I hung up on him eight months before his stroke, it was the last time I spoke to him.This isnt a story about loving the people around you, even in your worst moment. Nor is it a story about talking to your parents or about regrets. Its a story that even when things feel like they are at their worst, even when emotion hits bottoms you never even knew existed, you will come back if you persist through them.If you stay healthy, if you love yourself, if you are grateful for the tiniest things that push you forward, if you keep the past in the past, if you close off the fears of the future, if right now you live live LIVE.I am here now.

       "  144: '[I didnt have any money so couldnt start a business. And even if I started one, I didnt have an office, or clients, and I was too shy to cold-call clients. I didnt have connections or rich parents or anything for that matter.I didnt have talent. I just got lucky. Nobody will hire me. I dont have the right equipment. I couldnt write a book because I had no publisher. I couldnt do stand-up because I was afraid people would heckle me. Im afraid to write a blog post often because what would people think?All of my excuses turned out to be blessings in disguise. Theres always a gap between what I have now and what I would like.The gap is all of your excuses. All it takes to close the gap is to be creative and work your way through the excuses. I repeat: this is ALL IT TAKES.Your excuses are simply the roadmap that takes you from here to there. Good luck on your travels.Below are some types of excuses that Ive had in the past and still have. You should make your own list. Please put whatever common excuses I miss in the comments.Its very exciting to see because excuses are pointers to where the target is. There are no other pointers other than your list of excuses. The excuses are the map to success and fulfillment. Its fun to take a blank piece of paper and draw out the map. Put roads, mountains, buildings, rivers, obstacles, and destinations in there.I Dont Have MoneyWhen I started my first business, called Reset, I had no money in the bank at all. And I had a very low salary at HBO. Oh, and I had a full-time job.It was brutal. I had to get very creative about finding computers to use and reaching out to friends and family to tell them what my skill set was and what sorts of clients would be great for me (Answer: anyone who needed anything, I would help for a fee).So my solution was to make sure everyone knew what my skills were and why they were needed.Then I carved out time (weekends, nights, days when I could hide) to do the work for clients until I was ready to jump to full-time entrepreneur (by that point there were almost 10 employees).I Dont Have EquipmentI met a friend of mine yesterday. We spoke about people doing YouTube videos who are making a living from all the views and advertising they generate.Id do it but I dont have the right camera.I said to him, You want to borrow my phone? Because any phone in the world has a camera a thousand times better than what you need for YouTube.I asked him what else was getting in the way.Theres always a good reason and the real reason, I told him. You just gave me a bullshit good reason. What do you think the real reason is?And he thought about it and told me. Laziness. I get that. Im lazy also.So take your phone camera. And practice executing. Pick an easy video to do. Go to the 42nd Street subway and videotape the guys playing underground there and upload it. Just get into the rhythm of making a video and uploading it. Then, write down ideas every day about more and more fun videos you can do. Its a quantity game.Will he do it? I dont know. We love our excuses. They are just as much our babies as our ideas are.I Dont Have TimeLets say you are a single mother with three kids and a full-time job. You might not have time to write Harry Potter.Its really harsh. But you find the time. You stop TV. Or skip a meal (nobody in America will ever starve by skipping a meal, I will put my medical seal of approval on that statement. Because although I do not have a medical degree, I play a doctor on Facebook).The magic of excuses is that there is always a way to be creative around them. The excuses are the map to your success. We all have obstacles.You can view the obstacle as an opportunity to grow or as an obstacle to stop.The good news is you get to choose.Im Not Good EnoughI need one more year to get better, to learn how to code, to learn financial stuff, to learn and the excuses go on. I cant start a company until.Everyone in every field in the history of the world has at one point said Im not good enough.Its how you overcome that excuse that not only makes you good enough, but matures you into the person who knows how to get good enough. So you can do it again and again.I Dont Have A DegreeI get emails every day. Id like to work at Google but I dont have degree. Or, Id like to be a success but I dont have an MBA.And its not just degrees. I get emails from people who think they need yoga teacher certification. Or a medical degree (you can be a healer without writing prescriptions). Or any flimsy piece of paper that ultimately is no indicator of value.Googles HR person even just announced that GPAs in school are a waste to look at. And that more and more of their hires have no college degrees at all!The world is changing and you have to grasp it now.It used to be that a stranger knew he could cooperate with you if you had that stupid piece of paper.But now there are many ways you can show you can deliver value even without that paper.Come up with 10 ideas how you can escape the trap of the degree and demonstrate you still have value. Ideas for the company you want to work for, or the person you want to work with. Or just go get a camera and start making movies without a film degree.When Andy Samberg was starting at Saturday Night Live he didnt just huddle in the writers room with everyone else and try to come up with jokes. Too much competition!He took a camera, with his buddies Jorm and Akiva, and went out and shot Lazy Sunday, which was the first YouTube video to get over 100,000,000 views and became his first SNL Digital Short.He didnt wait to rise through the ranks and hopefully get a joke or a sketch produced. He went out and produced it himself.Before Macklemores Thrift Shop rap song got a billion views on YouTube he turned down every record label. He realized he didnt need them. Didnt need the validation they have provided for over 60 years to generations of artists.The distribution is here to reach the world no matter what your field is.You validate yourself now through your work.Im Not In The Right LocationI moved from Pittsburgh to New York because I thought it would put me closer to the publishing industry. Some people move to Silicon Valley to get funding for their startup. I had one friend who felt she needed to live in Paris before she could paint.I know many people who think they need to own a home before they could really have roots and start creating.All of these are good reasons but not the real reasons.The only thing that will get people to see your work is not where you live but if you actually do the work.When I built Stockpickr.com I spent less than $5,000 and probably never left my basement, 80 miles north of NYC.I was afraid all the time. It was the 10th website I was trying to launch and the previous nine failed.I had no idea if it would be good or bad. But it took off and in the second month had almost a million visitors and then kept growing until I sold it to thestreet.com just five months later.It kept breaking down (I couldnt afford good programmers), one employee working on it quit (I couldnt pay him), and I realized too late that it had three or four decent competitors.Thats okay. I also loved doing it and I wanted to create what would be the ideal site for someone like me interested in finance. So it worked. No matter that I was in a dark basement the entire time with no money and nobody to make me laugh.And guess what the fastest-growing city in the U.S. is. Williston, North Dakota.I Dont Have The Right Network I am a bad cold caller. With my first business, Reset, I cold-called a bank and asked them if I could do their website. My only in: I said I had a checking account there. They laughed and told me to call them back in a few years. A few years! I had payroll to make!Lewis Howes described to me on my podcast how he would make all of these LinkedIn connections and then invite them all out to open-bar parties where they could network.He created his network by introducing everyone else to each other. He was simply that guy in the middle. You want to be that guy.You get a network by:\\nIntroducing people to others who can provide value for them. Make sure its permission networking (you get permission from both sides first. Else you are a burden and not a help).\\nIntroducing people to ideas without any expectation back. This means you have to get good at coming up with ideas.\\nFinding a connection in between you and the other person. A connection they might value. In Lewiss case he contacted many former athletes. Sometimes people use their hometowns or schools. Sometimes people use mutual friends, etc.\\nBuilding a network from scratch requires three to four hours a day of work. What if you have a job?Well, build your network at work. The way to do this: ask to lunch the secretaries of people in different divisions. Come up with ideas for the heads of different divisions. Do one thing a day to help someone in your work group that you didnt have to reach out to.Networks build exponentially and not linearly. Once one person is in your network, one single person, then everyone in their network is potentially in yours. Make use of that.I dont have a network is a beautiful excuse because it means that if you overcome this excuse you are going to meet many amazing friends who you will know and love throughout your career. I know this because my network has changed 100% in the past five years, starting from total scratch.Every day I bow down to how powerful this one excuse was to motivate me into making such great and wonderful new friends.Its Too CrazyRodney Dangerfield was an aluminum siding salesman. But he wanted to return to his old career as a standup comedian. I think he was about 50 years old. Maybe older. It was crazy for him to think he could be a success. I dont know what was going through his head.But whatever it was, he did the smart thing. He opened up his own comedy club: Dangerfields. It became the most popular comedy club in NYC and many famous comedians got their starts there (e.g. Jim Carrey).But who would deny him if he wanted to go on stage there? And it was there that he developed his craft more and more until he was basically the ugliest most obscene movie star ever.As an aside: I once asked Dangerfield what was the craziest thing that ever happened to him at three in the morning. Without missing a beat he said, her husband came home!A.J. Jacobs wants to create the worlds largest family reunion. Thats crazy! Over 4,000 people. But every day he takes tiny steps closer. (For one thing, we found out through DNA testing that we are cousins, as is his wife!). He also found a venue. A publisher is going to publish a book about it. Hes getting sponsors. Every day, new answers to the Thats Crazy! excuse.Dr. Wayne W. Dyer had a tenure-track position at a college. He was in his late 30s. He was set for life. Instead, he quit, loaded up the back of his car with a self-help book he wrote, and drove across the country leaving his books at every bookstore. Everyone he knew thought he was crazy. He sold over 100,000,000 copies of that book, Your Erroneous Zones.Many things might be too crazy. But Ive been in business now for 20 years. I have helped over 300 companies get financed. Ive started and sold (and gone broke too many times) many companies. I have seen the craziest things happen. People rise from unbelievably bleak and desperate ashes to be the one flower in a graveyard to blossom. The sun is always there. But the flower has to be ready to blossom.Its too Crazy is a roadmap. Start with that phrase and circle it. Then draw all the roads that lead out from that spot. They dont all have to end up at the place you expect. Have fun with it. Find different roads and see where they lead.Some will end up in Oz. But some will end up in even more magical places than you could have expected.I Dont Have TalentNeither did Mick Jagger. He had a weird voice and couldnt play an instrument. But he loved the blues and wanted to put his spin on it with the help of Keith Richards and others. And he worked it. It turned out he had this weird sort of charisma that kept the fans coming back.But he never would have found that out if he hadnt played every night at the seedy underground clubs where he would bang out his horrible music.Thats okay. He wouldve finished his degree at the London School of Economics and become a respectable accountant somewhere.Instead, hes MICK JAGGER.Its widely agreed that the best chess player ever, Bobby Fischer, didnt have that much talent. He was above average but maybe not world-class. He had to figure out his own particular roadmap to success.We each can draw our own unique roadmaps. How exciting it is to make an atlas to places youve never been and then try to travel across it.Fischer did three things:\\nHe studied games from 100 years earlier and came up with improvements to each one. So when people played him and found themselves in positions similar, he would know the special tricks to use and they wouldnt.\\nHe learned Russian so he could read the Russian chess magazines to learn the latest openings that none of his U.S. opponents knew.\\nHe played speed chess every day with his teacher, strong master Jack Collins.\\nThen he came out of nowhere (he had literally disappeared from the scene) and became the youngest U.S. champion ever. Then the strongest player ever.* * *Im sure there are many excuses Im missing. And many examples. Please, please put them in the comments (put your personal examples also) because I want my daughters to learn from this post.Remember to always tune your inner ear so you can listen for (and separate from each other) both the GOOD reason and the REAL reason when anyone (including yourself) gives you an excuse.Most people dont tune that inner ear. They believe the excuses because its easy. Because it gives them permission not to do something they love. Fine. I understand that also. I give myself permission every day to miss out on some opportunities because I choose others.Thats why on your roadmap of excuses, some excuses dont have many roads coming out of them. They dont need an extra traffic circle or bridge because their port is not in use much.This article is for my children. I know they will have excuses as they climb each rung on the ladders of age, success, frustration, relationships, spirituality and health. I want them to know that the best things that ever happened to me were my excuses.Each excuse let me learn about myself, and let me discover entire worlds of surprising possibilities. Each one led me to more and more love  love of people, love of passions, love of hidden subtleties in every day happenings, and even love of excuses.But I want my kids to not go through some of the pains that I have gone through. It really sucks to be so sad you dont know if you can last another day.

       "  145: '[I got a death threat from a guy who is a senior at Brown University who didnt think I could track him down. More on that in a second. The first thing I want to deal with is the question asked me the other day, how do you make a personal brand. When I hear the words personal brand I think someone is going to lie to me and then try to take all of my money. Personal branding, I guess, is descended from the mockery called corporate branding.The Coca-Cola company, for instance, loves the drug, Ecstasy. My favorite TV commercial is not the 1984 Apple commercial (although thats a close number two) but a commercial for Coke Zero (Coke Zero Roller Girl). It takes a song that was originally written by Paul Oakenfold. The original topic of the song was about how great it was to take the drug Ecstasy and go to a rave. Anything could happen.  There would be pretty girls, great music, and at the end of the night, total communion with nature. In the commercial, though, theres a girl roller-blading. She looks like shes on the boardwalk in Santa Monica. The song is playing in the background. Shes not taking Ecstasy but drinking Coke Zero. She dances/roller-blades around her studly friends, her beautiful girlfriends, and it ends with everyone taking Coke Zero, the fizz going up like a group ejaculation into the sky. Coke Zero  the brand where you can find your own personal ecstasy.I WANT THATWhenever I watch that commercial I feel like I want a life like that: free from worry, stress, free from thinking about money or petty jealousies. Surrounded by friends and beautiful people. Moving without effort, the ocean in the background. As they say in the song: once again, I find myself with my friends. Coke Zero tells me the dream is possible even though intellectually I know its a myth. Freedom isnt found that way. But were willing, as a culture, to accept the lies that Coke tells us. And they are willing to use songs about drugs to help us accept those lies.(from the 1971 commercial \"I\\'d like to Buy the World a Coke\"  another personal favorite) Perhaps Coke figured out that maybe this time they had gone too far. They pulled the commercial. Sometimes I can find it on YouTube. Sometimes I cant. They try hard to make it disappear.What they never explain is that coke zero is essentially brown-dyed water with about 16 teaspoons of fake sugar in it and add a little bit of CO2 and you make it fizz. Thats the secret formula thats locked in a safe in some bank in Atlanta. I can make SuperJamesCola with that formula. But then I cant license that music, get those sexy girls, and run that ad on the Super Bowl and a thousand other places. I cant do corporate branding by myself.\\n \\n(the \"secret\" formula)But no matter  lets move past the artificially safe confines of corporate America. Thats dead and if you havent planned your exit strategy yet you will have to soon enough.SO WHAT IS PERSONAL BRANDING?So now I keep hearing about personal branding - the idea that your career, your mind, your body, everything that makes up the superficial you can be packaged up into a brand just like Coke or Mcdonalds can. With the spectrum of pornography allowed by Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Google+, etc etc etc a personal brand can evolve and grow like any superbowl ad. Kim Kardashians didnt have an answer when Barbara Walters asked her, finally, but arent you really just known for a sex tape? when Kim initially tried to re-brand herself as a businesswoman in a very intimate interview. So we start to arrive at the truth of the matter: Branding is lying.But personal branding is even worse because the joke is over. Now were talking about me and you. Were talking about who YOU are. And lets face it. Its not pretty. You need to re-brand from birth.People confuse honesty with a type of happiness. He can be honest because he is happy. But its not true. Life is a series of failures punctuated by brief successes. Thats honesty. Failure is not necessarily bad. Its reality.But branding tries to reverse that. With a personal brand, you suddenly pretend to be super successful, a businesswoman in Kardashians case  failure is non-existent, and out of your mind comes the exact mathematical formulas that if someone drinks your Cola and snorts your Ecstasy then they too will have the pretty girl, the success, the money, the accoutrements.A FRIEND OF MINE WHO DOES PERSONAL BRANDINGI know a stockbroker who sends a Christmas card every year to his clients. He wants to present an aura of success. Each time hes in some other blue lagoon on some random part of the world, with a blonde girl (different each Christmas) with huge fake breasts and they are snorkeling or hugging in the water (blue blue aqua) or staring off into a beautiful mediterranean ancient city. He makes money. Lots of it.And you cant even look at him, the girl is so beautiful and her eyes are staring at him and shes kissing him and its all over his Facebook page. His status might even be engaged and she has an exotic name.The only problem is, and you cant tell anyone because this is the beautiful part he is telling me in his tell-all because hes a good friend and knows I will never reveal his name: is that hes gay. He picks up his boyfriends in dungeons. Hes been smothered in concrete until he was unable to move and holes would be poked through so he could breathe, and only then with a boy whipping him and arranging this unusual punishment, would his copulation come to completion.* * *Honesty is about the scars. its about the blemishes. But its more than just bragging about failure, which could be a form of ego. Its about truly helping people.Theres 1 trillion websites competing against each other. The most honest website of all? Google. Google cant help you with your problems. If you suspect you might have herpes after a particularly courageous night out on the town, going to Google will not help you (although you may feel a vague feeling of remorse when you see the Im Feeling Lucky button).Google has no content on it at all. But Google is honest about that. You just walked into their store and said, Please, help me  do you have anything to prevent a potential outbreak of herpes and Google will say, quite honestly, im sorry, I cant help you, but here are ten of my competitors who can potentially help you. And, by the way, here are three more of my competitors who MIGHT be able to help you but, in full disclosure, they are paying me to tell you this. And then Google shrugs its shoulders. Thats all they can do for you.But thats honesty. Thats not branding. So youll come back to them. Because they are a straight shooter and the target was on your head. And when you need to know about that growth behind your ear, or what the best software is for keystroke logging, they will say the same thing: sorry, we cant help you  but we can direct you to at least ten of our competitors who seem pretty decent at it.With honesty theyve set themselves free. Heres the thing about a brand. It puts you in jail. You know who had the original patent that Larry Page tweaked into the PageRank that made Google (and separately, that Robin Li ALSO tweaked into the patent that became Baidu?) Ill tell you: Dow Jones. The Wall Street Journal.[See, \"10 Unusual Things About Google\"]They knew how to make Google years before Larry Page even thought of the idea. But they didnt do it. Why? Because their brand says they dont give out stuff for free. Their brand says that everything you need to know is trapped inside something with the Wall Street Journal or Dow Jones trademarks printed on it and if its not there then its not anywhere. Branding jails corporate America but honesty sets entrepreneurs free.* * *WHAT WILL HONESTY GET YOU?#1: PEOPLE WILL STOP SPEAKING TO YOUForget personal branding. Start to dip your toes into personal honesty. Let me tell you what will happen. Your family might stop speaking to you.I have experienced this not just from myself but all of the bloggers I consider honest bloggers. Some of your friends will also stop speaking to you. Some of your colleagues will avoid you. Some investors will shun you. Your personal network will transform and shift.My own personal motto is: honesty to a point. I will never harm anyone. I believe in what Buddha said to his son Rahula the day after he showed up after abandoning his son for 7 years: before, during, and even AFTER you say something, make sure it doesnt hurt anyone.But even despite that rule, people will stop speaking to you because not every hurt you can control. Historical is hysterical for many people.#2 PEOPLE WILL THINK YOU ARE GOING TO KILL YOURSELFThe next thing that will happen is people will ask are you killing yourself? Because every blog post almost seems like a suicide note. #3 PEOPLE WILL THINK YOU ARE CRAZYThen people will send emails to your friends, is he as crazy as he sounds? And thats how I make friends now because introductions will be made and people will have to find out for themselves.#4 PEOPLE WILL GET FRIGHTENEDSo they will call you names. Oh, that guy is just trying to be a contrarian, for instance. Or an idiot. Or worse. Ive been called everything. I had to call the Brown University Public Safety office the other day because I got emailed a death threat and the guy didnt think I could track him. The guy was a senior and had also apparently threatened the life of a librarian there.They need to understand why you are telling the truth. Why you are being honest about what you really think. In meetings at the office everyone is quiet. Youre not supposed to speak up. So people will dislike you, try to put you down, post comments, whatever. In many cases (but not all) these are what I call crappy people. And heres how to deal with them. #5 PEOPLE WILL FIND YOU ENTERTAININGThen finally, people will come back to you. Because youre entertaining  if 20000 people are lying and only 1 person is telling the truth then that 1 person is going to stand taller than anyone. At first people will come back to you for voyeuristic reasons. Why? Because they know if they watch Real Housewives they arent watching anything Real and they arent watching Housewives. But youre real. So they want to know what youll do next.#6 PEOPLE WILL TRUST YOUR ADVICEPeople will also come back for advice. Not always because they agree with you. But because they know the advice is coming from the heart and not because there is anything for sale. Its like Google cant cure anything. But they can direct you to all the people who can. So you go back to Google because you might not always find what you want but at least you know they are trying hard to direct you to the right place.Weve all hidden our failures in dark comets orbiting the peripheral edges of the solar system, where the sun is dark and faded. But when someone brings their orbit close to the sun we want to land there for a brief moment and see if actual living conditions exist. And if so, then maybe a small settlement can be formed, advice can be asked, a failure can be related to, a friendship can be formed.(freedom)#7 YOU BECOME FREEAt first we hug our boundaries in chains. We think if we tell the girl we like her, she might not like me back. We think, If I say I like this candidate, my friends might hate me. If I say X, everyone else might say Y. And so on. But more and more we start to feel where those boundaries are and we push them out. We push them further and further away from ourselves. Until finally they are so far away its as if they dont exist at all. You dont need money for that. Or a big house. Or a fancy degree or car. Every day, just push out those boundaries a little further.We reach for that freedom. We never truly get there. Were always striving to see how far they can go, just like a little child with her parents. But eventually, the boundaries are so far away we begin to feel the pleasures of true freedom.And it feels good.]',\n",
       "  146: '[Im pretty mediocre. Im ashamed to admit it. Im not even being sarcastic or self-deprecating. Ive never done anything that stands out as, Whoa! This guy made it into outerspace! Orthis guy has a best selling novel! Orif only Google had thought of this! Ive had some successes and some failures, but never reached any of the goals I had initially set.Ive started a bunch of companies. Sold some. Failed at most. Ive invested in a bunch of startups. Sold some, failed at some, and the jury is still sequestered on a few others. Ive written some books, most of which I no longer like (except the ones you get when you sign up for my newsletter). I can tell you overall, though, everything I have done has been distinguished by its mediocrity and lack of a grand vision, and any success Ive had can be just as much put in the luck basket as the effort basket.That said, all people should be so lucky. We cant all be grand visionaries. We cant all be Picassos. We want to make our business, make our art, sell it, make some money, raise a family, and try to be happy. My feeling, based on my own experience, is that aiming for grandiosity is the fastest route to failure. For every Mark Zuckerberg there are 1,000 Jack Zuckermans. Who is Jack Zuckerman? I have no idea. Thats my point. If you are Jack Zuckerman and are reading this, I apologize. You aimed for the stars and missed. Your re-entry into the atmosphere involved a broken heat shield and you burned to a crisp by the time you hit the ocean. Now we have no idea who you are.If you want to get rich, sell your company, have time for your hobbies, raise a halfway decent family (with mediocre children, etc.), and enjoy the sunset with your wife on occasion, here are some of my highly effective recommendations. PROCRASTINATIONIn between the time I wrote the last sentence and the time I wrote this one I played (and lost) a game of chess. My king and my queen got forked by a knight. But hey, that happens. Fork me once, shame on me, etc. Procrastination is your body telling you you need to back off a bit and think more about what you are doing. When you procrastinate as an entrepreneur it could mean that you need a bit more time to think about what you are pitching a client. It could also mean you are doing work that is not your forte and that you are better off delegating.I find that many entrepreneurs are trying to do everything when it would be cheaper and more time-efficient to delegate, even if there are monetary costs associated with that. In my first business, it was like a lightbulb went off in my head the first time I delegated a programming job to someone other than me. At that time, I went out on a date, which was infinitely better than me sweating all night on some stupid programming bug (thank you, Chet, for solving that issue).Try to figure out why you are procrastinating. Maybe you need to brainstorm more to improve an idea. Maybe the idea is no good as is. Maybe you need to delegate. Maybe you need to learn more. Maybe you dont enjoy what you are doing. Maybe you dont like the client whose project you were just working on. Maybe you need to take a break. Theres only so many seconds in a row you can think about something before you need to take time off and rejuvenate the creative muscles. This is not for everyone. Great people can storm right through. Steve Jobs never needed to take a break. But I do.Procrastination could also be a strong sign that you are a perfectionist. That you are filled with shame issues. This will block you from building and selling your business. Examine your procrastination from every side. Its your body trying to tell you something. Listen to it.ZERO-TASKINGTheres a common myth that great people can multi-task efficiently. This might be true, but I cant do it. I have statistical proof. I have a serious addiction. If you ever talk on the phone with me, theres almost 100% chance I am simultaneously playing chess online. The phone rings and one hand reaches for the phone and the other hand reaches for the computer to initiate a one minute game. Chess rankings are based on a statistically generated rating system, so I can compare easily how well I do when Im the phone compared with when Im not on the phone. There is a three standard deviation difference. Imagine if I were talking on the phone and driving, or responding to emails. Its the same thing Im assuming: phone calls cause a three standard deviation subtraction in intelligence. And thats the basic multi-tasking we all do at some point or other.So great people can multitask but since, by definition, most of us are not great (99% of us are not in the top 1%), its much better to single-task. Just do one thing at a time. When you wash your hands, hear the sound of the water, feel the water on your hands, scrub every part. Be clean. Focus on what you are doing. Often, the successful mediocre people should strive for excellence in zero-tasking. Do nothing. We always feel like we have to be doing something or we (or, I should say I) feel ashamed. Sometimes its better to just be quietto not think of anything at all. Out of silence comes the greatest creativity, not when we are rushing and panicking.FAILURE  As far as I can tell, Larry Page has never failed. He went straight from graduate school to billions. Ditto for Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and a few others. But again, by definition, most of us are pretty mediocre. We can strive for greatness but we will never hit it. So it means we will often fail. Not always fail. But often.My last 16 out of 17 business attempts were failures. I made so many mistakes in my first successful business Im almost embarassed to recount them. I remember one time I was trying to pitch Tupacs mom that I should do the website for her dead son. I had a CD (whats that?) of all my work. I went to Tupacs managers office and he said, ok, show me what you got.\" The only problem was: I had never used a Windows-based machineonly Macs and Unix machines. So I honestly had no idea how to put my CD into the computer and then view its contents. And I had gone to graduate school in computer science. He said, \"you have got to be kidding me.\"It was a $90,000 gig. It wouldve met my payroll for at least two months. It was a done deal until I walked into his office. I left his office crying while he was laughing. When I came back to my office everyone asked, How did the meeting go? I said, I think it went pretty well. And then I went home and cried some more. I roll that way. Then I bought a Windows-based PC for myself and learned how to use it. I dont think I ever bought a Mac again actually. Its possible to learn from successes, but its much easier to learn from failures.Ultimately, life is a sentence of failures, punctuated only by the briefest of successes. So the mediocre person learns two things from failure: First, he learns directly how to overcome that particular failure. Hes highly motivated to not repeat the same mistakes. Second, he learns how to deal with the psychology of failure. Mediocre entrepreneurs fail a lot. So they get this incredible skill of getting really good at dealing with failure. This translates to monetary success. The mediocre entrepreneur understands that persistence is not the self-help cliche, Keep going until you hit the finish line! The key slogan is, Keep failing until you accidentally no longer fail. Thats persistence.UNORIGINAL IDEASIve never come up with an original idea in my life. My first successful business was making web software, strategies, and websites for Fortune 500 companies. Not an original idea but at the time, in the 90s, people were paying exorbitant multiples for such businesses. My successful investments all involved situations where I made sure the CEOs and other investors were smarter than me. I wrote a TechCrunch article on this titled \"My Angel Investor Checklist.\" 100% of my zeros as an angel investor were situations where I thought I was smart. I wasnt. Im mediocre.The best ideas are when you take two older ideas that have nothing to do with each other, make them have sex with each other, and then build a business around the bastard, ugly child that results. The child that was so ugly nobody else wanted to touch it. Look at Facebook: combine the internet with stalking. Amazing! And, by the way, it was about the fifth attempt at such a social network. Twitter: combine internet with antiquated SMS protocols. Ugly! But it works. Ebay, combine ecommerce with auctions. The song, \"Ill Be There.\" Combine Mariah Carey with Michael Jackson. If Justin Bieber sang John Lennons \"Imagine\" it would be a huge hit. I might even listen to it.POOR NETWORKINGIm that guy. You know, the one at the party that doesnt talk to anyone and stands in the corner. I never go to tech meetups. I usually say no to very nice networking dinner invitations. I like to stay home and read. When I was running businesses I was often too shy to talk to my employees. I would call my secretary from downstairs and ask if the hallway was clear, then ask her to unlock my door and Id hurry upstairs and lock the door behind me. That particular company failed disastrously.But many people network too much. Entrepreneurship is hard enough. Its 20 hours a day of managing employees, customers, meetings, and product development. And the buck stops here sort of thing. And then what are you going to do? Network all night? Save that for the great entrepreneurs. Or the ones who are about to fail. The mediocre person works his 20 hours, then relaxes when he can. Its tough to make money. Not a party.DO ANYTHING TO GET A \"YES\"Heres a negotiation I did: I was starting StockPickr.com and meeting with the CEO of TheStreet.com. He wanted his company to have a percentage of StockPickr and in exchange he would fill up all of our ad inventory. I was excited to do the deal. I said, Ok, I was thinking you would get 10% of the company. He laughed and said, No. 50%.\" He didnt even say We would like 50%.\" He just said, 50%.\" I then used all my negotiating skills and came up with a reply: Okay. Deal. Im a salesman. I like people to say yes to me. I feel insecure when they so No or, even worse, if they dont like me. When I started a company doing websites we were pitching to do Miramax.com. I said, $50,000.\" They said, No more than $1,000 and thats a stretch. I used my usual technique: Deal!But the end results: in one case TheStreet had a significant stake so that gave them more psychological stake. And for my first business Miramax was now on my client list. So Con Edison had to pay a lot more. Im a mediocre salesman and probably a poor negotiator although I try to learn from the best. But consequently, I get more deals done, I get the occasional loss leader, and then ultimately the big fish gets reeled in if I get enough people to say yes.\"JUDGE PEOPLE POORLYThe mediocre entrepreneur doesnt Blink in the Malcolm Gladwell sense. In Gladwells book he often talks about people who can form snap correct judgements in two or three seconds. My initial judgement when I meet or even see people is this: I hate you. And then I veer from that to too trusting. Finally, after I bounce back and forth, and through much trial and error, I end up somewhere in the middle. I also tend to drop people I cant trust very quickly. I think the great entrepreneur can make snap judgements and be very successful with it. But that doesnt work for most people.At this point, when I meet someone, I make sure I specifically dont trust my first instincts. I get to know people more. I get to understand what their motivations are. I try to sympathize with whatever their position is. I listen to them. I try not to argue or gossip about them before I know anything. I spend a lot more time getting to know the people who I want to bring closer. I have to do this because Im mediocre and Im a lot more at risk of bringing the wrong people into my circle.So by the time Ive decided to be close to someone: a client, an employee, an acquirer, an acquiree, a wife, etc Ive done a lot of work into thinking about them. This means I cant waste time thinking about other things, like how to put a rocketship on Jupiter. But overall its worked.I thought being mediocre is supposed to be bad? one might think. Shouldnt we strive for greatness. And the answer is: Of course we should! But lets not forget that 9 out of 10 drivers think they are above the median in driving skill. People overestimate themselves. Dont let overestimation get in the way of becoming fabulously rich, or at least successful enough that you can have your freedom, feed your family, and enjoy other things in life.Being mediocre doesnt mean you wont change the world. It means being honest with yourself and the people around you. And being honest at every level is really the most effective habit of all if you want to have massive success.]',\n",
       "  147: '[I got an email at 5 in the morning that made me angry. It pressed every button. It accused. It threatened. It cc-ed people. It attempted to make me feel guilt. It attempted to make me feel fear. I can go on.I started to type a response and then I stopped. Im not so great that I can always stop. Sometimes I respond. Sometimes hellfire breaks loose from the carefully constructed dams.But Im trying to get better. We find our strength deep in the valley of our fears.Sometimes the best thing to do is: nothing.Many productivity books tell you what you can do MORE of in order to achieve goals, purpose, success money, etc. But MORE is hard to do. Im already busy. Now you tell me I have to make a to-do list with six things that make me feel grateful on top of it? I cant do it all. You need to eliminate first. You need to be a productivity minimalist in order to be a success. The key is to find the easy things you can chop off where you can at the very least do nothing instead of doing things that actually DAMAGE your productivity. Heres a checklist I use for when to do nothing:Do nothing when youre angry. Some people think anger can focus emotions, but it doesnt. Its like focusing on a kaleidoscope. Youll walk straight off a cliff. Anger is a roadmap off that cliff. You have to wait until it settles down and you get perspective. Time is the morphine drip that soothes the anger. Then you can act. Anger is just an outer reflection of inner fear. The fear might be correct, but the anger blurs it.Do nothing when youre paranoid. I initially wrote fear here. But fear can focus. If youre in the jungle and theres a lion on your right and an apple tree on your left then you better run as fast as you can back where you came from. But often Im not afraid, Im paranoid. I imagine a chaotic future filled with misery and hate and homelessness and loneliness. My best bet is to sit down and picture a more realistic future, one based on the fact that almost 99 percent of what Ive been paranoid about in the past never comes true.Do nothing when youre anxious. Why did they call at 5 p.m. on a Friday night and say, We HAVE to talk. Well, I guess youre not there. Talk Monday? Ugh! I hate that! Why 5 p.m.? What did they have to say? I should call her house line. I should write. I should drive up and visit (Hey, just stopping by! So, uhh, what was up with that phone call?). There is nothing that is ever so important it cant wait. And if it was that important, then its a roadmap to you and not the situation. Its an opportunity to say, What about my life can be rearranged so that this one thing doesnt throw me off so much? What things can I change? And then have fun changing them.Do nothing when youre tired. I was trying to figure out something on the computer the other day. It was both very technical and related to money. First it was 1 p.m. Then it was 6 p.m. Then, against all my rules for a daily practice, it was midnight. And I was no closer to figuring it out. I was tired. My eyes were blurry. I was taking ten-second naps on my computer. A week later I still havent figured out what I needed to figure out. But right then, because I had invested this time into my learning and I was tired, I wanted to keep going. My wife Claudia peeled me off the keyboard and marched me upstairs. Sleep hygiene is the best way to improve productivity in your life. Not beating your head against a computer.Do nothing when you want to be liked. How many times have I gone to a meeting? Taken a trip abroad? Made stupid investments? Written an article? Done did doing does? Just so someone would like me: a mother, a father, a friend, a reader, an investor, a customer, a stranger. Answer: a lot of times. Too many times. And it works. I put in the input (flattery, attention, false love) and get out the output (false love back). And continue to live the illusion in search of the dream, in avoidance of the nightmare, ignorant of the reality. Do I make any money this way? Do I feel a sense of accomplishment? In my 25 years of business: Never.***Thats my checklist. If I feel any of these conditions occurring  like a sniffle in the night that turns into a flu by morning  then I stop. What do I do when I stop? I do nothing. I read a book. I write. I watercolor. I take a walk. I sit and do absolutely nothing.Think about when youve been happiest with your life (and if thats not a reasonable goal then what is?). Is it during those moments when your thoughts have been frenetic and all over the place? Or has it been those moments when your thoughts have been calm  the depths of a peaceful ocean instead of a stormy surface. Its when we are in touch with the magic of our silence that we find our inner creators and can change the universe.]',\n",
       "  148: \"[Ive never read a book on sales. They seemed corny. Like many people, I always looked down on the concept of selling. It seemed like something lower than me.To some extent, selling appears manipulative. You have a product where you give the perception it has more value than it has in reality. So you need to manipulate people to buy it. This seems sad, as in Death of a Salesman sort of sad.I was a salesman snob.I was wrong. And for the past 25 years all I have been doing is selling. Selling products, selling services, selling businesses, selling myself.Sometimes I have been manipulative. And sometimes Ive sold things Ive had such passion for I sold it cheap just because I wanted the message out about what I was selling.And often, it was very much in the middle: I needed to sell something because I had to pay my bills. Maybe I was a little desperate, a little hopeful, a little scared, and I wanted to make sure my family got fed.We live in a hard world where our basic needs cost money, and as we get older we become responsible for the basic needs of others. We become adults.Adults sell for today. Professionals sell for life.So here are the rules of this cheat sheet: None of this comes from a book. All of this is from my own experience. Which means it might not work for you. Which means it might go counter to the basic rules of salesmanship. I have no idea.I downloaded a book by Og Mandino and by Zig Ziglar but I didnt read them. Maybe I should.But I can say that over the past 25 years Ive sold hundreds of millions of dollars of stuff. That stuff being everything in Pandoras box that I had to sell just to stay alive. When I think what worked for me, heres what I come up with:A) FriendshipNobody is going to buy from someone they hate. The buyer has to like you and want to be your friend. People pay for friendship.This sounds sort of whoreish, and it is. The times when Ive hated myself the most were the times when Ive prostituted myself to make money (this isnt as sexual as it sounds but it might as well be).One time when I was raising money for something, the buyer was going through a business catastrophe and was worried he would go out of business. I didnt like him but I called him every day for three months at the same time to see if he wanted to talk and to offer my advice on how he should deal with his situation.I eventually raised a lot of money from him even though the first time I met him he was honest with me and said, it seems like you dont know your industry very well.Which just goes to show: friendship outweighs almost every other factor in selling. One time I wanted to do a website for ABC.com. How did I do it? The main decision maker was involved with a school in Harlem for charity. I went up there for four weeks in a row and played 20 kids simultaneously in chess. Everyone had fun. I got the website job. My competitors were all bigger, better financed, and probably better.Unfortunately, I didnt like either of those people personally. And eventually, I lost the business.The only good outcomes come when both sides like each other.At one point I was so sick of my new friendships I went to see a therapist with the clichd line, I dont even know who I am anymore because I hate all my friends and all my friends are customers so Im their slave friend.Now I only do business with people I like. The fastest way to lose all your money, mutilate your heart, and then kill yourself is to work with people you dont like. I will never do that again.Nor do you have to, despite what you might think.B) Saying NoIf someone wants to do a big deal with you its hard to say no. But No is valuable for many reasons:Opportunity cost. Instead of pursuing something you really dont want to do, you could free up time and energy to find something more lucrative or something you would enjoy more. Opportunity cost is the one BIGGEST cost in all of our lives. We spend it like theres no tomorrow.And guess what? Eventually theres no tomorrow.Supply and demand. If you reduce the supply of you (through No) then the demand for you goes up and you make more money (and have more fun).Youll hate yourself. I see this every day, particularly in my own life. The reason I can write about this is not because Im an expert. We dont write about the things we KNOW. We right about the things that are deep down CHALLENGES for us right now. When I say yes to something I dont want to do, I end up hating myself, hating the person I said yes to, doing a bad job, and disappointing everyone. I try try try not to do it anymore.(from Palookaville, by Seth)C) Over-DeliverIf someone pays $100 and you give them just $100 in value then you just failed. F.A.I.L.E.D.Youll never sell to that person again. Thats fine in some situations, but in most situations its no good. If someone pays $100, you need to give them $110 worth of value.Think of that extra $10 as going into some sort of karmic bank account that pays interest (as opposed to a U.S. bank account). That money grows and compounds. Eventually, theres real wealth there. And that wealth translates into wealth in the real world.People are three-year-olds. They like to get presents.People want to do business with people who give them presents. Over-delivering is a present. And it makes you feel good. Give and you will receive.D) Never Take No For An AnswerThis statement, which everyone knows, is usually applied incorrectly.People think it means, keep pushing and trying new things until you get a yes. Thats not what it means. If you do that, you end up in the spam box. Then you end up in the coffin box. In other words, you end up dead to the person you are trying to sell to.Instead, remember point A. Be a friend. However flimsy that connection of friendship is. Follow on Twitter, follow on Facebook. Say nice things about the person to other people. Never gossip.Do the art of the check in.Send updates after the No on how you are doing, on how the product or service or business or whatever is doing. Not every day. Maybe once a month. Maybe once a year. Who knows. Eventually you will find the yes with that person. It could be, and often is, up to 20 years later.Who knows? You plant a seed and eventually the garden blooms.E) Under-price (when its your passion so its easier to over-deliver)I once wanted to do the website for Fine Line Films. I loved their movies. I met the guy running their site. He kept saying over and over again, we cant afford a lot and I kept saying, dont worry about it and would show him more and more of our work.Eventually we did the websites for every one of their movies. $1,000 per website. We made amazing websites for $1,000. Then, when Con Edison wanted to hire us, Nevin at Fine Line was a reference. Price for coned.com (a basic four-page website): $250,000. And that was the first of five websites we did for them plus monthly maintenance.I write for a lot of places right now for free. Any medium I love, I am willing to write for. Its like a dream come true for me. The benefits from doing that have been incalculable. Not always financial, but always real.We are a combination of many constituencies inside of our bodies and minds. Financial is just one. But all of our constituencies need to work together to make us well-balanced and peaceful.The art of selling, for me, is to have everything inside of me working together.F) Be The SourceOne time I wanted to buy a company. The details of how I would do that are sort of obscure and not important. The company is well-known in the financial media space.At the critical moment, the owner called me and said, what should I do? I have this other offer and I have your offer. He described the other offer to me. I told him to take it.I missed out on what could have been a lot of money to me. But there was a slight chance we would have all gone bust. Now he is thriving and eight years later he is a friend.Will we ever do business together? I cant predict the future. But I know I delivered value to another human being. That value is real and I can put it to use whenever I want.Often the best way to make friends and customers for life is to direct them to a better service or product than yours.Be the source of valuable information rather than the source of your product-of-the-day. Then they will know forever that you are a trusted source.Trust is worth more than next months rent being paid. Trust builds a bridge that will never wear out. At some point in the distant future, when you are on the run in every other way, you may need to cross that bridge.G) Sell EverythingYour offering is not your product. Your offering is product, services, your employees, your experiences, your ideas, your other customers, and even (as mentioned above) your competitors. Sell them all.When you are good at what you do, the product or service you offer is just the way people build the first link to you. Its the top of a huge pyramid.But the base of the pyramid, the real service, is when they have access to you and you can provide advice and the full power of your network and experience. This is when you are over-delivering on steroids and how real wealth is built and not just a one-time fee for a service or product.Many people say, no! My product is high margin and I want to make money when I sleep.Stop going to BS entrepreneur, get-rich conferences. In the long run nobody cares about your product. In the long run, it is the entire holistic view of your offering, your service, you, that you are selling. Without that, you will build a mediocre business that may or may not pay the bills. With that, you will create wealth.H) Sell The DreamPeople can see what your product is right now. What they want to know isthe future. Will your product make them more money? Will it get them a promotion? Maybe even: will YOU hire them if they buy your product.Everything is possible. When you get in the door, do not sell your product. People make a decision on your product in five seconds. Sell the dream. The dream has up to infinity in value. Build up images of the dream. Give a taste of what the dream is like. Let it linger. Let it weave itself. Let the imagination of the buyer take hold and run with it.But then, you might ask, do I risk under-delivering.Answer: Yes. Dont do that. Be as good as the dream.I) Fire CustomersThis is similar to point B with the one difference that you have already made a sale.If its not going well or if its leaving a bad taste somewhere inside of you, or if they have gone from friend to enemy for whatever reason and it seems like there is no repair, then fire your customer. The sooner the better.This applies to not just customers but everyone in your life. EVERYONE.If someone no longer has your best interest at heart, then in your own self-interest you need to back off. NOW.A bad customer (a bad person) spreads like a disease inside you, your employees, your other customers, your competitors, your future customers, your family, etc.But what if its my biggest customer? How do I pay the bills?I dont know. Figure it out. You have to or you will die.When I tell people to build their idea muscle (by writing down 10 ideas, good or bad, every day) its not so they can come up with great business ideas (although they might).Its so they can come up with ideas in situations like this. This is where being an idea machine saves your life and saves everything around you.But remember: bad customers will kill you and your family and your friends.J) Welcome To The Pleasure DomeYour best new customers are your old customers. If you need to make more money or build new business then go to your customers (who are now your friends) and ask them, I need advice. What other service can I provide you or anyone you know.It might be something totally unrelated to your business. No problem. Do it. It might be your customer is looking for a new job. Thats great. Make it your business to find him a new job. Now you have a new customer.It might be your customer needs a boyfriend. Ok, introduce her to all of your friends who might be good for her. If youve been following this approach to sales then your customers are now your friends, are now your family, are now the lifeblood of how you wake up in the morning.* * *We spend years building a garden. We plant the seeds. We tend the soil. We water the plants.But we are also the sun. The sun shines no matter what. It doesnt care which flower blossoms. The sun is always there providing value every second of the day.Be the sun and you will become abundance.I don't know the buzzwords to make a sale. I'm not very good at shaking hands. I don't take people out to baseball games or do any of the things I see other people do.But Ive been selling for 25 years. And whenever Ive been dead broke, depressed, and suicidal, Ive picked myself up and sold again and again.I am a salesman.]\",\n",
       "  149: \"[I was the worst pizza delivery guy. Fraternity guys would chase after me as I was peeling out of their driveways after a delivery. Why? The sauce and cheese fell all to one side. I couldnt help it. I also never got tips. Wende, my partner in our restaurant delivery business, always got tips. But she was beautiful, blonde, great smile, had personality, etc. And I secretly loved her. I couldnt compete. We also started a debit card for college kids. From the first day we were open for business we had college kids signing up for our card (there were no credit cards for kids then). And anyone who had our debit card could order food from the 20 or so restaurants in town and wed deliver, but with a 25% markup.I loved delivering food because it gave me twenty, or even forty minute breaks from my girlfriend. We were having troubles at the time. Id sometimes stop the car between deliveries and just read. I was a screwed up 19 year old then. Now Im only a mildly-screwed up 46 year old.Ive had seven startups since then. And some profitable exits. And another 20 or so that Ive funded.When I think entrepreneur I think Mark Cuban or Larry Page or Steve Jobs. I dont usually think of myself. In part because I feel shame that after all of these startups I dont have a billion dollars. Many startups fail. But Ive had a few successes as well. Successes in a startup makes you feel immortal.I was going to make this post: the 12 rules to being a good entrepreneur and I outlined the 12 rules that have consistently worked for me. But rule #1 is taking up 1500 words already. So this one rule is going to take up the whole post. But, for me, this is the most important rule.The MOST IMPORTANT RULE: Have a customer before you start your business. This is a corollary of the phrase, ideas are a dime a dozen.There is another corollary: lazy is best. If you have to work for two years before one dollar of revenue comes into business then thats too much work. Im lazy so I like money coming in with as little work as possible. Mark Zuckerberg, of course, is different. He put in years of work before dollar one of revenue came in. But were different people. In about twenty minutes Im going to go to the local caf here, The Foundry, and bring a pad, order a coffee and muffin, and write down ideas for businesses. Then Ill probably throw the piece of paper out. Because ideas are useless. They are just practice to keep your idea muscle in shape.FAKE RULE: People say, Execution is important. Thats not really true either. Execution is useless. Its a commodity. The only thing thats important is money. You get money by having a customer. You get a customer by satisfying a need thats so important to them they would be willing to pay for it. If you have a customer thats willing to pay you money, then execution becomes a lot easier. Life as an entrepreneur is hard. Why make it harder for yourself?I like stability as much as I like taking risks. So for me, I need a customer. Its a matter of how much risk you want to take. I tell people to quit their jobs and jump into the abyss. If a customer happens to be waiting for you in the abyss then you wont be lonely there. Loneliness is bad for a startup.Example: How Stockpickr StartedTom Clarke, the CEO of thestreet.com called me up in mid 2006. He wanted to meet and brainstorm ideas with me. So I had about two weeks to prepare. I called up a development firm in India. MySpace had just been acquired by NewsCorp so I sketched out what I considered the MySpace of Finance. I threw in every idea from my own trading.In other words, I wanted to create a site that I would use as a professional trader and so I knew other traders would benefit from it. And, I had a theory about making a quality financial site that basically had no news in it. Im going to be blunt: 99% of financial news is useless and misinformed and misleading, if not outright lying. My ideas for the site were purely based on my own ten years experience as a professional trader. In fact, I had just turned down working for a multi-billion dollar hedge fund based on a specific strategy I had. Instead, I implemented that strategy within stockpickr.com.Within a week, for free (because I told the company in India that I would be building the site with them if they sent back good screenshots, which was true), the company sent me back screenshots. I met with Tom and told him, Im almost done with the site. Here it is. (I exaggerated) And I showed him the screenshots. I had set up meetings with Yahoo and AOL as well to discuss them so it wasnt a stretch to say, Im also talking to Yahoo and AOL. Nobody wants to be the first customer, so you have to create the aura of many customers.And so he said, why are you talking with them? Youve been with us forever. Lets do this together. So we negotiated right there. I said, great, how about you guys take 10% of the company and put all your extra ads on all of our pages and let me link from every article back to Stockpickr.com (the name of the company).He said, I thought we were partners. Lets do it 50-50. So right away, I had given up 50% of the company. Most people I spoke to thought this was a horrible idea. In fact, one of my employees quit because I did this: but giving 50% of your company away is often better than giving 10% of your company away. When you give 50% of the company away, your partner is obligated to follow through and be a real partner. He can never forget about you. Its also always a good thing when the most popular person in financial media, Jim Cramer, was also a 50% partner in my business since he was the founder of thestreet.com. If you can get the top person in your field to take equity, youre golden from day one. Again, its all about making life easy. With family responsibilities, health, life in general, why make things even harder for yourself?It's like that saying when you owe the bank a million, they own you. When you owe the bank a billion, you own them. Three years later I watched another company thestreet.com only took 10% of almost disappear because Thestreet.com was not obligated to follow through.So, at that point, without even having a site finished (or even started): I knew I had three things going for me:A) I was going to get traffic. I could write three or four articles a day and link each one back to stockpickr all over the article. The street.com got 100mm pageviews a month so I knew I would get some percentage of that.B) I was going to make money. If I got even 3 million pageviews a month and the average CPM of thestreet.com (according to their SEC filings) was $17, I would make about $50 thousand a month with expenses nearing zero. What if I put 3 ads a page on the site? Then I would make even more. Slap a 40x multiple on a growing company and before I even started I had real value.C) Profitability and growth from day one meant I could put the company up for sale almost immediately. But thats another story.With my first successful company, Reset, I had about 10 paying customers before I finally made the jump to running the company fulltime: HBO, Interscope, BMG, New Line Cinema, and Warner Brothers were all paying customers before I jumped ship from HBO to run Reset fulltime.(the Wu-Tang Clan was a paying customer)When I started my fund of hedge funds I didnt put one dime into the expense of setting it up until I had the first $20 million commitment. $20 million with a 1.5% management fee meant an instant $300 thousand in revenues, plus extra money for legal fees, etc. Enough to pay a salary or two. It took a year of cultivating my network before I had that commitment, but it worked.This is just me, personally. Some people dont mind starting a company without any customers. Im too conservative for this. Im happy to even give up equity to get that first customer. 50% of a profitable company is better than 100% of a company that will probably quickly go out of business.How do you get that first customer?\\nWho? List the 20 CEOs or high level executives you would like to meet. If you have a rolodex, great. If you dont, then you might have to write to 40 people. This is why its important to Exploit your Employer and use some of the other ideas mentioned throughout this blog. But its ok if your rolodex is cold. Many successful businesses Ive been involved with started with cold emails.\\nIdeas. Develop 20 ideas for each person. Get your idea muscle in shape first.\\nCommunicate. Write them all, giving at least 10 of the ideas, in detail, and how you would implement them. Sometimes you have to dig for their email address. Like I did here.\\nMeet. All this does is get you the meeting. Once youre in the door, the conversation can go anywhere. Of the 20 people you write, rule of the universe is youll get six meetings.\\nAsk. In the meetings ask the question, what one product can I build for you that you will definitely buy? Remember, execution is a commodity. Because of globalization you can build anything for cheap. I built the first working version of Stockpickr.com for $3000 in Bangalore. Throw in another $150 from a design made in Siberia. You need zero skillset for that. Just a good idea muscle, an ability to sell, and modest ability to manage a project.\\nNever say No. Never. If someone says, can you do this? Yes. But can you do this? Yes. Can you do it for this? Yes.\\nFollow up every day. Nice to meet you. Heres my sketch of what you want. Is this right? Should I start today?\\nEquity. If necessary, give up equity for that first customer. Or first two customers.\\nDone. If more than one CEO wants the same product or service, and the price is right, then now you have a business. Build the product, sell it, and youre in shape.\\nRepeat. Youre not really Done. Every day you have to go back and see if your customer is achieving more success BECAUSE of your products. If he is, then ask him what else he needs and then build it. If he isnt, then ask him what else he needs and builds it. Your easiest new sales will be with your old customers.\\nThis has worked for me on three different occasions. And each time resulted in great profits for me. By the way, this technique has also worked for people who have contacted me with their own ideas.Listen. Youve been hypnotized. Youve been told you need a corporate job. You need a college degree. You need stability. You need the white picket fence. You need the IRA and the health insurance. Snap your fingers in front of your face. The American Religion is a myth, just like the movie, Thor, is based on a myth. Stability is only in your mind. Theres $15 trillion dollars in our economy, recession or no recession. Its falling like snow. Reach out with your tongue and taste it.]\",\n",
       "  150: '[My site, Stockpickr.com, had 24 hours before it was going to go out of business and then I would probably have to kill myself. I had passed the 2 year point on a life insurance policy where it was now ok to kill myself so that my kids would still get the $4 million in the policy. It was Martin Luther King Day, 2007. He had a dream.My site was anti-news. And I write for all the news sites. Get rid of me if you want. But you know you scare and panic people until they wake up with stomach pains at 4 in the morning. Just so you could sell another $1.25 with the next nightmare headline. And then you dump them and move onto the next panic.So I made a finance site with everything but news. The only one. And thestreet.com had just announced it, and Jim Cramer was mentioning it every day on TV. And I knew that once Martin Luther King Day passed, I was going to go out of business.Because you get what you pay for and I had reached across the planet to hire Indian programmers to program my site. And everytime Jim Cramer mentioned the website on TV we crashed. We couldnt handle the load. It wasnt rocket science. Im a computer programmer. I shouldve just done it myself. But I hired a bunch of Jainists in Bangalore instead. One day they had a religious holiday. The other day the power went out so nobody was at work.. And finally I get ahold of them at 3 in the morning on Saturday night.Please. Please please, I said to Arvind, you have to fix this problem by Monday because Tuesday Cramers going to mention the site again and if we go down were out of business. You cant have a site go down anymore else people dont trust it.We will fix it, they said, dont worry. And I waited. All Sunday morning I kept hitting reload. It was slow. I knew it wasnt fixed. Dont worry, James. You worry too much, Arvind said, we will fix it. I called up ten friends and wed click simultaneously and the site will go down. Were testing stuff, the Indians said, it might go down but we know what the problem is. Were fixing it.Monday morning I woke up. I had a letter from Arvind in India. In Bangalore. Ive since been to Bangalore. At three in the morning their time, driving from Bangalore to Mysore. When are we going to get on the highway I kept wondering. Everywhere you went seemed like a side street. And random men and women walking along the side all night long. Men peeing on the side of the road. And little carts where the men would hang around drinking whatever. The cab driver had to stop and disappear for awhile and I stood outside thinking, here I am. I could just disappear and nobody would know, nobody would find me.But that was years later.Monday morning. 2007. Martin Luther King day. Letter from Arvind: Im sorry, James. But we have to give up. Its late here and we could not figure out the problem. Im really sorry but we have no idea what the problem is.And I had 24 hours approximately before I was sure I was out of business. When you are running a business, every detail counts. Your customers are not forgiving. Your competitors laugh in your face. Your benefactors deny they ever knew you. Your programmers move on to their next project and remove your name from their client list.Your friends say, well maybe your next business. Your children want to play, not knowing that their lives, too, hang in the balance. But they dont really care because ultimately they move on and leave their parents behind, move on to exciting new lives as artists, lovers, professional whatevers, saying, I had a father once.So at 7am I made the call. I called Chet. Super Chet. I hadnt spoken to him in at least eight years. His phone number was listed in Boston so I called him. He was the single best programmer on the planet. And he was born in India although raised in Texas.Ill give you one example. When IBM was hosting the live streaming Olympics in 1996 on the web their servers kept going down. Who did they call? Not their 10,000 person IT department. They called Chet in his apartment in the Upper West Side. He took his little computer and wrote some sort of networking protocol between his computer and 20 other IBM mainframes around the world. The Olympics was saved. IBM was saved.Chet lived wherever he wanted. He worked on whatever he wanted. IBM didnt want him to ever leave so they agreed to everything he ever asked for. He put out fires for them. Thats what he still does to this day.We had worked together in 1988. But thats another story. In 1996 he would hang out at my first company and do all the spare programming we needed on the weekends. For free. He just liked doing it. That was his weekend fun.One time in 1996 he called me while I was out on the town and he was programming. James! Why did you write the code this way? Its like spaghetti. You took up 10 pages of code when just a few lines wouldve done it.Chet, I asked him. Is the client standing right there next to you?Yes, he said.THEN SHUT THE FUCK UP!Ahh, he said, got it! And he hung up the phone.Martin Luther King day: 2007, 6am. I call Chet for the first time since 1999. Chet, its James. James? Look, no time to update. I hope all is well but I need your help badly.I explained the whole problem to him in about three minutes. I think I was crying.Ok, ok, ok, he said, and he asked a couple of technical questions about how the site was built. I answered the best I could.Ok, he said, heres the problem: I have a plane to catch to Paris at around 4pm so I really only have until 2pm. Im giving a talk there and I cant skip it. But give me the phone number of the Indians and give me access to all the servers. I gave him all of the passwords.I cant do this from home. Im going to do this from the office. Ill call you in twenty minutes.PLEASE FUCKING FIX THIS! I said, THEYRE FROM INDIA. JUST LIKE YOU! YOU CAN DEAL WITH THEM! Im not pretty in a panic.Ok, ok, James. You have. To calm. Down. he said, give me twenty minutes to get dressed and get into the office. It was 6am and he had a plane to Paris to catch.By noon that day he had spoken to the Indians, he had rewritten half the code, he gave them detailed instructions about what they had been doing wrong, he advised me on how to keep calm in moments like this and what I should be looking to do long-term to fix the site. He did all of this even though the site was written in a programming language he had never used before. On the way to the office he somehow learned the programming language.By noon that day the problem was fixed. The site never crashed again.By 4pm he was on a flight to Paris. When he got there I called him. Chet, I cant thank you enough. I want to give you a piece of the company. You deserve it.No way, James, he said, remember in 1995 when we were on the 42 Street subway platform underneath Times Square?No, I said.I was going on and on about distributed objects, blah blah and you said, Chet! Shut up with that. Its boring. You should be doing the Internet and nothing else. Thats what is going to make your career. I dont remember, I said.Well that conversation changed my life. I switched everything to the Internet. You were right! And its changed my life ever since.I didnt know what to say. Maybe I vaguely remembered. He continued:Consider the favor returned.]',\n",
       "  151: \"[I needed to make one hundred million dollars pretty fast. You know how it is. There are bills to pay. There are things you want to do in life. I wanted, for instance, to work as a cashier in a bookstore. But with a twist. I would own the bookstore. I wanted to do a 90 second ad in the SuperBowl which would just be me walking around for 90 seconds saying and doing nothing. People would argue afterwards, he couldve used that money for charity. How selfish! But I wouldnt care. It was my money and I could do what I want with it. I would be teaching this grand lesson to all the people watching the Superbowl. I had no other specific desires about what I would do with one hundred million dollars. Just those two. But I knew more things would come.At the time (1999) I had recently made money selling a company in the web services business. Among other things, my company made the website for the movie, The Matrix. I knew I was Neo but I wouldnt be able to take the red pill until I had my first hundred million. That was the pill that would let me be a real person. The pill that would allow me to be fully alive.So I came up with an idea. It was a catchphrase and I would use it many times over the next six months. First there was the wireLINE internet. Then there was the wireLESS internet. Which would be ten times bigger.Those three sentences (or maybe its one if you use commas) were my path to $100 million. Heres what you do then once you have your catchphrase. I had a business partner who wasnt shy. So he called up 20 companies in the wireless software business and said, We want to buy your company. We had no money to buy anybody but if you ever let that slow you down you might as well run around naked in a football stadium with 60,000 people watching you.One company responded. A company called MobileLogic out of Denver. They flew in and we took them out to breakfast at the Royalton Hotel on 44th Street. Its a fancy breakfast place. The sort of place Rupert Murdoch orders the pancakes, chews it up, spits it out without swallowing, and then orders granola to be healthy.Were all sitting around a table. Its fortunate that you called, the CEO of MobileLogic said to us. Since Ericsson just offered us seventeen million and were thinking of taking it. Why would you take that, I said. Well offer you twenty million, half cash, half stock. That stock alone will be worth one hundred million or more once we go public. We have five other companies well buy after you. Youll be President of a major company thats going public, pronto. Ericsson is the old generation. Be apart of something new and exciting.I love the pancakes at the Royalton. They whip the eggs into the batter. Its fluffy and delicious. And the bacon is thick and the bacon juices spill into your mouth as you bite into it. Life was good. Jerry Levin might very well have been at the table next to us buying AOL right in front of our eyes. That's how good life was then.They took our offer. We quickly wrote up a binding LOI which they signed. We negotiated their salaries, their options, their earnout, everything. Now we needed to pay them twenty million dollars. We knew we could pay half the twenty in stock. So that was easy. That was a piece of paper. Now we had to come up with the other ten.No problem. Because suddenly I had a real asset. I had a binding LOI for a company with $5-10mm in revenues (despite my propensity to remember every detail of my childhood, I cant remember how much in revenues this company I was buying in 1999 had). There were companies going public then with zero dollars in revenues that were now worth over a hundred trillion dollars.So, with some partners who were excellent middlemen I started going to potential investors. Mark Patterson, who was then vice chairman of CSFB and is now the head of multi-billion dollar hedge fund Maitlin-Patterson set up a conference call with a few small investors. One call he set up was with Henry Kravis, Leo Hindery, Jim McMann (CEO of 1800-Flowers) and Dennis something or other who just sold a huge Irish telecom company and was worth a random billion or so. I gave a fifteen minute talk. I described my background and the company I had sold. Then I used my catchphrase (see above) and scoped out the opportunity (10x the size of the wireline internet) and that was the call. Henry Kravis asked a question. I cant remember what it was now because all I kept thinking was you were the barbarian at the gate and now Im the barbarian.Right after the call, Mark Pattersons phone started ringing. Mark told me, Henry wants to wire five million right now. But we only took one from him. Too many other people wanted to invest. Everyone on that 15 minute conference call put in one million each.At another meeting to raise money, I had to describe what we did. I wasnt even totally sure what MobileLogic did. We protected data that was in corporate databases but was being sent out to the salesforces through wireless devices that we set up. It was pretty solid. I said, the data goes to the satellite and then comes down to our devices.I thought the data didnt go through satellites. Doesnt data go through cellular towers? someone named Mamoon asked.Uh-oh. That seemed to make more sense than satellites. Sometimes, I answered.And they put five million in. Frank Quattrone put money in. Sam Waksal, Allen &amp; Co. CMGI. The list goes on. We were the hot investment for three seconds. One guy who had initially rejected us but then saw the list of investors called me at two in the morning and said, please let me put in a million.So we closed on thirty million dollars and bought our first company. Then we bought a second company. A consulting company called Katahdin. They had nothing to do with wireless but they had profits. Wed bury them in the IPO story but make use of their profits. Then we bought a third company. I cant even remember their name but they were a spinoff from MIT. Right away we were getting calls. Aether Systems wanted to buy us but we said no. They only wanted to pay fifty million for the company. A banker at CS First Boston told us he could get us seventy five million no problem. But we didnt even listen to him. In the elevator we laughed at him. What an old fool! We were going for an IPO.Every bank came in with a powerpoint and a team of young people to pitch us. Goldman, CSFB, Merrill, Lehman, etc. CSFB was the front runner because Frank Quattrone was an investor but Merrill made a strong pitch. The pitch was funny. The top Merrill banker was there. He said to the associate on the deal, John, walk them through the numbers. And John said, uhh, my name is Roy. Two other things I remember from the pitch. The first was, Henry Blodget will be the analyst on this deal. He loves wireless. Which made no sense to me since he was an Internet consumer analyst.The other thing I remember was the back page of the presentation. The beautiful back page. The only page that mattered. It had what my networth would be if we IPOed and the market valued us similar to Aether Systems. I would be worth something like nine hundred million dollars.I knew exactly what bookstore I wanted to buy. It would be Shakespeare &amp; Company on Broadway. None of the other employees would know that I would be the owner. And I would work just stacking books and being the guy at the cash register. My secret would give me infinite power.I didnt know how to be CEO of this company. And because I didnt really know any of the employees of the companies we were buying I was feeling very shy. I would call my secretary before I arrived at work and ask her if anyone was in the hallway and could she please unlock my office door. Then I would hurry into the office and lock the door behind me.Eventually they replaced me as CEO. Even later, when we had to raise up to another 70 million, they asked me to step off as a director on the board. At one point I arranged for a reverse merger to occur. Wed be public at at least at a hundred million dollar valuation. But the guy behind the reverse merger turned out to have a checkered past and had spent some time in jail in 1969 for either embezzlement or something to do with transporting fake diamonds. But that's another story.None of this portrays me in a good light at all. Except for maybe the fact that I was a good salesman during the greatest bubble in world history. But it was decade ago and I dont mind what people think.But I did learn several things that became incredibly important to me later. :A) If you have to raise thirty million to start your business, its probably not a good business (at least for me). All of my good businesses (businesses that I started that I eventually sold and made money on) started off profitable from day one and never raised a dime of money.B) Most M&amp;A transactions dont work. When you buy a company, its very hard to keep the owners of the old company incentivized. 90% of acquisitions dont work. Build your business. Dont buy it.C) A lesson I learn repeatedly: traveling for business almost never generates more revenues. New York (and America) are big enough places to generate revenues. You should never travel. In the course of doing this business I traveled repeatedly to the west coast, Denver, England (to try and buy a company), Sweden (where Ericsson was based), Germany (Ericsson wanted me to show up at a conference for one day), Georgia, Florida, Boston, etc etc. Not a single meeting generated any revenues for the business but wasted hundreds of hours of my life.D) Hiring smart people doesnt work if you arent smart. Everything ultimately comes form the top down.E) Spending a lot of money on branding and marketing materials is a waste of money for a startup. If you dont know who you are, no amount of money will create materials explaining who you are.F) If you are going to raise thirty million for a business, then raise a hundred million if you can. Dont turn down Henry Kravis five million. It doesnt matter how badly you get diluted. If you have to raise money, take in every dime you can.G) MOST IMPORTANT: If you raise thirty million, spend none of it. Warren Buffett once said, if you know a business will be around 20 years from now then its probably a good investment. With thirty million we couldve stayed in business for 20 years or more and eventually figured ourselves out. Instead, I spent forty million in the first month or so. I learned a lot, and over a hundred million was lost.Eventually Vaultus (the name of the company. I think i forgot to mention it until now) was sold to Antenna Software. I made no money, as I rightfully shouldnt.Four years later, I was on a train to Boston with my business partner. It was 5 in the morning and we were going up to visit a hedge fund we were invested in. He was reading Bloomberg magazine. Holy shit, he said, waking me up. He showed me an article in the magazine. It was about Yasser Arafat, who had just died. Turns out he had a front corporation that was making various investments for him from the money he had somehow made off of the PLO. His largest (or second largest ) investment was two million dollars he had put into a New York company, Vaultus, Inc.. I can tell you for a fact his estate lost that two million.So, as they say in Brooklyn, it was good for the Jews.]\",\n",
       "  152: '[This is going be a bullet FAQ on starting a business. No joke. If youre a lawyer, feel free to disagree with me, so you can charge someone your BS fees to give the same advice. If you can think of anything to add, please do so. I might be missing things. If you want to argue with me, feel free. I might be wrong on any of the items below.There are many types of business. Depending on your business, some of these wont apply. All of these questions come from questions Ive been asked.The rules are: Im going to give no explanations. Just listen to me.1) C Corp or S Corp or LLC? C-Corp if you ever want to take on investors or sell to another company.2) What state should you incorporate in? Delaware.3) Should founders vest? Yes, over a period of four years. On any change of control the vesting speeds up.4) Should you go for venture capital money? First build a product, then get a customer, then get friends-and-family money (or money from revenues which is cheapest of all) and then think about raising money. But only then. Dont be an amateur.5) Should you patent your idea? Get customers first. Patent later. Dont talk to lawyers until the last possible moment.6) Should you require venture capitalists to sign NDAs? No. Nobody is going to steal your idea.7) How much equity should you give a partner? Divide things up into these categories: manage the company; raise the money; had the idea; brings in the revenues; built the product (or performs the services). Divide up in equal portions.8) Should you have a technical co-founder if you are not technical?

No. You get what you pay for.10) How do you market your app? Friends and then word of mouth.11) Should you build a product? Maybe. But first see if, manually, your product works. Then think about providing it as a service. Then productize the commonly used services. Too many people do this in reverse and then fail.12) How much dilution is too much dilution? If someone wants to give you money, then take it. The old saying, 100 percent of nothing is worth less than 1 percent of something.13) Do you listen to venture capitalist? Yes, of course. They gave you money. But then dont do anything they ask you to do.14) What if nobody seems to be buying your product? Then change to a service and do whatever anyone is willing to pay for using the skills you developed while making your product.\\nYoure gonna rattle the stars, you are.\\n15) If a client wants you to hire their friend or they wont give you the business (e.g. like a bribe) what should you do? Always do the ethical thing: Hire the friend and get the clients business.16) What do you do when a customer rejects you in a B2B business? Stay in touch once a month. Never be angry.17) In a B2C business? Release fast. Add new features every week.18) How do you get new clients? The best new clients are old clients. Always offer new services. Think every day of new services to offer old clients.19) Whats the best thing to do for a new client? Over-deliver for the first 100 days. Then you will never lose them.20) What if your client asks you to do something not in your business plan? Do it, or find someone who can do it, even if its a competitor.21) Should I ever focus on SEO? No.22) Should I do social media marketing? No.23) Should I ever talk badly about a partner of an employee even though they are awful? Never gossip. Always be straight with the culprit.24) I have lots of ideas. How do I pick the right one? Do as many ideas as possible. The right idea will pick you.25) What is the sign of an amateur?\\nAsking for an NDA.\\nTrying to raise VC money before product or customers.\\nHaving fights with partners in the first year. Fire them or split before anything gets out of control.\\nWorrying about dilution.\\nTrying to get Mark Cuban to invest because this would be great for the Dallas Mavericks.\\nAsking people you barely know to introduce you to Mark Cuban.\\nAsking people for five minutes of their time. Its never five minutes, so you are establishing yourself as a liar.\\nHaving a PowerPoint that doesnt show me arbitrage. I need to know that there is a small chance there is a 100x return on money.\\nCatch 22: showing people theres a small chance theres 100x return on their money. The secret of salesmanship is getting through the Catch 22.\\nRejecting a cash offer for your company when you have almost no revenues. Hello Friendster and Foursquare.\\n26) What is the sign of a professional?\\nGoing from bullshit product to services to product to SaaS product. (Corollary: the reverse is amateur hour).\\nCutting costs every day.\\nSelling every day, every minute.\\nWhen you have a billion in revenues, staying focused. When you have zero revenues, staying unfocused and coming up with new ideas every day.\\nSaying no to people who are obvious losers.\\nSaying yes to any meeting at all with someone who is an obvious winner.\\nKnowing how to distinguish between winners and losers (subject of an entire other post but in your gut you know  trust me).\\n27) When should I hire people full time? When you have revenues28) How long does it take to raise money? In a GREAT business, six months. In a mediocre business, infinity.29) Should I get an office? No, not unless you have revenues.30) Should I do market research? Yes, find one customer who DEFINITELY, without a doubt, will buy a service from you. Note that I dont say buy your product, because your initial product is always not what the customer wanted.31) Should I pay taxes? No. You should always reinvest your money and operate at a loss.32) Should I pay dividends? See above.33) What should the CEO salary be? No more than 2x your lowest employee if you are not profitable. This even assumes you are funded. If you are not funded your salary should be zero until your revenues can pay your salary last. Important RULE: the CEO salary is the last expense paid in every business.34) When should I fire employees? When you have fewer than six months burn in the bank and you arent getting revenues growing fast enough.35) When should you have sex with an employee? When you love her and the feeling is mutual.36) What other reasons should one fire an employee?\\nWhen they gossip.\\nWhen they dont over-deliver constantly.\\nWhen they ask for a raise because they think they are making below industry standard.\\nWhen they talk badly about a client.\\nWhen they have an attitude.\\n37) When should you give a raise? Rarely.38) How big should the employee option pool be? 15 to 20 percent.39) How much do advisers get? One-fourth of 1 percent. Advisers are useless. Dont even have an advisory board.40) How much do board members get? Nothing. They should all be investors. If they arent an investor, then one-half of 1 percent.41) What if one client is almost all of my revenues? Treat them very nicely. Dont forget the Christmas gift basket.42) Whats the best way to sell anything? Show arbitrage: If they pay X now they are buying something worth X * Y. That is the ONLY way to sell.43) What is the best way to sell anything? Part II: fear and agitation. Get them afraid (the world is falling apart). Get them agitated (this is the only way to stop it).44) Whats the best way to talk about your competition in a meeting? Use choice ambiguity (Google it). Say, all of my competition is great. I wouldnt even know how to choose among them.45) Whats the best way to value a company? Ask yourself (no BS): How much would it cost to recreate the technology, services, brand and customers you have already built. Then quadruple it and see what people would pay.46) Should I ever worry about the news or the economy? Absolutely not. The best businesses are started in horrible economies.47) What happened to all of my friends? You dont have anymore friends.48) How do I charge more for my services? Itemize as finely as possible and charge for each item.49) Do I charge per hour or per project or per month? First per project, then per-month maintenance.50) How do I prepare for a meeting? Know everything about the clients: competition, employees, industry. Over-read everything.\\nRead everything.\\n51) What is the only effective email marketing? Highly targeted email marketing written by professional copywriters, and the email list is made up of people who have bought similar services in the past six months.51a) Corollary: If you have zero skills as a copywriter then everything you write will be boring.52) Should I give stuff for free? Maybe. But dont expect free customers to turn into paying customers. Your free customers actually hate you and want everything from you for nothing, so you better have a different business model.53) Should I have schwag? No.54) Should I go to SXSW? No.55) Should I go to industry parties and meetups? No.56) Should I blog? Yes. You must. Blog about everything going wrong in your industry. Blog personal stories that you think will scare away customers. They wont. Customers will be attracted to honesty.57) Should I care about margins? No. Care about revenues.58) Should I spin-off this unrelated idea into a separate business? No. Make one business great. Throw everything in it. Do DBAs to identify different ideas.59) Should I hire people because I can travel on a seven-hour plane ride with them? Dont be an idiot. If anything, hire people the opposite of you. Or else who will you delegate to?60) When should I say no to a client? When they approach you.61) When should I say yes to a client? Every other conversation you ever have with them after that initial no.62) Should I have sex with an employee? Stop asking that.63) Should I negotiate the best terms with a VC? No. Pick the VC you like. Times are going to get tough at some point, and you need to be able to have a heart-to-heart with them.64) Should I even start a business? No. Make money. Build shit. Then start a business.65) Should I give employees bonuses for a job well done? No. Give them gifts but not bonuses.66) What should I do at Christmas? Send everyone you know a gift basket.67) If my customer just got divorced, what should I say to him? I can introduce you to lots of women/men.68) When should I give up on my idea? When you cant generate revenues, customers, interest, for two months.69) Why didnt the VC or customer call back after we met yesterday and it was great? They hate you.70) Why didnt the above call back after we met yesterday and it was great? Yesterday was like a split second ago for them and a lifetime for you. Theres the law of entrepreneurial relativity. Figure out what that means and live by it.71) Should I hire a professional CEO? No. Never.72) Should I hire a head of sales? No. The founder is the head of sales until at least 10 million in sales.73) My client called at 3 a.m. Should I tell him to respect boundaries? No. You no longer have any boundaries.74) I made a mistake. Should I tell the client? Yes. Tell him everything that happened. Youre his partner. Not the guy that hides things and then lies about them.75) My investors want me to focus. Should I listen to them? No. Diversify in every way you can.76) I personally need money.

Should I put them under the same roof and start consolidating? No. Not for at least two years.78) Should I quit my job? No. Only if you have salary that can pay you for six months at your startup. Aim to quit your job but dont quit your job.79) What do I do when I have doubts? Ask your customers if your doubts are trustworthy.80) I have too much competition. What should I do? Competition is good. It shows you have a decent business model. Now simply outperform them.81) My wife/husband thinks I spend too much time on my startup? Divorce them or close your business.82) Im starting my business, but I have relationship problems. What should I do? Get rid of your relationship.83) Should I expand geographically as quickly as possible? No. Get all the business you can in your local area. Travel is too expensive time-wise.84) How do I keep clients from yelling at me? Document every meeting line-by-line, and send your document to the client right after the meeting.85) I undercharged. What should I do about it? Nothing. Charge the next client more.86) I have an idea for an app but dont know how to execute. What should I do? Draw every screen and function. Then outsource someone to make the drawings look like they come from a real app. Then outsource the development of the app. Get a specific schedule. Micromanage the schedule.87) I want to buy a franchise in X. Is that a good idea? Only buy a franchise if its underperforming and you can see how to improve it. Dont buy on future hopes; only buy on past mistakes.88) I want to buy a franchise in X. Is that a good idea? Rely on the three Ds: Death, Debt, Divorce. When someone dies, the heirs will sell a business cheap. When someone is in debt, they will sell a business cheap. When someone divorces, the couple usually has to sell a business cheap. IMPORTANT: even if the trends in the industry are in your favor, you CANNOT predict the future. But you can use the past to help you get a deal. Always get a deal.89) I have a lot of traffic but no revenues. What should I do? Sell your business. Theres only one Google. (Well, there are two or three Googles: Facebook, Twitter  )90) I have no traffic. How do I get traffic? Shut down your business.91) Should I hire a PR firm? No. Do guerilla marketing. Read Newsjacking and Trust me Im Lying. PR firms screw up from beginning to end. The first time I hired a PR firm, instead of sending me my contract they accidentally sent me their contract for Terry Bradshaw. He was paying $12,000 a month. Was it worth it for him?92) My competition is doing better than me across every metric. What should I do? Dont be afraid to instantly shut down your business and start over if you cant sell it. Time is a horrible thing to waste.93) Ive been in business now for six years, and my business doesnt seem to be growing. Its even slowing down. What should I do? Come up with 10 ideas a day about new services your business can offer. Try to get a customer for each new service. I know one business in this situation that refuses to do this because their VCs are telling them to focus more. Youre going to go out of business otherwise.94) Is it unethical to run my business from the side while still at my job? I dont know. Did God tell you that in a dream?95) My customer called me at 5 p.m. on a Friday and said, We have to talk. And now I cant talk to him until Monday. What does it mean? It means youre fired.96) XYZ just sold for $100 million. Should I be valued at that? Im better! No, you should shut up.97) Investors want to meet me and customers want to meet me. Who do I meet if I need money? You should know the answer to that by now.98) If an acquirer asks me why I want to sell, what should I say? That you feel it would be easier for you to grow in the context of a bigger company that has experienced the growing pains you are just starting to go through. That 1+1 = 45.99) I just started my business. What should I do? Sell it as fast as possible (applies in 99 percent of situations). Sell for cash.100) I can change the world with my technology. No you cant.100a) Corollary: Dont smoke crack.101) If youre so smart why arent you a billionaire? Because I sold my businesses early, lost everything, started new businesses, sold them, and got lucky every now and then.101a) Corollary: These rules dont always apply. But like Kurt Vonnegut said, if you want to break the rules of grammar, first learn the rules of grammar.RULE #infinity: You create your luck by being healthy and not regretting the past or being anxious about the future.]',\n",
       "  153: '[In 2005 I was going to go out of business (again). My biggest investor had to pull out. His business had failed. He had a nervous twitch and whenever I ran into him he was constantly twitching, I need my money back, he told me.But I didnt have it I had invested it. It would be a year before I could give it to him. So I didnt know what to do. One time he threw a chair at me and ran out of the room. But there was nothing I could do.So I did what any normal 37 year old man in the fund of hedge funds business would do. I bought the book, The Tao of Star Wars. Because I knew deep down if I just surrendered to The Force then my business would be ok.I read the book every night before I went to sleep. I had confidence that it would save my business.And it did. Or I did. Or something did. My business didnt go under. That wouldnt happen for another year or so.A few weeks ago Cheryl Richardson, author of the book, The Art of Extreme Self-Care asked me and a bunch of people what movies impacted us the most. I jumped right out there, Star Wars because I believe in The Force. I think someone else said Schindlers List.I saw Star Wars when I was seven years old and it changed my life.I tried to explain the story to my dad and he gave me wise advice, I can never follow when someone tries to tell me a story. I now repeat that sentence almost every day to people who try to tell me boring stories.Nobody knows whats true and whats fake. We all have faith in something: usually a mixture of some personal beliefs with modern science. I am like that also. Mostly, I just believe in what works for me.The Force works for me. I admit it.Heres how to be a Jedi KnightA) Rest when you have nothing to do. When Qui-Gon is fighting Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace a transparent door closes, dividing them. Darth Maul paces back and forth and Qui Gon simply sits and rests and seems to be doing nothing.It doesnt matter to me that Darth Maul kills Qui-Gon at the end of that fight. Qui-Jon comes back later. Whatever.In modern society we all feel like we have to be like Darth Maul. Pacing, finding a purpose, being anxious, stressed, waiting for doors to open. But how great is it to just rest and be happy and not move when you dont have to.I will tell you: its great.B) Less. Get rid of everything you dont need. Obi-Wan lives in a cave or a hut for 40 years when hes on Tatooine. Yoda, who was ruler of the Universe, lives in a swamp after he loses his battle with the Emperor. They were still capable of laughing, of living, of staying healthy, of being able to train the next generation. They didnt need anything to keep them entertained.Of course, I have to keep repeating, its a story. But this is the way I would like to live.C) Practice being good. Being a good, compassionate person is not something like having two arms or being able to see. Its a quality we develop over years and thousands of hours of practice. Most people are not good people. In business, in art, in almost every world Ive been in, most people I meet are pretty gray to black. It takes practice to be the person who is a source of compassion and honesty.Supposedly it takes 10,000 hours to master something. Unfortunately, most people spend 10,000 hours trying to be a jerk to others. If all you do is put in your 10,000 with small kindnesses, then the universe will return that many times over.D) Read. Clearly George Lucas read many spiritual texts before he wrote even the first Star Wars or conceived of the whole saga. Id start with the Tao Te Ching and then various interpretations of it. Then Id go with any stories of Chuang Tzu, Buddha, Thich Naht Hanh, and Id read The Art of Happiness by the Dalai Lama.I dont think one should be a taoist or a Buddhist. I doubt that Buddha was a Buddhist, which is just a label. Nor should one be a Jedi-ist. Theres no reason to separate yourself out from all of the other people. Just read texts that are inspiring.E) Think About What You Read. If you read one page of the Tao Te Ching theres probably enough in there to think about it for a year. Try it. Theres a saying, reading spiritual texts is good, thinking about them is 100 times better, practicing what you read is 100,000 times better. So think and practice.F) Health. In all of the movies I never saw an out of shape Jedi. Although there seems to be a deep spiritual componenet to being a Jedi, clearly there is a physical health component as well. They are jumping out of spaceships, fighting with light sabers, and they can probably run a four minute mile. Heck, even Yoda at the age of 800 is jumping all over the place.Why is health important? Buddha doesnt talk about health. Jesus doesnt mention health.Health is not important. But sickness is. If you are sick, then your thoughts will be stapled to that sickness. You cant get rid of it. Youre in pain and pain takes up the mind. This is why The Yoga Sutras is not about looking good in a yoga studio and picking up girls (although that is a good use of it). Its about staying physically and emotionally healthy so you can focus on your spiritual life.G) Be around other Jedis. Once Anakin starts hanging out with Darth Sidious he becomes a bad guy. Here are some things that are hard in life: being honest, being kind, trying to add value to others. These things take time and energy. When you are around people who steal your energy then those things become even harder.H) Be open-minded. The difference between Luke and Han in the original Star Wars. Luke is willing to believe. Theres a lot of issues people get stapled to almost as if they were sicknesses. Some core issues: pro-choice vs pro-life. war vs anti-war. college vs no-college, global warming, etc.Im not saying one side is right and one side is wrong. When you find yourself thinking, This side is DEFINITELY right be willing to open your mind and look at why the other side thinks the way they do. Its never for the stupid reasons you think it is. Issues are just ways for the mind to practice being open-minded. Strong opinions are ways for the mind to get stapled to this planet, filled with so many myths and manipulations.This is good practice for the actual hard decisions you have to make in your life. Else your brain gets too soft and one-sided. I) Trust. Luke has to watch Obi-Wan die. Han has to be captured by bounty hunters. Anakin has to be recruited as a little kid. Qui-Jon has to die. Yoda has to go into exile. Bad things happen. But if you follow steps A-H, bad things happen in cycles. Good things also. Trusting that the kindness you are putting out there is compounding in a secret bank account for you means waiting for that bank account to deliver its returns. It will.J) James is crazy. Yeah, I am. But I believe it.My business did get saved. Then it went out of business. The my next business got bought. Then it went down the drain. Then my marriage disintegrated. Then I got married again to the woman of my dreams. Then I lost all of my writing jobs. Now I write more than ever. Then I lost many friends. Now I have more friends than ever.Everyone thought Old Ben was crazy. And he probably was. He died at the end of that movie. Just like the rest of us will.]',\n",
       "  154: '[    In 2002 I was driving to a hedge fund managers house to hopefully raise money from him. I was two hours late. This was pre-GPS and I had no cell phone. I was totally lost.I kept playing over and over again Lose Yourself by Eminem.I was afraid this was my one shot and I was blowing it. I was even crying in my car. I was going broke and I felt this was my one chance. What a loser.Finally I got there. The hedge fund manager was dressed all in pink. His house was enormous. Maybe 20,000 square feet. His cook served us a great meal. I had made him wait two hours to eat. And he had cancer at the time. I felt really bad.Then we played chess and it was fun and he gave me a tour of the house. One room was just for toys made in 1848. He had a squash court inside the house.Another room had weird artifacts like the handwritten notes from when Lennon and McCartney were first writing down the lyrics for Hey Jude.Another was the official signed statement by Ted Kennedy in the police station after he reported the Chappaquiddick accident that may have ultimately played a part in his decision to not run for president.Eventually I did raise money from this manager and it started a new life for me.But thats not why I bring up Eminem at all.The song Lose Yourself is from the movie 8 Mile. Although I recommend it, you dont have to see it to understand what I am about to write. Ill give you everything you need to know.Eminem is a genius at sales and competition and he shows it in one scene in the movie.A scene I will break down for you line by line so you will know everything there is to know about sales, cognitive bias, and defeating your competition.First, heres all you need to know about the movie.Eminem plays a poor, no-collar, self-proclaimed white trash guy living in a trailer park. Hes beaten on, works crappy jobs, gets betrayed, etc. But he lives to rap and break out somehow.In the first scene he is having a battle against another rapper and he chokes. He gives up without saying a word. Hes known throughout the movie as someone who chokes under pressure and he seems doomed for failure.Until he chooses himself.The scene I will show you and then break down is the final battle in the movie. Hes the only white guy and the entire audience is black. Hes up against the reigning champion that the audience loves.He wins the battle and I will show you how. With his techniques you can go up against any competition.First off, watch the scene (with lyrics) before and after my explanation.Here is the scene: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gatNLacOjC8Watch it right now.Ok, lets break it down. How did Eminem win so easily?Setting aside his talent for a moment (assume both sides are equally talented), Eminem used a series of cognitive biases to win the battle.The human brain was developed over the past 400,000 years. In fact, arguably, when the brain was used more to survive in nomadic situations, humans had higher IQs then they had today.But one very important thing is that the brain developed many biases as short-cuts to survival.For instance, a very common one is that we have a bias towards noticing negative news over positive news.The reason is simple: if you were in the jungle and you saw a lion to your right and an apple tree to your left, you would best ignore the apple tree and run as fast as possible away from the lion.This is called negativity bias and its the entire reason newspapers still survive by very explicitly exploiting this bias in humans.We no longer need those short-cuts as much. There arent that many lions in the street. But the brain took 400,000 years to evolve and its only in the past 50 years maybe that we are relatively safe from most of the dangers that threatened earlier humans.Our technology and ideas have evolved but our brains cant evolve fast enough to keep up with them. Consequently, these biases are used in almost every sales campaign, business, marketing campaign, movie, news, relationship, everything.Almost all of your interactions are dominated by biases, and understanding them is helpful when calling BS on your thoughts or the actions of others.You have to learn how to reach past the signals from the brain and develop intuition and mastery over these biases.1) In-group BiasNotice Eminems first line: Now everybody from the 313, put your mother-f*cking hands up and follow me.The 313 is the area code for Detroit. And not just Detroit. Its for blue-collar Detroit where the entire audience, and Eminem, is from.So he wipes away the outgroup bias that might be associated with his race and he changes the conversation to who is in 313 and who is NOT in 313.2) Herd BehaviorHe said, put your hands up and follow me. Everyone starts putting their hands up without thinking. So their brain tells them that they are doing this for rational reasons.For instance, they are now following Eminem.3) Availability CascadeThe brain has a tendency to believe things if they are repeated, regardless of whether or not they are true. This is called Availability Cascade.Notice Eminem repeats his first line. After he does that he no longer needs to say follow me. He says, look, look.He is setting up the next cognitive bias.4) Distinction Bias Or Outgroup Bias Brains have a tendency to view two things as very different if they are evaluated at the same time as opposed to if they were evaluated separately.Eminem wants his opponent Papa Doc to be evaluated right then as someone different from the group, even though the reality is they are all in the same group of friends with similar interests, etc.Eminem says: Now while he stands tough, notice that this man did not have his hands up.In other words, even though Papa Doc is black, like everyone in the audience, he is no longer in the group that Eminem has defined and commanded: the 313 group.He has completely changed the conversation from race to area code.5) Ambiguity BiasHe doesnt refer to Papa Doc by name. He says this man. In other words, theres the 313 group which we are all a part of in the audience and now there is this ambiguous man who is attempting to invade us.Watch presidential campaign debates. A candidate will rarely refer to another candidate by name. Instead, he might say, All of my opponents might think X, but we here know that Y is better.When the brain starts to view a person with ambiguity it gets confused and CANT MAKE CHOICES involving that ambiguity. So the person without ambiguity wins.6) Credential BiasBecause the brain wants to take short cuts, it will look for information more from people with credentials or lineage than from people who come out of nowhere.So, for instance, if one person was from Harvard and told you it was going to rain today and another random person told you it was going to be sunny today you might be more inclined to believe the person from Harvard.Eminem does this subtly two lines later. He says, one, two, three, and to the four.This is a direct line from Snoop Doggy Doggs first song with Dr. Dre, Aint Nothin But a G Thing. It is the first line in the song and perhaps one of the most well-known rap lines ever.Eminem directly associates himself with well-known successful rappers Dr. Dre and Snoop when he uses that line.He then uses Availability Cascade again by saying, one Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four. First, hes using that one, two, three, and to the four again but this time with Pac, which refers to the rapper Tupac. So now hes associated himself in this little battle in Detroit with three of the greatest rappers ever.7) Ingroup/OutgroupEminem points to random people in the audience and says Youre Pac, Hes Pac, including them with himself in associating their lineages with these great rappers.But then he points to his opponent, Papa Doc, makes a gesture like his head is being sliced off and says, Youre Pac, NONE. Meaning that Papa Doc has no lineage, no credibility, unlike Eminem and the audience.8) Basic Direct Marketing: List The Objections Up FrontAny direct marketer or salesperson knows the next technique Eminem uses.When you are selling a product, or yourself, or even going on a debate or convincing your kids to clean up their room, the person or group you are selling to is going to have easy objections.They know those objections and you know those objections. If you dont bring them up and they dont bring them up then they will not buy your product.If they bring it up before you, then it looks like you were hiding something and you just wasted a little of their time by forcing them to bring it up. So a great sales technique is to address all of the objections in advance.Eminems next set of lines does this brilliantly.He says, I know everything hes got to say against me.And then he just lists them one by one:I am white I am a fuckin bum I do live in a trailer with my mom My boy, Future, is an Uncle Tom I do have a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob who shot himself with his own gun. I did get jumped by all six of you chumpsAnd so on. He lists several more.But at the end of the list, theres no more criticism you can make of him. Hes addressed everything and dismissed them. In a rap battle, (or a sales pitch), if you address everything your opponent can say, hes left with nothing to say.When he has nothing to say, the audience, or the sales prospect, your date, your kids, whoever, will buy from you or listen to what you have to say.Look at direct marketing letters you get in email. They all spend pages and pages addressing your concerns. This is one of the most important techniques in direct marketing.9) Humor BiasEminem saves his best for last. But I know Something About You he says while staring at Papa Doc.He sings it playfully, making it stand out and almost humorous. There is something called Humor Bias. People remember things that are stated humorously more than they remember serious things.10) Extreme OutgroupYou went to Cranbook. And then Eminem turns to his 313 group for emphasis as he explains what Cranbook is. Thats a private school.BAM!Theres no way now the audience can be on Papa Docs side but Eminem makes the outgroup even larger. His real names Clarence. And his parents have a real good marriage.BAM and BAM! Two more things that separate Papa Doc from the crowd. Hes a nerdy guy, who goes to a rich school, and his parents are together.Unlike probably everyone in the audience, including Eminem. No wonder Papa Doc doesnt live in the 313, which was originally stated somewhat humorously but is now proven without a doubt.11) Credential bias (again)Eminmen says, There aint no such thing as and the audience chants with him because they know exactly what he is quoting from Halfway Crooks! a line from a song by Mobb Deep (I did their website back in 1998), another huge East Coast rap group. So now Eminem has established lineage between himself and both the West Coast and the East Coast.And by using the audience to say Halfway Crooks were all in the same group again while Clarence goes back to his home with his parents at the end of the show.12) ScarcityThe music stops, which means Eminem has to stop and let Papa Doc have his turn. But he doesnt. He basically says F*ck everybody, F*ck yall if you doubt me. I dont wanna win. Im outtie.He makes himself scarce. After establishing total credibility with the audience he basically says he doesnt want what they have to offer.He reduces the supply of himself by saying hes out of there. Maybe he will never come back. Reduce the supply of yourself while demand is going up and what happens? Basic economics. Value goes up.Hes so thoroughly dominated the battle that now, in reversal to the beginning of the movie, Papa Doc chokes. He doesnt quite choke, though. Theres nothing left to say. Eminem has said it all for him.Theres no way Papa Doc can raise any objections because Eminem has already addressed them all. All he can do is defend himself, which will give him the appearance of being weak. And hes so thoroughly not in the 313 Group that there is no way to get back in there.Theres simply nothing left to say. So Eminem wins the battle.And what does Eminem do with his victory? He can do anything.But he walks away from the entire subculture. He walks off at the end of the movie with no connection to what he fought for.Hes going to Choose Himself to be successful and not rely on the small-time thinking in battles in Detroit.Hes sold 220 million records worldwide. He discovered and produced 50 Cent who has sold hundreds of millions more (and is another example of Choose Yourself as Robert Greene so aptly describes in his book The 50th Law).Doesnt it seem silly to analyze a rap song for ideas how to be better at sales and communicating? I dont know. You tell me. Ive exposed myself so much in my blog posts. In fact, I dont hit Publish on something unless Im afraid of how people will react.When you expose yourself there are many many ways for people to attack you. People will stab you and hurt you. But you cant create art unless you show how unique you are while being inclusive with others who share your problems.Im still scared when I hit publish. But I love that final feeling of risk and fear. The rush. The carriage return. Click.]',\n",
       "  155: '[Here are the rules: Ive been at zero a few times, come back a few times, and done it over and over. Ive started entire new careers. People who knew me then, dont me now. And so on.Ive had to change careers several times. Sometimes because my interests changed. Sometimes because all bridges have been burned beyond recognition, sometimes because I desperately needed money. And sometimes just because I hated everyone in my old career or they hated me.There are other ways to reinvent yourself, so take what I say with a grain of salt. This is what worked for me.Ive seen it work for maybe a few hundred other people. Through interviews, through people writing me letters, through the course of the past 20 years. You can try it or not.A) Reinvention never stops.Every day you reinvent yourself. Youre always in motion. But you decide every day: forward or backward.B) You start from scratch.Every label you claim you have from before is just vanity. You were a doctor? You were Ivy League? You had millions? You had a family? Nobody cares. You lost everything. Youre a zero. Dont try to say youre anything else.C) You need a mentor.Else, youll sink to the bottom. Someone has to show you how to move and breathe. But dont worry about finding a mentor (see below).D) Three types of mentors\\n\\nDirect. Someone who is in front of you who will show you how they did it. What is it? Wait. By the way, mentors arent like that old Japanese guy in The Karate Kid. Ultimately most mentors will hate you.\\n\\n\\nIndirect. Books. Movies. You can outsource 90 percent of mentorship to books and other materials. 200-500 books equals one good mentor. People ask me, What is a good book to read? I never know the answer. There are 200-500 good books to read. I would throw in inspirational books. Whatever are your beliefs, underline them through reading every day.\\n\\nEverything is a mentor. If you are a zero, and have passion for reinvention, then everything you look at will be a metaphor for what you want to do. The tree you see, with roots you dont, with underground water that feeds it, is a metaphor for computer programming if you connect the dots. And everything you look at, you will connect the dots.\\nE) Dont worry if you dont have passion for anything.You have passion for your health. Start there. Take baby steps. You dont need a passion to succeed. Do what you do with love and success is a natural symptom.F) Time it takes to reinvent yourself: five years.Heres a description of the five years:\\n\\nYear One: youre flailing and reading everything and just starting to DO.\\n\\n\\nYear Two: you know who you need to talk to and network with. Youre Doing every day. You finally know what the monopoly board looks like in your new endeavors.\\n\\n\\nYear Three: youre good enough to start making money. It might not be a living yet.\\n\\n\\nYear Four: youre making a good living\\n\\n\\nYear Five: youre making wealth\\n\\nSometimes I get frustrated in years 1-4. I say, why isnt it happening yet? and I punch the floor and hurt my hand and throw a coconut on the floor in a weird ritual. Thats okay. Just keep going. Or stop and pick a new field. It doesnt matter. Eventually youre dead and then its hard to reinvent yourself.G) If you do this faster or slower then you are doing something wrong. Google is a good example.H) Its not about the money. But money is a decent measuring stick.When people say its not about the money they should make sure they have a different measuring stick.What about just doing what you love? There will be many days when you dont love what you are doing. If you are doing it just for love then it will take much much longer than five years.Happiness is just a positive perception from our brain. Some days you will be unhappy. Our brain is a tool we use. Its not who we are.I) When can you say, I do X! where X is your new career? Today.J) When can I start doing X?Today. If you want to paint, then buy a canvas and paints today, start buying 500 books one at a time, and start painting. If you want to write do these three things:\\n\\nRead\\n\\n\\nWrite\\n\\n\\nTake your favorite author and type your favorite story of his word for word. Wonder to yourself why he wrote each word. Hes your mentor today.\\n\\nIf you want to start a business, start spec-ing out the idea for your business. Reinvention starts today. Every day.K) How do I make money?By year three youve put in 5,000-7,000 hours. Thats good enough to be in the top 200-300 in the world in anything. The top 200 in almost any field makes a living.By year three you will know how to make money. By year four you will scale that up and make a living. Some people stop at year four.L) By year five youre in the top 30-50 so can make wealth.M) What is it? How do I know what I should do?Whatever area you feel like reading 500 books about. Go to the bookstore and find it. If you get bored three months later go back to the bookstore.Its okay to get disillusioned. Thats what failure is about. Success is better than failure but the biggest lessons are found in failure.Very important: Theres no rush. You will reinvent yourself many times in an interesting life. You will fail to reinvent many times. Thats fun also.Many reinventions make your life a book of stories instead of a textbook.Some people want the story of their life to be a textbook. For better or worse, mine is a book of stories.Thats why reinvention happens every day.N) The choices you make today will be in your biography tomorrow.Make interesting choices and you will have an interesting biography.N1) The choices you make today will be in your biology tomorrow.O) What if I like something obscure? Like biblical archaeology or 11th-century warfare?Repeat all of the steps above, and then in year five you will make wealth. We have no idea how. Dont look to find the end of the road when you are still at the very first step.P) What if my family wants me to be an accountant?How many years of your life did you promise your family? Ten years? Your whole life? Then wait until the next life. The good thing is: you get to choose.Choose freedom over family. Freedom over preconceptions. Freedom over government. Freedom over people-pleasing. Then you will be pleased.Q) My mentor wants me to do it HIS way.Thats fine. Learn HIS way. Then do it YOUR way. With respect.Hopefully nobody has a gun to your head. Then you have to do it their way until the gun is put down.R) My spouse is worried about who will support/take care of kids?Then after you work 16 hours a day, seven days a week being a janitor, use your spare time to reinvent.Someone who is reinventing ALWAYS has spare time. Part of reinvention is collecting little bits and pieces of time and re-carving them the way you want them to be.S) What if my friends think Im crazy?What friends?T) What if I want to be an astronaut?Thats not a reinvention. Thats a specific job. If you like outer space there are many careers. Richard Branson wanted to be an astronaut and started Virgin Galactic.U) What if I like to go out drinking and partying?Read this post again in a year.V) What if Im busy cheating on my husband or wife or betraying a partner?Read this post again in two or three years when you are broke and jobless and nobody likes you.W) What if I have no skills at all?Read B again.X) What if I have no degree or I have a useless degree?Read B again.Y) What if I have to focus on paying down my debt and mortgage?Read R again.Z) How come I always feel like Im on the outside looking in?Albert Einstein was on the outside looking in. Nobody in the establishment would even hire him.Everyone feels like a fraud at some point. The highest form of creativity is born out of skepticism.AA) I cant read 500 books. What one book should I read for inspiration?Give up.BB) What if Im too sick to reinvent?Reinvention will boost every healthy chemical in your body: serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin. Keep moving forward and you might not get healthy but you will get healthier. Dont use health as an excuse.Finally, reinvent your health first. Sleep more hours. Eat better. Exercise. These are key steps to reinvention.CC) What if my last partner screwed me and Im still suing him?Stop litigating and never think about him again. Half the problem was you, not him.DD) What if Im going to jail?Perfect. Reread B. Read a lot of books in jail.EE) What if Im shy?Make your weaknesses your strengths. Introverts listen better, focus better, and have ways of being more endearing.FF) What if I cant wait five years?If you plan on being alive in five years then you might as well start today.GG) How should I network?Make concentric circles. Youre at the middle.The next circle is friends and family.The next circle is online communities.The circle after that is meetups and coffees.The circle after that is conferences and thought leaders.The circle after that is mentors.The circle after that is customers and wealth-creators.Start making your way through the circles.HH) What happens when I have ego about what I do?In 6-12 months youll be back at BII) What if Im passionate about two things? What if I cant decide?Combine them and youll be the best in the world at the combination.JJ) What if Im so excited I want to teach what Im learning?Start teaching on YouTube. Start with an audience of one and see if it builds up.KK) What if I want to make money while I sleep?In year four, start outsourcing what you do.LL) How do I meet mentors and thought leaders?Once you have enough knowledge (after 100-200 books), write down 10 ideas for 20 different potential mentors.None of them will respond. Write down 10 more ideas for 20 new mentors. Repeat every week.Put together a newsletter for everyone who doesnt respond. Keep repeating until someone responds. Blog about your learning efforts. Build community around you being an expert.MM) What if I cant come up with ideas?Then keep practicing coming up with ideas. The idea muscle atrophies. You have to build it up.Its hard for me to touch my toes if I havent been doing it every day. I have to do it every day for a while before I can easily touch my toes. Dont expect to come up with good ideas on day one.NN) What else should I read?AFTER books, read websites, forums, magazines. But most of that is garbage.OO) What if I do everything you say but it still doesnt seem like its working?It will work. Just wait. Keep reinventing every day.Dont try and find the end of the road. You cant see it in the fog. But you can see the next step and you do know that if you take that next step eventually you get to the end of the road.PP) What if I get depressed?Sit in silence for one hour a day. You need to get back to your core.If you think this sounds stupid then dont do it. Stay depressed.QQ) What if I dont have time to sit in silence?Then sit in silence for two hours a day. This is not meditation. This is just sitting.RR) What if I get scared?Sleep 8-9 hours a day and never gossip. Sleep is the No. 1 key to successful health. Its not the only key. Its just No. 1. Some people write to me and say, I only need four hours of sleep or in my country sleeping means laziness. Well, those people will fail and die young.What about gossip? The brain biologically wants to have 150 friends. Then when you are with one of your friends you can gossip about any of the other 150. If you dont have 150 friends then the brain wants to read gossip magazines until it thinks it has 150 friends.Dont be as stupid as your brain.SS) What if I keep feeling like nothing ever works out for me?Spend 10 minutes a day practicing gratitude. Dont suppress the fear. Notice the anger.But also allow yourself to be grateful for the things you do have. Anger is never inspirational but gratitude is. Gratitude is the bridge between your world and the parallel universe where all creative ideas live.TT) What if I have to deal with personal bullshit all the time?Find new people to be around.Someone who is reinventing herself will constantly find people to try and bring her down. The brain is scared of reinvention because it might not be safe.Biologically, the brain wants you to be safe and reinvention is a risk. So it will throw people in your path who will try to stop you.Learn how to say no.UU) What if Im happy at my cubicle job?Good luck.VV) Why should I trust you  youve failed so many times?Dont trust me.WW) Will you be my mentor?Youve just read this post.]'},\n",
