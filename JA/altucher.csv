I'm Giving Away 30 Books Written By My Heroes,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/im-giving-away-30-books-written-my-heroes-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,5994,222,38,2015-06-05 00:00:00,9.0,"Be honest with me. You're 12 years old. Don't you feel that way?On any given day, I'm somewhere in between 12 and 17 years old. Claudia, I'm sure, will gladly tell you that I'm mostly 12. It doesn't matter that I live inside a 47 year old body. I sort of feel 47 year old ""men"" wear suits. And they drink whiskey. And they read GQ. And maybe they check out the interior of a new car. Or they know how to turn on the motor of a boat. Or sometimes they can fix things (non-jews). I do admit, I like to wear a tuxedo. But only if it's five in the morning and Claudia hasn't woken up yet and I know it's good for at least one laugh. If I get one laugh out of her to start my day then that's like starting the motor of the boat. But here's the real reason I know I'm somewhere between 12 and 17. When I read a book that I LOVE I like to think I can call up the author and ask him all my questions about the book. Most of the time people don't want to talk to me. Ugh! So I started a podcast in order to have an excuse. In order to sound like I'm 47. Now I can say, ""well I spoke with X, Y, and Z. Can you talk to me also?"" Maybe that helps a little. When I worked at HBO in the 90s it was easy. I could go up to any person in the street at 3 in the morning and say, ""hi, I work at HBO. Can I ask you some questions?"" It helped that I had a camera crew with me. But podcasting is similar. I get to talk to all of these superheroes and ask them where they got their super powers and how I can get them also. It's changed my life. So I want to give you the most recent books I've read by the superheroes who have talked to me. I'm giving away 5 sets of 30 books for free.Here's the link to potentially get the books. I hope you win. But even if you don't, I hope some of these books look fun for you and you buy them.

10 Ways To Supercharge Your Superhero Hormone,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-ways-supercharge-your-sudperhero-hormone-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,8099,286,33,2015-06-04 00:00:00,9.0,"One of them is dead. The other disappeared and is probably dead. One, I think, committed suicide but I'm afraid to ask her brother if that's true.Another went crazy and I had to block him on my Facebook page. And the other I lost track of.They were my best friends growing up.In college I can't remember who any of my friends were. In graduate school I had a ""best friend"" but then I didn't go to his wedding and I felt too ashamed to call him about it and now we don't talk anymore. I don't keep in touch with anyone from my first job. And of all the people in my first business, only one keeps in touch with me. And of the 500 or so people in my second business, one keeps in touch with me. I haven't been very good at bonding. I haven't been very good at friendship. And although I like to think I might have been kind at moments it doesn't seem to have borne any fruits in my current day. Oxytocin is the bonding hormone. It's the neurotransmitter that shoots through your brain when you bond with someone, when you kiss someone, when someone trusts you, causing among other things, happiness. I was always so focused on fake external goals that I never focused on how I could clean my own internal, to make my life better. I lacked oxytocin. Oxytocin also has benefits that can make your life better. It is sometimes considered the ""super hormone"". It is sometimes called ""the love hormone"".",2015-06-04T14:33:10.000Z
Do You Have A Good Eulogy Resume?

I found an envelope filled with objects that I had somehow missed when I was throwing stuff out a few months ago. I recognized the handwriting immediately. It was from someone who had been dead for 15 years. I must have been carrying this around with me everywhere. It contained all sorts of notes, articles, and objects my grandfather had collected about me over the years. Whenever I called him he apparently wrote notes in meticulous handwriting about what we spoke about, particularly if I got a good grade on a test or was proud of something. There's also about 40 baseball cards in there that I had collected when I was eight years old (I could see on the backs of the cards when they were from) that he thought might be worth something (Joe Torre, Pete Rose, etc). He also saved my very first resume. It was pathetic. ""Wrote a program to simulate water flows in the Agronomy Department"". What? I can't even remember that job. ""Related Courses"" I have ""Discrete Structures"". Little did I know that I ended up not being very ""discreet"". And now, I'm embarrassed to say, under ""Interests"" I put ""Kung Fu"". What the hell?And I had my two addresses. My college address and my ""permanent address"" which is where my parents lived and I guess I still felt that was ""home"". But my grandparents saved it. Maybe I would need the paper version one day to remind me of my many accomplishments at age 21. I showed the envelope to Claudia. She read every note in there. She said, ""they must have loved you"" and I guess they did. Grandparents, no matter how crazy they were in their lives, tend to love grandchildren. I would call them and tell them all my plans (""wants to be Governor after he is President so he can relax"" says a note from when I was 12 years old) and they would listen. Love is a gift that is given. Accepting the love is the gift you can give back. I wonder if I accepted it enough with them. Nobody at my funeral will bring up ""Discrete Structures"". And certainly nobody will bring up ""Agronomy"" or what my permanent address was. And please, God, I confess to lying about the Kung Fu part. Don't hold it against me! There's the work resume and then there's your eulogy resume, which I hope for me is totally different. I hope people will say:",2015-06-02T14:35:26.000Z

He worked in a navy shipyard fixing things. He was working on figuring out how sensitive instruments can remain stable if battleships were rocking back and forth during rough seas. Then something bad happened. Something that changed his life. He dropped a metal coil he was working on. It walked. He went home to his wife and said, ""I think I can make a coil that can walk down a staircase"". So, during his spare time while saving the world in the middle of a war, he kept playing around with metal coils until he had one that could walk down the staircase. His wife Betty named it a Slinky.Richard and his wife, Betty, set up the ""James Spring and Wire Company"" and figured the orders would start pouring in. They didn't. About a year later, the department store Gimbels gave them some space to display the toy. Nobody looked at them.Frustrated, Richard put a platform diagonally underneath the Slinky so kids could see how it walks. They sold out of all 400.In 1960, Richard disappeared to South America to become a missionary evangelical. He gave Betty control of the business. She never saw him again and he died in the jungles 14 years later.At the time he left, the business was completely failing, was over a million in debt, and she had six children to raise by herself after she and Richard divorced.She sold 300 million Slinkys (two or three billion dollars worth in today's dollars) and eventually sold the company in 1998.People all the time ask: ""what career should I choose?"" or ""What is my passion?"" I feel for them. There is a lot of pressure to simply KNOW what you are going to do for the rest of your life. Even though the economy seems statistically good - money and opportunity feel scarce. Feel depressing. Feel scary. Many people are scared. But these questions (career, passion) are excuses. Nobody thinks about their ""passion"" until they are old enough to be scared they don't have one.

How To Be A Bad Leader,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-bad-leader-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,96245,1253,268,2015-05-28 00:00:00,11.0,"I am the best bad leader in the world. Not only do I know everything about how to fail as a leader but I also have spent large amounts of time with bad leaders.This is a UNIQUE opportunity for you to hear what the top 11 qualities are of bad leaders. All of the time I read articles, ""Top 10 Qualities of GREAT Leaders"".Why do people write these articles? Were they great leaders? I have no idea. In most cases it doesn't seem so. It seems like they write a lot of articles about leaders. Study is one thing, writing is the next thing, but doing and then repeat is how you learn. So why do they write these articles? They write them to get name recognition. They write them to get consulting gigs. To be a life coach maybe to other leaders or CEOS. They write them to get speaking gigs.And that technique works. I know this. If you write enough articles about leadership, someone will pay you to teach them how to be a leader. Try it and you'll see.But I have to stick with what I know. I know a thing or two about good leadership. But good leadership is very rare. I can count a list of good leaders on my two hands. Larry Page is a good leader. Maybe Winston Churchill was a good leader but I don't know.Sometimes, to be a little bit better, you just have to avoid the little bit worse. So let's get started. The qualities of a bad leader.A) NOT UNDERSTANDING THE 30/150 RULEA leader has to follow the 30 / 150 rule or they will be a bad leader.This rule has worked for 200,000 years. If a rule works for 2 years then ignore it. If a rule has worked for 200,000 years then pay attention to it.For 200,000 years humans were tribes. Every tribe had a leader but when the tribe got too big for one leader (more than 30 people), it would split in two. Then, around 70,000 years ago we evolved to handle tribes up to 150 people.Then maybe 10,000 years ago we figured out how to be above 150 people. But this is so new, an evolutionary blip, that we screw it up all the time.But for each of these three categories (&lt; 30 people, &lt; 150 people, &gt; 150 people) bad leaders have different opportunities to prove themselves if they don't understand how the nature of leadership changes based on size of population.B) UNDER 30 PEOPLE: AVOIDING ONE ON ONE GIVINGIf you are a leader of less than 30 people, you have to know intimately the problems of all 30 people (or less) in your organization.You have to know their skills. What they are good at. What they are bad at. What they want to be good at. What their dreams are.Each person should be assigned ONE thing. That's their responsibility. Bad leaders give people many things and then those people do mediocre jobs at all of them instead of being responsible for their one special egg they have to carry from one side of the room to the other on a spoon.When I was running a company with less than 30 people I would take random employees with me to meetings. This way they would see the effect the company had on our clients. My goal: I knew I had limitations as a leader. So I wanted my employees to be leaders.Bad leaders get jealous of the people underneath them and never hire people smarter than them. This is the #1 most common thing a bad leader does. Bad leaders don't want people to rise up higher than them. Good leaders train people to rise up higher than them. Understand each of the 30 people at an intimate level. Know who their parents are. Know what they do for fun. Help them maximize their skills. Make them succeed and shine past you. Bad leaders die lonely as the 30 people leave, one by one. C) ABOVE 30 PEOPLE, BUT BELOW 150: HOW TO SCREW IT UPWhen your organization is between 30 and 150, it's impossible for you to know everyone.So make sure everyone is talking about everyone else. I want to be able to ask A what B is like to work with and I want a real good answer.The people reporting directly to you should be giving more than they are getting to the people working for them. And then thats how the leader, indirectly, gets to know the entire 150 when he or she is putting together teams and assignments and trying to inspire people for a common goal.D) FAILING THE ""VISION THING""Above 150 people you need to do many things.But here's the #1 thing leaders fail at. No vision.What's a vision? I suppose a 1000 boring books can be written about this. Let's hold off for a second on defining it.But above 150, it's impossible to know everyone in your organization or even know second-hand about everyone in your organization. So the most important thing you can do, in fact the ONLY thing you can do, is lead by example. Show that you all share a common story and vision. For instance, what if 50,000 people are in your organization. Or in the case of the President of the United Stated, 300 million people.You can't unify the people by talking to each one and understanding their problems. You can't define roles and fulfill dreams for people by talking to others who know everyone.You have to unify them with a story. A story everyone believes in and is inspired by and is willing to follow. So if you and I believe in the Yankees, we're more likely to trust each other than if I like the Yankees and you like the Mets.All stories: religions, nationalism, politics, issues, etc are more or less designed to figure out how to unify the greatest number of people with the strongest ties possible.Because we are not so good at it, often this degrades into wars, or poor leadership, or things just disappear into the furnace of time.When Tim Cook became CEO of Apple, everyone was afraid the story would change. The stock dropped.What was the story? It wasn't that Steve Jobs ""gets the most profits"". A story is rarely about money (although money itself is probably the strongest story on the planet).It's that Steve Jobs had the greatest combination of ""technology + design"". Could Tim Cook keep that story going? Tim Cook's leadership will be entirely judged on whether he keeps that story going or if he can successfully change the story.Actually, he has to do both. Because if he tries to turn himself into Steve Jobs then he will be judged on the story of: ""is Tim Cook just a bad version of Steve Jobs.""So it's a delicate balance. One that has to be dealt with every day in order for him to attract the best employees, keep his customers happy, keep his investors happy, and probably to keep himself happy.This is leadership.E) HAVING A BAD VISIONOk, let's get closer to defining a bad vision. Good visions are difficult to come up with. It's pretty rare.But since I know so many bad leaders I can tell you first an example of bad visions.I've been in the management of at least two companies worth over a billion dollars. In both cases, leadership was horrible.How did they get to a billion dollars with such bad leadership? Easy. Anyone can do that part. I will tell you how.They went public on the stock market and then used their shares to buy other companies. If you buy a lot of small companies then suddenly you're a messed up big company. Your only vision was: ""we just bought a lot of companies that do the same thing and now we have a billion dollars in revenues!""Ach! Your vision might even be worse than that. It might be ""We just bought a lot of companies, fired all of the HR people and accounting people (because we had ""synergy"") and now we have a billion in revenues and even greater profits and margins!""""Synergy"" means ""bad story"". Every company that has ever done that has failed.Some companies did that and came close to failing. For example, Google never had a chance of failing. But they were buying a company a week when Eric Schmidt was the CEO. They weren't quite bringing these companies in under the fold correctly and Google was starting to flounder. Divisions were being shut down. Morale was at a low because the vision of Google was starting to flounder. Larry Page took over and changed the story. He said, ""Google is the best in the world at these four things"" and he closed down everything that wasn't part of one of those four silos.Everyone left in one of those silos can now say, ""We are the best in the world at this"" and that contributes to the larger vision of Google of having the entirety of world information at your fingertips wherever you are. The first company in world history to do this.Man, I wish I worked at Google, to be honest. It almost happened once when I tried to sell a company to them. I loved their vision so much I wanted to bathe every inch of my body in it. I wanted to be religious about it.And that's what all great religious leaders do. They tell a story. Some elements of a good story:- We fight an evil force (think the Apple 1984 commercial against IBM. Think Buddha rejecting the caste system. Think Washington rejecting a third term because he didn't want the Presidency to turn into a monarchy).- We have something mysterious that nobody else has (a deity, better design philosophy, better technology, etc)- We think people will be happier if they work with us, subscribe to us, join us. Apple often has inferior products to other comparable products. But people are actually happier with an Apple product because the story is so strong.- Our leaders have ""seen the light"" or ""come out from the cold"". Steve Jobs had to leave his company for a decade in order to come back a hero. Buddha had to leave his home for seven years to achieve enlightenment. Mandela was in jail for decades.- Together we are better than apart. The bigger we are, the better we can help people who join us. So..if a company is buying lots of smaller companies, they need a vision that explains why bigger is better.For instance, we're able to help people faster because we understand the needs in every city in the world.- Social proof. A vision should have other stories within it. People your vision has helped. People whose lives became better. People who can stand up and say, ""this changed my life"".Bad corporate leaders will do this: buy all the companies, fire all the waste, report good numbers to the stock market, and then sell their stock, the stock goes down, the company falls apart.I've seen that happen a lot.F) BAD LEADERS DON'T WANT YOU TO CALL YOUR MOTHEREvery day, the people following a good leader should be able to call their parents and say, ""I'm so happy. You won't believe what I did/ learned/ met today.""G) BAD LEADERS TALK BADLY ABOUT THEIR CLIENTS OR EMPLOYEES OR CONSTITUENTSI was giving a talk at one company. It turns out they mostly hated their clients.I was surprised. How can you hate your clients? They are the ones who pay you money. They are the reason you come into work.If you hate what your clients' story is, how you can help them achieve their dreams?Leadership is not about achieving your dream. It's about helping everyone else achieve their dreams. This is NOT the employees' fault. Everything comes from the leaders. If the leader doesn't love the clients/constituents then the people below the leader and the people below them won't.Trickle-down leadership is the only leadership.H) BAD LEADERS DON'T WANT YOU TO PASS THEMI've had four mentors in my life. What do I mean by that?It means I wanted to be like them. I wanted my life path to mirror their's. I wanted to mimic their behavior and learn their knowledge so I could be as successful as them.I've had many more teachers than four. But maybe only four mentors.And here's what happened to each one of them: they all wanted me to fail at some point. That's a bad mentor.I learned what I could from them. I did everything they asked. I helped each one of them with their continual successes.But at some point, when I wanted to go on my own and learn more and start my own business or direction, they all were angry and they all tried to stop me and none of them talk to me anymore.In two cases, they actively tried to damage me even though I had never done anything but help them. It even gets worse but I don't want to put anyone down. I was aware of the dangers and went into it willingly.A good leader helps the people around them succeed past them. A great example is Stanford professor, Rajeev Motwani.What!? Who is he?Well, he was Sergey Brin's advisor. And instead of trying to keep Brin in a cage, he opened the cage and Brin flew out and started Google with fellow grad student Larry Page. Motwani became a billionaire as a result.Leadership doesn't ask the question ""How good can I get? How far can I get?""Leadership asks the question, ""How far can the people around me get?""People always say negative things about Steve Jobs, because of unfair media portrayals of him. But if Steve Jobs was such a bad person he wouldn't have been as great a leader as he is.People like Tim Cook, Jony Ive, John Lasseter (from Pixar) and many others (even Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney), Tony Fadell (developer of the ipod, who just sold Nest for $3.2 billion to Google) owe huge amounts of their success, their creativity, the distribution of their creativity, and their freedom and well-being, to the fact that at one point or other they were mentored by Steve Jobs or benefited from leadership decisions made by Steve Jobs.All of these people were very self-motivated, which is how they found themselves with someone like Steve Jobs as a mentor.But combine that self-motivation with the leadership skills of Steve Jobs and you end up with great success.The same thing happened at Google with the leadership skills of Larry Page.The CEOs or COOs of Twitter, Facebook, AOL, and Yahoo all were at one point mentees of Larry Page and are now successful leaders and mentors themselves.I) BAD LEADERS DON'T KNOW THEIR NUMBERSI'm raising my hand. When I ran companies it took me a long time to realize what numbers I needed to know.For instance, when you run a company you need to know not only your revenues and earnings but also your revenues and earnings per employee, per customer, per square foot, etc.This applies whether you are the leader of a company, of a meetup group, of a country, of anything.What are the metrics you need to know to determine success?For instance, if you are the teacher of a class, come up with a list of things you hope your students achieve by the end of the class.Not all of them will achieve it. That's ok.List each student. Next to each student's name, list all of the things you want them to achieve. At the beginning of the class, list each item for each student on a scale of 1-10.Add up all the numbers for all students so you have one final number. This is the number you are starting with.By the time the class is over, that number should be higher. It might mean just one student succeeded greatly. That's ok. Then you were a good leader.If you are having a hard time coming up with the right metrics, just use these: competence, relationships, autonomy. Help each person get better at those three things.By the way, it's important to have metrics. I visited a company recently that I felt had a bad vision for their customers. But even a bad vision is better than no vision. J) BAD LEADERS DON'T GET RID OF BAD PEOPLEI was involved with a company once that had a weak leader. He owed his leadership to the largest shareholder of the company.The problem is: the largest shareholder of the company was hideously corrupt. The good leader should have disassociated himself from the large shareholder, built a vision around his own leadership.Instead, he became mired in the financial difficulties of the largest shareholder, was unable to unify the divisions underneath him and provide effective mentorship to the people who directly worked for him.The company fell apart a year after he took over as CEO. Bad leadership, no matter what the situation, can cause almost instantaneous collapse. The 2008 failures of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers are great examples.When Bear Stearns stock price was falling from $80 to $2 within the space of a week, the CEO was off playing in a bridge tournament. Bridge is a card game.While he was playing cards, thousands of employees lost their jobs. And the downfall of Bear Stearns triggered the dominos that ultimately led to the multi trilion dollar bailouts of all banks and insurance firms that happened over the next ten months after the fall of Bear Stearns.Ultimately, the person who had installed him to be leader of Bear Stearns should've removed him or recognized his own character defects.Here's the problem with that and I'll mention it in the next point.K) A BAD LEADER OFTEN HAS ENORMOUS CHARISMAHow can someone who is a bad leader reach a leadership position?Easy. They have charisma. They are insanely smart and know how to charm the leaders who came before them.A great example might be the set of a movie production. The director is the leader. But he has a big problem. Actors are hired because of their enormous (ENORMOUS) charisma. The world loves them. So when they want something, it's hard to say ""no"" to them. A good director has to fight the urge to succumb to the charisma of the people he is leading and stay focused on the vision.For instance, in the case of Bear Stearns, the intoxication happened the instant the original leader, Alan Greenberg, met the new guy.Jim Cayne, the new guy, was a professional bridge player. In fact, that's all he was. To play bridge well (to play any professional-level game well) you need years of study, you need to be able to read people very well, you need to know numbers very well and to calculate many situations in your head quickly.Alan Greenberg loved bridge also. But he wasn't that good at it. So Jim Cayne used bridge to charm him. Many good leaders are successful game players include Bill Gates (bridge), Warren Buffett (bridge), Peter Thiel (chess), and numerous others. Jim Cayne was able to use this to his advantage. Alan Greenberg was an aspiring bridge player. When he met Jim Cayne he asked Jim, ""How good are you?"" and Jim said, ""if you played me for 100 years you will never be able to beat me."" That began the road to success for Cayne and then the entire collapse of the American economy.L) BAD LEADERS SMOKE CRACKI don't mean literally. Although if they smoked real crack they probably will never get to a real leadership position.There's a cognitive bias that causes people to not see their own failings. They've spent so much time, effort, and money creating their particular vision that they have ""investment bias"" that prevents their brains from saying, ""maybe i've made a mistake"".A bad leader will not admit his faults or even think about them. It's too painful to think about those faults because of this cognitive bias. One time I was starting a company at the same as a friend of mine. I knew instantly his company was bad but, perhaps I was not a good enough friend, I didn't tell him his idea was bad.Instead I would question him: who are the users? Who are the customers? How will you make money?I wanted him to see for himself through my questions that his idea was bad.But because I was asking these questions it sort of ""woke me up"". Every day I would ask myself the same questions about my own company. Every day I would call my partners and ask them, ""am I smoking crack"" and I would go over the questions with them.This process forced me to outline new features every day that could help me provide better services to my customers.I sold my business eight months to the day after I started it for $10,000,000.My friend's business: nine years later he's still pushing it. It has zero revenues.You have to step outside yourself and do due diligence on your own organization as if you were an outsider. Come up in advance, all of the metrics of success. Decide if those are the correct metrics.You have to assume you are smoking crack because often you will be. You can't help it. We're all human. So get help from others in your organization. Get help from customers. Get help from people outside the organization.They won't always be right either. And sometimes they will lie to you just to avoid being hurtful to your dreams (just like I was with my friend).The only person who can ultimately prevent you from smoking crack is you. This separates the good leaders from the bad leaders in many cases.M) BAD LEADERS WERE BAD EMPLOYEESLeadership starts long before you reach the top of an organization or community. At any point in your career, you are either a thermostat or a thermometer (hat tip to Jim Kwik who told me that metaphor). You either define the temperature of the people around you and help them to achieve their goals and dreams, or you simply do as you're told and be a follower and never inspire. How do you become the thermostat? - Every day, 1% improvement on yourself in the areas of physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. This 1% compounds very very quickly. - Every day, do something to help the people around you achieve greater competence, better relationships, and more freedom in their choices. - Repeat this: help others, then give them full credit. Whether it's your boss or your colleagues or your friends or family or whoever. Bad employees and leaders do the opposite of the above. But leadership starts at the bottom, does these three things, and floats to the top.",2015-05-28T04:10:05.000Z
The Power of Art,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/power-art-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,5351,369,60,2015-05-27 00:00:00,9.0,"""We were assigned this weird project,"" Mollie said. I was trying to fall asleep on the couch but my 13 year old kept staring at me until I said, ""what's up?"" and then she said that. ""What's it on?""""We have to write an essay that starts with the words 'The Power of...' ""Of course I thought she was going to write about 'The Power of No' and I would tell her, ""aww, you didn't have to do that just because I wrote the book and I'm your father.""""So what did you write on?""""Well, everyone was writing stuff like the 'Power of Kindness' and things that seemed kind of boring. So I wrote about the 'Power of Art'.""""I like that. How come?""""Well, with art, you have to deal with perfection. Nobody is perfect. For everyone who loves singing, there is always someone who sings better. For everyone who draws, there is always someone who draws better. You can't make art if you are trying to be perfect.""She was using her hands to express herself and was getting excited. There was a lot of noise outside because it was Memorial Day and the cannons from West Point were firing. But I was listening closely.""And sometimes things are hard to say. And art gives you like a different language to say and explain things.""I liked this.""So,"" I said, ""Art is both on the outside: with pictures and singing and dancing and so on, but also on the inside, as another way to say what's inside of you.""""Yeah,"" she said,""but if you do it because you want people to like you then you're always going to have disappointment. You can only create art if you love the art itself. And it's not just art but maybe everything.""So I think I learned something from my 13 year old today. Originally I was just going to plagiarize her and write this but decided to give her full credit. ""You know why we wrote 'The Power of No'?"" I asked her.

The One Moment It All Happened,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/one-moment-all-happened-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,11624,317,44,2015-05-26 00:00:00,9.0,"I was sick of it. Another day in suck city, daytrading. It wasn't so long ago. But now it was forever ago. I always was fooled into thinking I was smart enough to daytrade.But I hated it. And that day I had lost a lot of money.Where had it gone? Why was I doing the only job in the world where you can lose money instead of get money?Claudia said to me, ""what's wrong?"" But I couldn't look up. I felt it in my stomach, in my chest, in my head, I couldn't move.The sunlight was scattering through the branches outside, falling like stains on the table while she sat there and I didn't know what to say.""Let's go,"" I said.""Where?"" We had just moved into town. 65 miles away from the city so I could be closer to my kids.""Follow me,"" I said.And we left the house and walked about a mile and came to a small island. We walked over the bridge.""Where are we going?"" she said and I walked us through the paths until we came to the other side of the island, the part facing the Hudson River.There was a small beach there. I had been there before but Claudia hadn't. She thought I was crazy.For some reason everyone on the beach was Hispanic. There in the middle of the day. Why?Everyone was speaking Spanish. I didn't understand anything.""What are you doing?"" Claudia said and I walked into the water and started swimming.There was a boat anchored about 50 feet away. I could swim to it but I didn't. Instead I swum out far enough where I could sink and put my head under the water.She came in the water also, but just to the point where she could wade and feel the coolness on the lower part of her body and the heat on her face. The day was split in half like that. Just like the sun was about to set.I went under, with my clothes mostly on and I floated for a bit. I couldn't take it anymore.I had just moved. I had just gotten married. I was still losing money. I didn't know what I was doing anymore.And I was just bleeding money and Claudia would realize what a fake I was and my and I would lose her also and then my kids would starve. Everyone would starve.""Honey?"" Claudia said. And I came out of the water.I pulled her in and she laughed and we floated for awhile and held each other. Other people from the beach, on a 5pm, came in and out of the water.The people on the boat watched all of us. Where was the boat going? Why were they out here on a Wednesday at 5pm?Were they rich, without a care in the world, and maybe they were just going up and down the Hudson River, never worried about anything in their lives.Were there people like that - people with no worries? What separated them from me?We were laughing. I hadn't been swimming in years. I had never gone into the water from a beach.I always thought it was disgusting. What would I step on? Jellyfish were the first beings to crawl from the sea to the land, eventually evolving into sexual creatures, eventually evolving into mammals, into men and women.Would I step on a jellyfish. Would it stick to me? Or seaweed? Or mud, pulling me back in, back to where the jellyfish first came from?When I was above the water I thought that love was everything. When I was floating under the water I closed my eyes and felt like wisdom was that feeling of ""nothing"" you only get when you float. Everything and the nothing.We walked home. Wet. The sun hot but cooling as the shadow of the mountain began to scrub out the sun for the day.I then wrote a blog post. About going broke. About being afraid of leaving my kids. About a crushing disappointment.About something I did that was very wrong. I had been writing for years but I was telling the truth - what a miserable failure I could be. And I was sick of pretending not to be.Someone tweeted - ""too much information"". So over the years I gave more information. And then how I started to bounce back. Again and again and again every time I bounced back using one technique.And now I needed to do it again. And this time I would make it stick. Please, I said to myself, make it stick!Or maybe that wasn't the time I went swimming. Maybe it was the time I couldn't sleep and I wrote up all my numbers and subtracted and added and divided until all that was let was an equation of my panic at three in the morning.And I kept writing numbers until I fell asleep at the table. And then the next day, sickened by myself, I wrote.I don't know which day it was. But I gave up. I didn't want to care anymore. I didn't want to wonder what people thought. I didn't want to care what happened to me.Since then my life has totally changed. I feel like I'm in a different universe now. I feel like I'm in a different body. That I have a different brain. I'm almost ashamed to say I'm happy. Or calm. One of them.I never know what will happen now. I never try to know. Today opens up like a mystery book. I give up. I surrender. It hurts to feel that panic. To feel that loneliness. To feel scared that everyone is going to realize what a fraud you are. I was scared.But I wrote. I went underwater and never came back. And this time it stuck.",2015-05-26T13:17:09.000Z

I was depressed. I was afraid I had let them down even before they were two years old. I regret the girl I left because I thought I was going to go broke and she wouldn't like me. I regret thinking I was smart and starting or investing in businesses that I knew nothing about. What do I do now? Smashing a coconut in the street because someone told me it would create good luck. Yes. I regret that. Sometimes I even regret writing or saying things that I didn't realize would hurt some people close to me. I'm sorry. But I said it and I believed it and you can't put toothpaste back into the tube. No war can be justified, college is a scam, home ownership is vile, voting is useless, jobs suck, my dad had horrific relationships as a kid that I was afraid I was doomed to repeat - are among a few of the issues that resulted in death threats or lost friends and lost family. A lion doesn't give it's prey a chance to explain before it eats the prey. But show me a regret and I will also show you something to be grateful for. We only grow by solving difficult gratitude problems. Literally: our brains neurons connect in new ways that save our lives later. We regret because we didn't question enough.

Mimi Makes A Million,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mimi-makes-million-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,425935,1998,524,2015-05-20 00:00:00,13.0,"I think I'm in love with Mimi Ikonn. Oh, and also her husband Alex Ikonn. Don't want to confuse anyone!When I was a kid I didn't think I would be happy unless I was a ""millionaire"". Some kids in my school said they were millionaires and they would make fun of anyone who wasn't.I asked my dad what he was worth. He said $2. Maybe that scarred me so much that I always make sure to have wads of $2 bills on me at all times.A year or so later his company went bankrupt. So he wasn't worth the same anymore. In his mind, he was worth ZERO.For the rest of his life he sat in the living room, depressed, and listened to music. When he was a little boy he loved music and won an award.At some point we all return to what we loved as a child. I suppose that means I will return to comics, Judy Blume, and spying on people.A few weeks ago I met Mimi Ikonn and Alex Ikonn. I was insanely curious about them.How come? Because Mimi makes videos of herself, delivers real value to people, and then makes over a million a year because of those videos.I don't know how old Mimi is. She's much younger than me. She's much younger than my father ever was when I was alive. He would've liked to live her life.So Claudia and I asked Mimi and Alex if we could interview them. Because they seemed very happy also. The podcast comes out later today but here's the summary. This is a simple post. How to make a million.I am absolutely sure the same techniques that worked for Mimi and Alex can work for anyone. I had them lay it out step by step. A) EMOTIONSMimi became obsessed with beauty and hair. She and Alex watched before and after videos of women who were getting hair extensions. ""They seemed much happier after getting extensions,"" Alex said. ""Whenever there are strong emotions about something you know there is an opportunity.""So Mimi started making videos of herself discussing hair and beauty and hair products.""I never thought I would get more than 1,000 views,"" Mimi said. ""But I loved doing the videos. And I wanted to share my love for the topics with as many people as possible.""Now she has had a quarter of a BILLION views on her videos with 2.7 million subscribers.B) HUB AND SPOKEPeople ask: ""How do I get traffic to my blog"". Or ""how do I get buyers of my book."" or ""How do I get people to follow me on Twitter.""A lot of it is about loneliness. We sit in our house writing blog posts and then hit Publish. We want family to love them. We want friends to love them. And then we want the world to love them.I'm really just talking about myself. I know when people enjoy things I do, I feel as if I have a family. I'm happy. At least until the next post.Mimi loved making the videos but needed traffic.So they did the only two-step technique that gets traffic online for anything you want to do. Well, make it a three-step technique.1) LoveKnow more, love more, express more, bleed more, than anyone else. Was Mimi the only one doing videos on beauty and hair? No. But maybe she put more passion into it.2) Spread the LoveAlex would take images and posts and links to her videos and spread them on Pinterest, Instagram, blogs, other sites and have them all point back to her YouTube channel.I call this ""the Hub and Spoke"" approach. Youtube was the hub, with a dozen or so spokes reaching out to popular sites that all would link back to the hub.3) Make more LoveNo matter what you do - some will be good and some will be bad. Not every video or post is going to have views. So you do more.When you do more, several things happen:a. More people find you.b. You rank higher on searchc. You improved. People who find you start clicking on your older videos so now they start to get more views.The ""Make More Love"" technique always works. Michelle Phan did 54 YouTube videos before she made a massive hit. Hugh Howey had already ten novels before he published ""Wool"" which became a massive bestseller. Clayton Christiansen applied for NASA for 18 years in a row before they accepted him.Make more love.C) 1000 PEOPLENote she said she only thought she was going to get 1000 viewers. The number 1000 keeps coming up with people who have HUGE audiences.Kevin Kelly wrote about this in a great post called ""1000 True Fans"". He writes about it kk.org. He also talks about it on my podcast.Tim Ferriss talks about how every one of his posts he makes sure he's going to deliver value to at least 1000 people. Of course he delivers much more value than that. But 1000 seems to be the right number that people who know seem to focus on.Keep focusing on delivering value for a 1000 and then they tell 2 friends and so on and next thing you know you have a quarter of a billion views, five bestsellers, movies being made about you, you go into space, your own makeup lines, and on and on and on, depending on what it is you love.D) BUY LOW, SELL HIGHAlex and Mimi noticed that many of the other beauty videos were talking about a specific brand of hair extensions for women. So they went to my favorite place in the world - the mall.""We saw these products were priced at $500,"" Alex said. ""So then we went on Ali Baba and saw the same products being sold for $100. We then went to the manufacturers and saw we could buy directly for $50. The exact same products that were being sold for $500.""They borrowed from mom. Borrowed their full amount off of their credit cards. And they placed an order. Then, I imagine (they did not tell me this) they prayed.E) SOFT SELLMimi talks about many products on her videos. She expressed a radiant, confident personality and talks about everything she is wearing, what her habits are, what products she uses. She NEVER sells anything.But underneath the video is just a link. www.luxyhair.com.The orders came in one at a time. Then 100 at a time. They sold out of their inventory, paid everyone back, and bought more.In their very first year (2010) they had over a million in revenues. Ever since then they've had more than a million a year in profits. Never once using the words ""buy this"" anywhere.F) QVC-AThe most successful people have a model for their success. I think that's why I enjoy Peter Thiel's ""Zero to One"" book so much. Or Peter Diamandis's ""Bold"". Or Marcus Lemonis's TV show ""The Profit"".Each book has a different, but very very simple, model for how to achieve success or how to judge which companies are successful.Mimi and Alex developed their own model, they stick with it, and have used this simple model to keep jumping from success to success.Alex explained it to me:Q - QualityEverything they do is quality. The cameras they use for videos (""But not overdoing it, because this is YouTube and not television,"" said Mimi). The setting they use and how it fits their message.The products, etcV - ValueMimi is not trying to sell anything in her videos. She explains what she does and how she does it. She does the research and believes in the products. Rather than asking, she is giving. ""When you give a billion dollars in value,"" Alex said, ""you get a billion dollars or more back.""C - ConsistencyI read a book about television once by TV mega-executive Grant Tinker. He was Mary Tyler Moore's husband, ran NBC for awhile, and then ran MTM productions producing such shows as ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", ""Bon Newhart"", and a dozen other super hit TV shows.I only remember one thing in the book. He said, ""whenever they changed the time or date of a show, then that show would die. If you moved a show from Tuesday at 8pm to Thursday at 8:30pm then you just lost your whole audience.""Mimi said, ""if you are going to put out a video once a week, put it out once a week. Put it out the same day each week if you can. Don't do once a month. Don't do random. Your audience starts to anticipate and look forward to your shows and knows when to expect them.""A- AuthenticityMimi only talks on the videos about what she believes in. There's no fluff. There's no pitch. She's exuberant and it shows on each video.H) LESSMimi and Alex were working 80-100 hour weeks. They had the money in the bank. They had achieved their goals. They loved what they were doing but when you hit a lifelong goal you start to ask, ""is that it?""They got depressed. Goals are a myth. Our ancestors for 200,000 years didn't have goals. Every day started from scratch: hunt, forage, eat, sex, sleep, wake up to a new day.Then we were told to find our ""goals"". And now everyone asks, ""I'm 17 years old and feel like I've accomplished nothing in life. What should I do?""Learning to find happiness with less is true wealth. Claudia and I recently got rid of most of our belongings, for instance. Then we started cancelling most meetings that I had set up. Sometimes it was hard. I had agreed to an event and then I would cancel.Ultimately we are the sum of our experiences and not the sum of our belongings. There is nothing wrong with making money but it is only one small part of living a life of comfort, of compassion, of calm.Mimi and Alex started to focus more on the other things that were important in their lives. ""And you know what happened?"" Alex said. ""The more we did that, the more money we made.""",2015-05-20T15:52:42.000Z

Even I am not that bad a driver. I've only almost killed one person. Maybe two.Pierre tried to get ahead of the Aston Martin in front of his Mercedes, made a sharp turn, flew into a wall, exploded, pieces flying everywhere, his skull crushed on impact, a fire and pieces of cars blew into the audience, and 88 people died.The worst accident in a race in history.It was Pierre's sixth race.What's the biggest difference between a professional race car driver who has put in his 10,000 hours of deliberate practice and one who has put in ""just "" 1000 hours?I asked a friend of mine. He said, ""reflexes"".Wrong answer.Both drivers pretty much have the same reflexes.The answer is the rear view mirror. The driver who has put in his 10,000 hours has his rear view mirror adjusted just a few millimeters different from the guy who has ""just"" raced professionally for 1,000 hours.How come? Because the more advanced driver is interested in one thing: PREVENTING A HAZARDOUS MISTAKE. Both have the same reflexes. Both will make the same turns. But the one who checks for more hazards - will win.If you want to shortcut the 10,000 hours, you check for hazards. You check for more things that can go wrong. Then you will get better faster.And you will live. You will stay in the race. Many people think great entrepreneurs take risks. Great entrepreneurs mitigate risks. I'm divorced and re-married.

What I Learned About Leadership When I...,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-i-learned-leadership-when-interviewed-biggest-drug-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,144426,1653,380,2015-05-18 00:00:00,12.0,"We want you to come out here and interview ""Freeway Rick Ross"" on stage.Who?I was talking to Jayson Gaignard. I don't really know anything about anything so Jayson had to explain and then I looked up Rick. And then I got obsessed.Rick Ross had sold about a billion dollars worth of crack cocaine during his ""career"". I read every book. I read his autobiography. I read about a dozen articles. I watched three documentaries.I flew out to Jayson's Mastermind Talks in Napa Valley. Seth Godin has great advice about speaking at conferences: If you speak at a conference either do it for free because you love it, or charge FULL RETAIL. I flew out to Jayson's conference for free. I was really nervous because I knew I had nothing at all in common with Rick. Maybe he would hate me. Some nerdy Jewish guy who thinks he knows everything. I had written down about 100 questions but I knew I wouldn't look at my notes during the interview. I then rewrote them from memory. And then rewrote them again. I knew the questions I rewrote the most were the ones that were probably most interesting to me. There were many things I didn't care much about: politics, legal issues, the Iran-Contra situation (Rick was fooled by the CIA into providing drug profits to the Contras).The rise of gang violence was an issue so before the interview I had lunch with Rick and asked about that. He told me that while he was there, everyone working for one cause: making money, and they knew that if homicide police came in then that would be the end of the money.""There was less gang violence when I was in charge,"" he said, ""because we were all getting rich"". We had a great interview that lasted an hour and the result will be on my podcast within the next few weeks.Rick Ross's most active years were from 1981-1988. Basically a billion dollars worth of crack went through his organization. His connection was from Nicaragua. His distribution were all the gangs that he grew up with in South Central LA. His family broke up when he was four. He grew up amidst non-stop violence. He watched his uncle kill his aunt. Gang violence was every day. He didn't learn to read or write so when he was 18 he was kicked out of high school and kicked off the tennis team where he was an aspiring champion. That was his one chance, he felt, to get out of the ghetto. He was on the street and needed to make money without an education, a family, and the ability to read or write. He asked an ex high school teacher for advice on how he could make money. The teacher suggested he sell drugs. So he sold drugs. And instead of spending his profits, Rick kept doubling and doubling until all the other dealers were now buying from him and Rick was using his scale to drive his own costs down.Eventually he was the main connection in all of the United States, buying up to $5 million worth of cocaine A DAY.The podcast will have the guts of the interview. But I was impressed how soft-spoken, ready to answer, and humble Rick was. He had spent, in various periods, close to 20 years in jail. Now his main goal was to lecture kids in jail and school how to avoid the situation he was in.Here's what I gather were his main rules on leadership. How to lead a billion dollar organization where many of the people below him (""all of them"", Rick said and the crowd we were in front of laughed) carried guns.A) TRY TO GET THE PEOPLE WORKING FOR YOU TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN YOU""I wanted the same for them and for them to even surpass me.""They might not always take it. But give them the chance to be as successful as you and they will take that example to the people below them. B) HONESTYThis sounds strange coming from a drug kingpin but there aren't any lawyers or courts to track down liars. Honesty is the law in that game.When there are lawyers, people lie and deceive and betray. When everything is based on your word and everyone is carrying guns, honesty is the rule. ""If there was any funny business, I'd rather not deal with them anymore, or be very careful with them in the future.""C) BE VERY LOW KEYNobody ever saw Rick being flashy. He was so low key that even when he was running almost a half billion dollars a year, the police had no idea what he looked like.Part of this was a decentralized structure. People several layers below him in the organization would not have any contact with him and would have to deal with conflicts at their level.""I had to show by example how to manage, so the people underneath me would know what to do instead of me being always involved."" D) ONLY DO THE ESSENTIALRick arranged the top level contacts between his sellers and his buyers. Then he stepped back.Everything else had to be dealt with by the people who worked for him and the people who worked for them.""Everyone knew what they had to do."" And if they didn't, they stopped being part of the food chain. E) DON'T MAKE IT ABOUT THE MONEYAgain: odd advice from a mega drug lord. Rick poured many of his profits back into his neighborhood.This was in part to give back, to contribute. But at the same time, it was strategic.When he went to jail at one point and his bail was set at over a million dollars the million had to come from legitimate enterprises. So Rick could not supply his own bail.Instead, every household on the block he grew up on, put up their own homes as bail in order to get Rick out of jail.When you make it not about the money the benefits never stop since money is only a tiny byproduct of the reasons we live, we do things, we strive for success.F) REDUCE CONFRONTATIONSWhen things have the possibility of getting incredibly violent, reduce confrontation as quickly as possible.Often Rick would simply pay off or write off any losses on people who were no longer fitting in with the organization, rather than have a confrontation with them. Violence could bring in a whole new set of problems. Better to take a loss and move on and now worry about it. G) FREEMIUMIt's almost a cliche, but Rick told how he went to Cincinnati. Stayed with a friend and told him to invite ten of his friends over. Then when everyone was there he gave everyone a free supply and told them if they were interested to come back in a week and buy the next batch. Everyone came back. Sometimes the sooner you charge in a business, the quicker you put a ceiling on your potential for expansion. This is true whether your business is drugs or when Facebook was waiting to charge for ads. H) ASSUME THE WORST""I always knew I was going to go to jail,"" Rick said. But he wasn't going to sit around and wait for it to happen. He owned over a dozen houses so nobody knew where he was. He barricaded the houses to with multiple iron fences so that it would take the police over an hour to smash their way in and by then everyone would be gone. He would leave town for months at a time. He would put extra profits into ""legitimate"" businesses like a car parts company and hotels. He always assumed the worst, so that's how he was able to diversify all the potential ways he could succeed.",2015-05-18T12:26:05.000Z

William Zinsser, author of ""On Writing Well"" died yesterday. He was 92 years old. Was his book any good. I don't know. It sold 1.5 million copies. His students and readers are practically every non-fiction writer I look up to.Stephen Dubner, who wrote Freakonomics, first recommended him to me. I've always hated books like Strunk &amp; White's Elements of Style but I was looking for a good book on writing nonfiction and Stephen recommended Zinsser's book. Other great books that have been recommended to me by authors: ""On Writing"" by Stephen King, Zen and the Art of Writing by Ray Bradbury, and ""Bird by Bird"" by Anne Lamott although both Tucker Max and Claudia Azula Altucher violently disagree with me on the last one. I happen to love the book and stand by it. What did Zinsser say? Why did everyone love and buy and emulate the principles in his book. You decide. Here is some of his top advice: GET RID OF CLUTTER""Look for the clutter in your writing and prune it ruthlessly. Be grateful for everything you can throw away. Re-examine each sentence you put on paper. Is every word doing new work? Can any thought be expressed with more economy? Is anything pompous or pretentious or faddish? Are you hanging on to something useless just because you think it's beautiful? Simplify, simplify.""WRITE FOR YOURSELF, NOT OTHERS""You are writing primarily to please yourself, and if you go about it with enjoyment you will also entertain the readers who are worth writing for.""STUDY THE GREATS - BUT ALSO YOUR CONTEMPORARIES""Writing is learned by imitation. If anyone asked me how I learned to write, I'd say I learned by reading the men and women who were doing the kind of writing I wanted to do and trying to figure out how they did it.""THINK OF WRITING AS A PROCESS, NOT A PRODUCTMany authors ""know what they want to write, but instead of writing they say 'Well, my main problem is figuring out how to find an agent and get it published. I tell them, 'The main problem is that you need to write the damn thing.'""READ EVERYTHING YOU WRITE OUT LOUD FOR RHYTHM AND SOUND""Good writers of prose must be part poet, always listening to what they write.""HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF AS A WRITER""I go around giving my students permission to be who they are, and there aren't enough people doing that,"" he said. ""You learn to write by believing in who you are.""",2015-05-14T13:21:19.000Z

What Does Your Map Look Like Today?,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-does-your-map-look-like-today-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,4299,294,51,2015-05-12 00:00:00,8.0,"I remember my dad lighting the water rocket and it flew into the sky and all the kids in the neighborhood thought I was the coolest kid.I remember getting off the train a few years ago when my daughter (now a teenager) was little and I took five photos of her running closer and closer to me: smiling, laughing, ready to be picked up and swung around.Now that little girl has disappeared into the body of a teenager and I will never see her again.I tried to find the photos. To remember that little girl. But I can't find them. Gone.Between those two moments is sandwiched me, squeezed into the blueprint of an adult along the way.Crushed by time and the drudgery of worries, of responsibilities, of eventual death (father), of eventual change (teenage daughter), of aging (me), of the constant struggle (when will they call back, the crushing fear of loss, when will they want me, how can I best choose myself when the world constantly wants to have the first choice). Nobody gives us the map. We have to draw it ourselves. With crayons preferably. Change it every day preferably.But where do we begin? Nobody tells us.Our GPS will constantly reroute and nobody told us that is ok. It's normal GPS behavior.Nobody will tell us that along the way there are many nice places. Stop and enjoy the tea and look around at the beauty, and meet new people.Exchange new ideas, and maybe stop for awhile and learn, but then eventually we have to say goodbye and continue on that journey again. But when?Nobody tells us how important it is to celebrate the moments where we reach a new destination on the map. To cherish the people we meet who are on the same journey.To help the people who are struggling right behind us but have their hands out, ready to be helped. These are our people.Nobody tells us that when we stare out the window and daydream while the adult brainwasher drones on that those moments are the highlights on the map.I don't care about any war. I don't care about whether or not the sun revolves around the Earth or whether the Earth is flat or what religion is right or wrong. Or who is President.I'm grateful for two things.When I was a little boy I did two bad things. I would bite my hand all night and had developed a bump all around my fingers created by my teeth. The doctor didn't know how to get me to stop.My grandmother bought me superhero dolls. In the middle of the night she would take my hands out of my mouth and have me hold the dolls. So I stopped biting my fingers.I also wet the bed every night. I would wake up soaked every day.My grandmother would come into the room and wake me up around 2 or 3 in the morning so I could go to the bathroom. Gradually I stopped wetting the bed.It's hard to save the world. It's easy to think of five or ten little things you can do today to help someone's life completely change. Give them something to celebrate. Make their lives a little happier. Even a single laugh is rapture for the body.Five or ten things to help them make their map a little more clear. Their journey a little easier.Everyone wants purpose, or to make the entire world cooler, or to create a virtual reality, or to lead the planet. Everyone wants to find their rocketship to take them into the universe.We didn't know if it would work. My dad said, ""everyone run"" and then the rocket took off and flew all across our backyards and I was happy and proud and only much later would I find things that would crash me down.And much later I would lift my daughter up and swing her around while we both laughed.Both of those moments are gone and I know I didn't appreciate them enough. I miss my five year old. And I miss me being five years old.That's ok. I have today, and the map spread out before me, with coffee stains and creases, and words I can't understand, and places that have no roads, and places I may one day go.",2015-05-12T14:51:08.000Z
How Do I Know If I Should Take A Job At A Startup?,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-do-i-know-should-take-job-startup-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,39620,642,102,2015-05-11 00:00:00,11.0,"Imagine if someone asked ""would you invest in this company?"" Your answer is going to be similar. With a few additions.Here's the checklist I would follow:A) Has the CEO built a business before.This is not always reliable (Mark Zuckerberg or Larry Page hadn't built businesses before) but there's an interesting stat:85% of startups fail. If the CEO has built and sold a startup before then the odds go down to 25%. So you might as well have the statistics on your side. B) Does the company have good funding? By good funding I mean two things:a. Enough money to last at least a year. And, by the way, this is an important thing to note: if the company has six months or less worth of funding THEN THEY ARE ALREADY OUT OF BUSINESS. Which is why ""A"" above is so important. Good CEOs know this. b. ""Good funding"" means people (or funds) who will also write second checks. If all they have is one year's worth of friends and family money then you are taking the risk in a year they will run out of money. Why take risks when there are plenty of other good jobs out there. And, I'll throw in a bonus third thing on this: it shows they are the type of company / CEO who can raise money, sell his vision, etc. C) Do you believe in the vision? This can mean several things. a) The CEO is creative enough to develop a strong vision and he's also a good enough communicator to convey that vision. b) You would use the product (if the product was applicable to you)c) You can't use the product but you can easily see how this product can help a million or more people. I'll give a good example and a bad example. Good example: Tesla. You would work for Tesla if you believe in Elon Musk's vision of reduced need on fossil fuels, or if you want to drive a Tesla, or if you think if everyone driving an electronic car (and having a powerwall) will help a million or more people. Bad example: someone pitched me an idea where consumers can pick the type of ads they see. I do NOT see how this would really help a million or more people. So I would not work for a company like that (and, by the way, they had a lot of investors). I invested in a startup recently that developed a technology for vaping vitamins and medical drugs. I USE the product (I vape B12 with it, Vitamin D with it, and trans-reservatrol). And I can easily see how this can help a million or more people (the entire US is Vitamin D deficient and people's bodies are unable to digest vitamin pills. (Btw, not trying to get anyone interested in this - already fully funded). D) ValuationYou're presumably getting options at a startup and, depending on the value you contribute, those options will increase. How do you know if their latest round valuation is good?Forget for a second the money they raised (we dealt with that above). But imagine you had, in cash, the amount of their full valuation. Would you be able to create a better product with more traction? Like, for $46 billion, would you be able to beat Uber? Unclear to me. But there are plenty of startups out there where if you gave me their full valuation in cash I can easily see how they can be replaced. Don't work for a company that is easily replaceable at a lower valuation. #2 consideration. If you believe in the valuation, make sure your options are not at the venture capital price but at the ""409A valuation"" price. Google that. E) LearningThere's a great story about Sergey Brin interviewing people. He can usually tell in the first few minutes if he's not going to hire someone. So then he spends the rest of the interview making sure he learns at least one thing from the interviewee. Make sure that even in the worst case scenario where you misjudged everything else, that you at least learn one thing fairly quickly after you take the job so that it adds to your skillset and you can move on to get a better job. I took a job once at HBO (not a startup but still) where I learned so much in a three year period I was able to take the skills (ranging from technology to entertainment to TV production) that I was able to leave and start a successful company. F) SubtletiesI visit a lot of companies per year for various reasons. I always look for the subtleties. a. how do the partners get a long. For instance, one company I was about to invest in was a co-CEO situation. I heard one of the CEOs gossiping about the other. I didn't invest. The entire culture of a company comes from the top down. So if the partners who started the business don't have their emotional act together, the company itself won't be emotionally sound. b. how do the employees talk about the clients. Read the biography of the founder of JetBlue. He would stay up to 3 in the morning every night responding to customer service emails. Once a month he would ride on one of the longer plane rides and starting at the back of the plane and moving to the front he would sit with every passenger and ask them if they had any problems with the flight. He actually hired employees that way. That's the CEO but everyone in the company should have that attitude towards customers. A year ago I visited a law firm where they were trashing their customers and making jokes about it. That's not the sort of company I would hire, work for, invest in, etc. A company and it's customers are ONE eco-system. Not ""us vs them"". c. your boss and his/her boss. A lot of bosses make hiring decisions based on ""would you ride in a cross-country airplane next to this guy"". You should make your decision the same way about your potential bosses. Believe me - they need you more than you need them. So you have to like them. Also, think ecosystem again - try to see their relationships with other people in the company. All gossiping is bad. Hopefully they think highly of the people they work with. Else you shouldn't work for them and you shouldn't work for that company. G) Demographic TrendsWarren Buffett is not a value investor. Everyone thinks he is but he hasn't done real value investing since the early 1960s. Warren Buffett is a demographic investor. Two quotes from Buffett: ""If a company is going to be here 20 years from now then it is probably a good stock to buy"". and""If you have a strong demographic wind behind you then the company will do well even with poor management"". Example: the book, ""Bold"" lists a lot of demographic trends that take advantage of Moore's Law that are getting bigger. Robotics, Internet of Things, 3D Printing, etc. That's one start. Another start are companies disrupting healthcare since that is such a mess right now. Another example: I'd rather work for Uber than a company that lends money against taxi medallions. I'd rather work for AirBnB than Marriott. I'd rather work for Tesla than GM. H) Light At the End of the TunnelYou can't ask in your interview, ""when will you IPO?"" It's unpredictable when a company will ""exit"" (i.e. get sold or IPO or have some event which allows employees to sell some of their shares). A good company might wait 7-10 years before an exit. In fact, a good company SHOULD wait 7-10 years. How come? Because if they are good then they are undoubtedly growing faster than the market. So they should stay private as long as possible to maximize benefits for shareholders / employees. Here's the problem. The average employee stays at a startup for 3.1 years (perhaps that corresponds to vesting schedules, I don't know). Make sure you can wait for that 7-10 year run. Also, I'd try to figure out if management is ultimately interested in an exit. Some CEOs are not. I) Eventual ProfitsMake sure you see the path to profitability. Some startups might be years away. But the good thing about working for a company that ultimately has huge margins (not just profits but margins) is that they have a lot of perks. Just compare the chef at Google with the chef at Walmart. Hint: there IS NO chef at Walmart.",2015-05-11T14:45:45.000Z

Years later I was calling new clients in a new business and helping them solve their divorce issues. And years after that I was pretending to be best friends with people who then fired me, didn't pay me, and never talked to me again (until they needed me again - and then they offered me a job I refused). I was always stuck because I was pretending to be someone I wasn't in order to get something I ultimately lost. My integrity and my self worth and my net worth were all connected and I didn't know it. That's why I would lose everything. Until: Me. You. Us. Me: I chose myself. Physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. I don't need to write about those anymore. You can read past posts (or maybe my next one. Who knows?)You: Then I needed a second layer.

I cut off all ties with people. I stopped talking to everyone.I didn't have a job. My kids didn't know anyone. I had nothing to do. And it was snowing all the time, at least in my memories.But then something happened. A couple of people moved into town and brought a Scrabble set with them every morning to the cafe. We all started to get there at 6 in the morning so we could play Scrabble. Soon there were two games going. We all became friends. Sometimes if two of us were hanging out in the afternoon we'd take walks. We'd eat lunch. We had more coffee. We talked to each other about our problems. Even in the worst, most embarrassing, horrifying moments, we would share what was going on. I can't believe the things I shared. The things she shared. He shared. They shared. Horrific things. A friend listens. A friend is curious.A friend doesn't judge. A friend offers suggestions but doesn't force their solutions. I'm not ashamed to ask for help from a friend. I'm pretty much ashamed to ask for help from anyone else. Sometimes I meet a new person and BAM! Magic! We don't need to be friends for 40 years. We can't stop talking. Our chemistry is friends. Sometimes I really like people but I can also sense, ""I can never really be friends with them"". Eventually they drift away. That's ok also.When I see a friend, sometimes I can't wait to talk and update and...but I already know. When I feel that rush in my chest its my body's way of saying, ""there's a friend!"" I miss my friends that I haven't seen in a long time. But I have some friends where we pick right up even if we haven't seen each other in years. And I have other friends I know I will never see again. That's ok. I love the fact that we were once friends. Friends don't expect a lot from me and I don't expect a lot from them. Then... guess what? Our expectations are always exceeded. 100%Friends introduce me to other friends they think I will like. I do the same. I think my friends will like each other. Friends share ideas with me and I share ideas with them. I have idea sex with friends and we grow idea families together. Our little babies. We watch the babies grow. It takes a village to grow ideas.Friends make me laugh and I make them laugh right back. And when one of us cries, the other tries to listen. Sometimes we laugh even though neither of us made sense. We don't dwell on our non-friends. They don't exist.You don't wait once a year for a big friendship party. For me, it's important to have friendship ""celebrations"" as much as possible. Little ones. Maybe every day. A river of friendship instead of a rare lightning storm.Friends help me get better at things. Friends point out when they think I'm wrong but know I probably won't listen. Friends help me make decisions that give me more freedom in life. Freedom to have more time to be friends! Too many people wonder ""What's my goal!"" Too many times I've said, ""I can't be happy without X or Y!"" Too many times there are awards and slights and goals and ideals and dreams. All of those disappear. My memories of friendship never disappear. For the past ten years I've had more friends each year that the year before. I'm celebrating that today. And maybe I will tomorrow also. Sometimes I miss friends I haven't seen in a long time. Don't worry. Even if we never see each other again... we saw each other once.",2015-05-07T04:15:57.000Z

I worked for my favorite entertainment company in the world. I would've paid to work there. I made friends at work. And on weekends we'd even get together and play poker. Sometimes we'd even travel on vacations together. My boss would yell at me but I could ignore him. So I forgive you.I loved the work I was doing. What could be better than being paid to interview prostitutes and drug dealers at three in the morning in the sleaziest most dangerous parts of New York City. I was chased once with a knife. I once had a bottle thrown at me. I had guards at transvestite clubs chase me. And I had a lot of fun! All for money. I will tell you what is better than that, because I can't be so arrogant to think that nothing is better than that. Walking on the moon is better than that. And maybe being a clown in a large circus. Or a famous street magician. But not much else. I always write about ""ten reasons to quit your job"". Of course I still believe that. You should quit your job. But maybe not today. Not everything is black and white. For instance, when I daytraded for a living, many years later, there were some days when I would go to work and LOSE money. WHOAH! Sometimes in the morning I was so afraid to lose more money I'd go to the Catholic Church across the street and pray to Jesus that Nasdaq futures would go up in the morning. I'm Jewish so it never worked. That never happens at a job. At a job you go into work and they send you a check every two weeks. That's real magic. A lot of times people think the alternative of a job is to be an entrepreneur. That's not true either. An entrepreneur is someone who has a job, but it's a job he made up all by himself. He woke up one day and said, ""I'm going to make an app to connect all left-handed people on a dating site."" And then he raised money, hired people, made an app, tried to sell the app. An entrepreneur has a job also. But here's the difference. In a regular job you can probably get by (maybe unhappily but still get by) forever. But an entrepreneur has a job where there's a well known 85% chance rate of failure. Which would you rather take? I don't want people to stay at a job. But here's several good things about having a job. We can't ignore them. Here's several things to think about it. And I finish with the alternative.

How To Be Mentally Strong,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-mentally-strong-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,46349,1647,332,2015-05-05 00:00:00,11.0,"When I was a kid I used to skip school, hide behind my house until my parents left, and then go off to play chess with John Nash. Not THE John Nash, the Nobel Prize winner who also had schizophrenia. But his son, who was a very strong player. We would go over to his house (where his father and mother also lived) and play all day and then I would go home before my parents got home from work. The son also had schizophrenia and I sort of could tell but we focused our days on playing chess all day. At the time, I didn't know who his father was. This was a family of brilliant people. His son was a strong chess master. The father was a Nobel Prize winner. Maybe that makes them mentally strong. Maybe not. John, the son, disappeared and we lost touch. I last saw him I think in 1988. Since then I've met a lot of incredibly brilliant people. Because of my podcast and businesses I've been involved in I've met some of the smartest people, some of the most successful people, some of the most brilliant people in the world. Maybe they are mentally strong. Maybe not.Often many of us are very good at constructing masks and it is never really known what is deep inside of us. What we keep hidden for fear of death if others were to find out. But I can tell you what is most in common with some of the people I have encountered and maybe then you can tell me if you think these are qualities of mentally strong people. I would like to know. All of these things...anyone can do. Anyone can learn to be mentally strong and change the world as a result. Wealth, health, success, strong relationships, and freedom seem to be byproducts of the traits listed below. Here's my trick: I list, for each item, 1-10 on where I rank and then I add them up. So somewhere between 0 and 100. Then every day I try to improve by 1. A) RELATIONSHIPSThe mentally strong people I know, the ones who have achieved the most in life, have ALL had incredibly strong relationships. Friends, spouses, partners, and so on. I've interviewed billionaires, well known movie directors, athletes, scientists, artists. All have believed in the saying ""you are the average of the five people you spend your time with"". If you build up strong relationships, it means they are supporting your ideas, adding to them, helping you execute them, and not constantly fighting you or dragging you down. B) HONESTYThis is not religious but math. The brain takes up 2% of the body's mass and burns up 25% of the body's calories each day. One in four calories you eat goes to fuel your brain. When you lie, one side of your brain has to deal with one set of lies. And the other side of the brain has to deal with the other set of lies. So to be at optimal mental strength you now need twice as many calories. This is impossible. So the best way to be mentally strong is to be honest so all of the fuel in your body can be used efficiently at propelling your brain from strength to strength instead of fighting off the attacks on your weaknesses. C) IT'S NOT ABOUT ME, IT'S ABOUT YOUWhenever a girl broke up with me, it never seemed to be about me. That's ok. That was a line to make me feel better. I guess I should be grateful for the many people who tried to make me feel better by blaming themselves. But true mentally strong people constantly are focused on others. They are solving problems for other people. They don't think, ""How can I make money"" since money is just pieces of paper fueled by a mythological story. They think, ""What are problems in the world that I can solve?"" They think, for instance, healthcare is a mess. And since we all know ""prevention is the cure"", how can I develop a product that helps with prevention and diagnostics. And, if you were a genius like Elizabeth Holmes, you would drop out of Stanford, make a company called Theranos, and do exactly that. That is just one example. Mentally strong people are always solving other people's problems. The problems of the individual get solved as a byproduct of solving the problems of the many. D) READINGI've interviewed over 150 people now for my podcast. Here is one question nobody ever hesitates on: What are the last books you've read? Do you know why mentally strong people read? I have my guess. We all have one life to live. But when you read, you get to absorb the curated life of another person in just a few days. So if you read a lot, your one brain can hold onto the critical points of potentially thousands of other incredible people. You can bathe in their lives and come out a stronger you. I asked Freeway Rick Ross, the largest drug dealer ever, what books he read in prison that turned around his life. He couldn't read or write before prison. But then he taught himself. He told me instantly: ""As A Man Thinketh"", ""The Richest Man in Babylon"", and ""Think and Grow Rich"". I asked Tim Ferriss, author of The Four Hour Work Week. He said, ""Radical Acceptance"", ""Essentialism"", and ""The Effective Executive"". All 150 people I have interviewed gave answers instantly. I have no doubt if I ask them again next week they will all have different answers. I have never met a mentally strong person who wasn't a voracious reader. E) HEALTHBecause the brain burns so many calories, you have to have health in other areas of your life. It's hard to be mentally strong, to be creative, to execute, to change the world, if you are sick in bed. This is not being judgmental towards those sick in bed. Sometimes we just get sick. We can't help it. But almost everyone I've ever dealt with in business or in life who has gone on to greater and great successes all acknowledged the importance of constant healthy transformation of their bodies. This doesn't mean lift 500 pounds. It means sleep eight hours a day. It means eat well (which simply means: less on processed foods, more on vegetables, and exchange your 15 inch plates for 10 inch plates), and move. Movement doesn't mean running a marathon. It might just mean walking a lot.Our paleo ancestors got their exercise from walking and climbing on their daily hunt for food. This kept them healthy enough to be our ancestors so I thank them every day for that by following their model. F) CURIOSITYIf you are talking to someone and they say something interesting but you don't understand, do you interrupt them and ask them what they mean? I often don't. And then what happens? Then, for the rest of my life, I will never understand what they mean. Sometimes I'm afraid to ask questions because I don't want to seem stupid or I don't want someone to be annoyed at me or I'm feeling shy. The only way to learn new things is to ask questions and be curious. Find the people who inspire your curiosity because those are the ones you will most learn from. Then ask them questions. The more stupid you feel asking a question, the more you HAVE to ask the question. If you feel shy asking one question, then ask TWO questions. Every mentally strong person has this one thing in common: the things they most remember that has changed their lives have been the answers to questions they asked. If they never asked those questions, their lives would not have changed. G) LEARN, SAY, REPEAT We think we learn in school. We take a class and a brilliant professor gives a lecture and we supposedly leave the class smarter. But here is the science. Within 45 minutes of leaving a class, college students have already forgotten 80% of what was said in the class. By the next day, they have forgotten just about 100%. Here's how to remember: First you hear something. If it interests you, write it down as a note (carry a notebook. I carry a waiter's pad because they are cheap). Then use it in a conversation within an hour. Then use it in a conversation the next day and then the next. NOW there is a decent chance you have learned it. Because you build various connections in your brain that have now been programmed with that nugget of information. That's how learning takes place. Mentally strong people learn how to learn. H) THE IDEA MUSCLEPeople say ""ideas are a dime a dozen"". This is simply not true. Ideas are ""a dime for three"". Go ahead and try. Come up with 10 ideas for surprises for your spouse's next anniversary. The first three are easy. But, for me, then it gets harder and by #7 I'm counting the list over and over again to see if I reached 10. Ideas are a muscle that need to be exercised. If you get hit by a bike and are stuck in bed for two weeks recovering, then when you leave the bed your leg muscles are so atrophied you need therapy to walk again. The same with the idea muscle. It needs to be exercised every day or it will atrophy. How do you exercise it? Pick a theme, any theme will do, and write down ten ideas a day. Every day. I can tell you that when I was broke and suicidal and scared I started doing this. My life has changed 100% every six months since then. It's been incredible. Like magic. I wrote this and shared this with others. Now I get emails from people every six months telling me how their lives have changed. When I was interviewing the rapper Coolio he told me he wrote lyrics down every day for 17 years before he had his first hit. A year after his first hit he had the best selling song on the entire planet. When he described that song to me he described which elements from which musicians who came before him that he meshed together to create his hit. This is called ""idea sex"". When you are an expert in one category and an expert in another then you are the greatest in the world at the intersection. Exercising the idea muscle, plus learning, plus idea sex, will make you be the best in the world at whatever you aim. What about execution? Execution ideas are just a subset of regular ideas. If you have an idea you want to execute on, then your idea list the next day should be, ""What are the ten next steps I need to take?"" Should you then take them? I don't know. Mentally strong people probably make those lists 100 times a year and only need to execute on one of them to change the world. Give yourself permission to have bad ideas. It's only through diligent mining of the universe inside of you that you find the gems that will light up the world. I) PERMISSIONMentally strong people give themselves permission. Why did the Google guys come up with the 8th search engine and think theirs was special? Why did Elizabeth Holmes think it was ok to drop out of the best school in the country to pursue a business dream? Why did Henry Ford, after failing twice at car companies, think it was a good idea to start a third car company. Why did the Wright Brothers think it was ok to make a plane with spare parts from their bicycle shop when the government was spending tens of millions? They all gave themselves permission to do something that has never been done before. They all gave themselves permission to have many bad ideas. They all gave themselves permission to risk their reputation and the forked tongues of the people who would fight them. They gave themselves permission to slip and fall and get up and dust themselves off and try again. And again. And again. And again. They gave themselves permission to love something so strong that every neuron on their brain would light up and conspire to make their dreams come true. If you don't give yourself permission to create a new world, chances are nobody else will. J) PRESENCEI regret so many things from my past. Maybe that one time I lost all of my money, I could've used it to help my father live a little bit longer than he did. Maybe I could've held onto my house. Maybe I could've been smarter about business. And all of the time I am anxious. Will I give a good speech. Will this business I invest in work out? I hope it does. I don't want to go broke again. But whenever you regret the past, or are anxious about the future, you are time traveling. Time traveling seems exciting but it isn't. You can time travel all your life and then suddenly you are dead without ever having lived in the present moment, the only moment that exists. Whenever mentally strong people find themselves time traveling they take a step back. They said, ""What can I do right now to help otihers"" instead of wasting time regretting the past or worrying about the future. Worry and regret never solves tomorrow's problems and only drains away energy from today. Presence will always solve this moment's problems. Mentally strong people solve problems, love people, are curious, stay healthy, have idea sex, are honest with you, and make the world a better place. I hope each day I can improve a little on each level. And if I run into you on the street, maybe we can wink at each other. We're on the same team.",2015-05-05T14:53:55.000Z
How A Computer Beat The World Chess Champion and...,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-computer-beat-world-chess-champion-gandhi-freed-300-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,2724,163,29,2015-05-04 00:00:00,8.0,"I knew I was going to get thrown out of school. I had already failed three out of the four classes (we took one class a semester). We would get these tests on a Monday morning and have to turn them in by Tuesday at 5pm. Everyone worked all night, for 30 straight hours. I'm not ashamed to say I cheated on all of them. But still I failed them. Everyone was so smart in the program, I knew I had no way to compete. My officemate - his name was CB - was the inventor of the best chess computer in the world at the time. Several years later, after IBM swooped CB and the computer up, the computer (called ""Deep Blue"" then) became the first computer to beat the world champion at chess when it beat Garry Kasparov. I worked on it a little. And IBM even offered me a job to work on it more. But I didn't take the job. I was afraid to break out of my routine. I liked a girl who didn't like me. I liked my friends. I liked my easy life. IBM seemed too ""real world"" to me at the time. BUT here's the secret to how a computer beat the world chess champion for the first time in history: They made the computer as stupid as possible. Other chess computers were ""smart"". They knew how to analyze chess positions very well. Deep Blue didn't do that. Deep Blue did the minimum needed to figure out if a position was good or bad. They stripped almost all of the intelligence out of it. Then it had time to move onto the next position and the next position. Hundreds of millions of positions a second while other computers were wasting time with complicated formulas on each position. Deep Blue did ""ready. fire. aim."" Entrepreneurs should do that also. And writers. And anyone. By reducing the amount of software and intelligence, the computer became the best in the world. Most intelligence should be subtracted. Most experiences should be said ""no"" to. The times when I thought I was smart are probably the times I was most stupid. That's why when they stripped all of the intelligence out of a chess computer, it suddenly became the best chess computer in the world. It beat the world chess champion. And then, before IBM could take any chances, they unplugged the computer. It went dark.They put it in the same warehouse as the Lost Ark, and Deep Blue never played another game of chess again.",2015-05-04T14:35:58.000Z
About The Time I Forced Her,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/time-i-forced-her-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,15308,473,100,2015-05-01 00:00:00,10.0,"I forced Claudia to do something she didn't want to do. She was scared but I still made her do it. She had written a lot of inspirational posts about yoga over the prior year. This was in 2010 or 2011. I forget. I had her print up all of her articles and put them down on the ground. Admire them. Love them. Then I had her gather up the ones she loved the most and make one pile. Then I took a stapler and stapled them all together. ""There!"" I said, ""Now you have a book."" But its just a collection of blog posts, she said. Here's the thing: a. Very few people have read your blogb. The people who search ""yoga"" on Amazon have never heard of you. c. This is JUST a first draft. Rewrite it so it goes from a collection of blog posts to a real book. Write more chapters. Build seamless connections between the various ideas. Do other ""book"" things. You're going to have at least ten drafts before you have a book done. d. You're only going to charge 99 cents. I'd pay you 99 cents for a curation and rewriting of all of your best work. You aren't asking for much. I then took a sexy picture of her, doing a yoga pose on a rock leaning right over the Hudson River. That became the cover. A few weeks later, we uploaded to Amazon. She actually made several changes to the book (with new uploads) after the first upload to Amazon. For almost a year her book was #1 in the Yoga category on Amazon or, if not always #1, always in the top ten. Was it a masterpiece! Was it ""War and Peace""? Probably not. Was it her first book?Yes! Now she was an author. A bestselling author. Since then she's written two other books, both bestsellers. One a Wall St Journal bestseller. She's working on another book right now. It's easy to come up with excuses:",2015-05-01T14:49:43.000Z
Is Failure Good?,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/failure-good-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,8326,484,100,2015-04-29 00:00:00,9.0,"Failure is not good.Failure is the worst thing possible. You feel sick. You feel like you're going to die. You feel like if you don't die you might kill yourself.There is absolutely nothing good about failure. And there's nothing you can pretend to learn from failure.Lately, we've been living in the Golden Age of Failure Porn. Everyone wants to share their story. Everyone wants to ""fail forward"".You can't learn anything from failure because don't forget that every single moment in your past has added up to that one moment in your present - where you are lying on the floor moaning your painful and abysmal failure.Stop whining. And stop using the word ""failure"". Blah!Here are better things to learn from. Failure has many cousins. Learn from one of the cousins:Curiosity: When something happens and you don't understand why, then ask, ""Why?""Keep asking questions. Clearly, something confusing happened. Ask and ask and ask.Guess what will happen: you will get answers.Experiment: Sometimes people say Thomas Edison failed 999 times before he finally came up with the lightbulb on the 1000th try.This is a total lie. It is normal in a lab to experiment with many many materials before coming up with the right one.Oh! Your experiment didn't work? Ok, change something and let's try a new experiment.Persistence: I get asked: how do I market my book? Or my app? Answer: write another book. Write another app.The best way to get better, to get more known, to learn the subtleties of your art or your field or your sport, is to simply do it again.Persistence + Love = Abundance.Forgiveness: I used to live in regret. One time I sold a business for $15 million. Within two years I had lost almost all of the money.And it wasn't money on paper. It was money in ""real life"". If I tell you how I lost it you would hate me forever. That's ok. But it's not important for this answer.""Failure"" is a word used to label a past event. That's 100% up to you how you label a past event.When you label a past event ""failure"" it prevents you from moving beyond the past. You get stuck there. You keep time traveling to the moment of failure under the excuse that there is something to learn there.The thing you learn first is forgiveness. Then you move back to the present. Get healthy. Be around people you love. Start being creative again.Study: When you get a question wrong on a test, a good student doesn't call it a failure.It's a pointer to one single question wrong on a test. Study a bit more next time and you won't get that question wrong anymore.Understand and study and remember the correct answer. Don't keep living in the past where you remember the wrong answer.Athletes always go over their losses. They study videos. Go over games. Get advice from coaches. The coach doesn't say, ""here's where you failed!""He says, ""here's where you should turn right instead of turn left.""Botvinnik, the World Chess Champion in the 1950s, noticed he often lost chess games to people who smoked.So he would play practice games against people who would smoke in his face.He didn't say ""I fail against smokers"". He became the World Chess Champion because of smokers.""Failure"" is not a detail you can learn from. Again, it's a label that describes nothing except a feeling inside of you.Details are what you can study and learn from.Hard Problems: The key to success is to solve hard problems. Searching the Internet is hard. Google does it better than anyone.Making an electric car is hard. Tesla does it better than anyone.Figuring out a market for post-it notes was hard. The inventor tried for over 20 years. Now it's 3M's most successful consumer product.Writing a book is hard. Maybe your last book was bad. That's ok. That happens to everyone's first book. Now read a lot of good books so you can solve the hard problem of what makes a good book. Then write.Failure is not a hard problem. It's a label. Failure is in the past. Hard problems can be solved right now.Don't Care: When I thought I had failed, what I really was worried about was: would other people think I was a failure?Yes. Yes they did.When I stopped caring about that, when I took the word out of my vocabulary, I suddenly stopped caring what people thought.Then what happened? Only good things.",2015-04-29T13:25:32.000Z
The Best Advice Ever To A Teenage Daughter Who...,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-advice-ever-teenage-daughter-who-needs-make-money-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,47222,889,166,2015-04-27 00:00:00,11.0,"She said ""No"" to me and slammed the door. She was on my paper route. I asked out every girl on my paper route. All three of them. I liked having a captive audience. I'd hand them the paper and say, ""Want to go to a movie?"" They all said ""No"". Well, one girl said, ""Yes"" but then the next day her brother told me she really meant ""No"". I made about $2 an hour on my paper route. It took me about four hours a day and then another five or six hours on the weekends collecting money. One time, delivering papers, a guy drove by and yelled, ""one day you're going to rule the world!"" I guess because delivering papers somehow showed work ethic. I worked hard but hated it. I had no life but delivering papers. So I will tell you another story. Don't tell anyone please. It's our secret. The local video store once gave me pamphlets to put at every house on my route. He gave me a $20 bill. I took it. Within 15 minutes, I threw all the pamphlets in the sewer and never went back to that store. All of this is to say: My daughter is considering taking an $8 an hour job. I said to her, instead of that: why don't you go to Lynda.com or CodeAcademy.com and learn basic Wordpress skills. You can make blogs for stores. It would take you ONE DAY to learn the basics. Then go from door to door to every store in town. Say for $1000, plus $50 / month maintenance, you'll make their blog or basic website for them and help them upkeep it. If they require a ""shopping cart"" then charge them $2500. She frowned a little and said, ""They will say No. They don't need it."" She doesn't want anyone to say No to her. I can relate to that. I don't like it when people say No to me either. I said, ""Ok, we have about 40 stores on this street. Let's say only 2 say yes. That's $2000. It will take you ten hours to do the work. That's $200 an hour instead of $8 an hour. And then the $100 a month you make in maintenance will take you about two hours a month.Here's another idea, I said. To be on Wikipedia you need about 10 media references. We were in a restaurant. I pointed at the wall. ""How many reviews does this restaurant have."" She was digging in. ""I don't know."" She looked away. ""More than ten,"" I said. ""So you can make a Wikipedia page for them. Charge $200. Maintain it for $10 a month."" Or maybe every store needs a Facebook page. 1 in 7 Americans are on Facebook RIGHT NOW THIS SECOND. Restaurants can use their Page to get local customers to ""Like"" them in exchange for coupons and future messages. Again: $500 for setup and $20 per store per month to maintain. She didn't want to do it. It's not a skills issue. ANYONE can get the skills by studying one or two online courses for about a day or two. She does have skills at drawing logos, editing short videos, and some basic design skills she can improve with a course or two. On fiverr or freelancer.com she can do an infographic for $20-50 and it would take her thirty minutes. Why work for a boss? Here's my guess. She wants to work at a hang out place. So she can work while seeing her friends. Ok, I get that. I would love to work at the same time that I hang out with my friends. But if she started doing what I suggest here's what she would learn: A. SHE WOULD CREATE SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHINGMost jobs don't let you create something out of nothing. You just move some shit over to some other shit and get paid shit. The best things in the world are when you create something out of nothing. Like: I created her (in part) out of nothing. I admit I had help with that. B. BASIC COMPUTER SKILLSSeriously: if you think you don't have computer skills, take three online courses. Now you are in the top 1% of the world in computer skills and can charge for those skills. C. REJECTIONThe most AMAZING skill to learn. I've put in my 10,000 hours of being rejected. I am a MASTER of rejection. Every time you get rejected you learn a little more about yourself, about how to approach people, about building strength, about getting out your comfort zone. D. SALESShe'll learn to look at a situation and find what the urgent problem is, what a useful solution can be, and how can she uniquely solve it. E. YOUR NEW BEST CUSTOMERS ARE YOUR OLD CUSTOMERSOnce she starts making money she'll do what most people do - she'll want to make more money. There's only two ways people who make money make more money.",2015-04-27T12:26:13.000Z

I had a lunch today with a guy who worked in the mailroom at Hannah-Barbera which made all my cartoon favorites from the 70s: The Flintstones, Scooby-Doo, The Jetsons, and so on. He used to pitch ideas every day to Joe Barbera. ""I was working in the mailroom but I kept coming up with ideas for cartoons. I would send them up to Joe Barbera and I had no idea if he would like them or not. Then eventually he pulled me over and I started helping on all the scripts.""

""I wrote that. ""What about the Jetsons?"" ""Wrote it."" And so on. Impressive guy. He killed himself at one thing for 30 years and wrote all these classics I grew up on. I've met or interviewed so many people in the last year. In the last five years. In the last 25 years. People who have amazed me. I try to learn from them and sometimes I can learn a little bit. When I meet someone I try to learn one thing that I will never forget. It adds up.Like how someone got inspired by a pencil to build a hundred schools in third world countries (Adam Braun) or about someone who wrote lyrics every day while 97% of his friends were killed by the time his childhood was over and then he made the bestselling song of 1995 (Coolio). Or the Congressman obsessed with meditation Or the other congressman who is now running for President. Or the 72 year old who runs the largest beer company in the country.

I was desperately afraid I couldn't feed my family. I made a lot of money. I thought I would never have to worry forever. Then I fell in love with someone. Then I lost it all. Made it back. Lost. Made. Lost. Made. What a roller coaster! I wasn't making dreams. I just wanted to feed my family. I think I came up with a strategy to keep me balanced. To allow me to grow and flourish instead of just worry. But really, past that, I don't care. I'm happy I feed my family now after such a roller coaster. I don't want to own a basketball team.

Started a company that didn't work. Read a lot. Then started another company. He wanted me to advise his company. I didn't do it. But we spoke for awhile about his being a high school dropout.He said, ""Once I figured out how I can learn to learn then I didn't need school anymore."" I didn't know whether to believe him. But I liked that phrase, ""learn to learn"". He made an app that didn't work. Nobody wanted it. Not even his friends who said they wanted it. I was thinking a year or two later: thank god I didn't advise that company. So he backed off and asked himself why the app wasn't as popular as he thought it would be. Nobody can predict the future. A Harvard PhD and a high school dropout have equal skills at prophecy. He called up the top people at many companies and asked them if there was any part of his app that they would want. He met with maybe 50 heads of technology at all sorts of different companies in different industries. He figured out what their problems were. He listened and studied. Then he rewrote his app. Just slightly. He also rewrote the way he described the app. Just slightly. It's now four years later. I'm not saying the name of his company because I don't know if news was announced yet. But he just raised $60 million at a $250 million valuation. He's on track for great revenues this year. My friend who was giving me this update said, ""I've never seen anything like this. He has a 100% close rate on his sales calls. Everyone buys."" Is he uneducated? Of course not. He reads constantly. Maybe more than anyone I know. Did he not get networked enough? Of course not. He created his network by helping them solve their problems. If I'm not mistaken, Google is one of his top investors. Do I regret not advising his company? No. I'm not a very good advisor I think. I like to sit in my room with the shades closed. If you go for every opportunity you end up chasing everyone else's dreams except your own. It's good to know what you are good at and what you are not so good at. I like to deliver value my own way. Everything has turned upside down. FOR THE FIRST GENERATION IN HISTORY, since Julius Caesar, we are on track to make less money than the generation before us. And with $1.2 trillion in college debt to pay back on top of it. This is not just in America. The entire world is having this problem. This generation will make less than the generation before. We were all told to go to school and get a job and incomes would rise. We were all told a lie. Admittedly, we have some good things going for us. I can take any course I want for almost free. I can read books on my kindle.I have a computer (courtesy of college dropouts like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates) and I can always see what my friends are up to (courtesy of college dropout Mark Zuckerberg) and I can even diagnose any diseases I have cheaper than ever (courtesy of college dropout Elizabeth Holmes). I can stay informed if I want (but I don't) courtesy of an expelled college student (Ted Turner) and I can eat healthy (courtesy of college dropout Whole Foods founder John Mackay). You can say, these are all anecdotes. That's true! I have no defense. And yet, I can read, write, connect, eat, stay healthy, etc so I have time and energy to learn. I'm an anecdote also. I went to college and then graduate school. Was thrown out of graduate school (coincidentally by the friend I had dinner with last night who told me the update about the high school dropout). I then started to read everything I wanted. I then started to live the life I wanted to live. But it took a long time. I had many passions. I'm still working my way through them.I hope it doesn't take so long for my own daughters. I hope they learn how to learn.

Are You A Quit-Switcher or A Switch-Quitter,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/you-quit-switcher-switch-quitter-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,12395,425,59,2015-04-17 00:00:00,9.0,"Kid musicals are the worst. Can you imagine: waking up and saying, ""I have to see that awful musical being put on by 10 year olds today instead of doing anything else in the entire world."" But it reminds me of a story. Theodore Geisel 's first book ""And To Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street"" came out in 1937. It had been rejected 26 times by publishers. This is one of those stories of: and then it got accepted. Because it did. On the 27th time. I would've given up. Probably #20. I would've said: ""I'm no good at this"". And I would've switched to something else. There's nothing wrong with switching. In fact, I did switch.I wrote novels, they got rejected. I switched. I'm a quitter and a switcher. A quit-switcher. But then I did other things that I loved. And I got a little better at them. I was a quit-switcher but not a switch-quitter. I kept switching until I found something I loved. People write me and say, ""I give up. I failed"". They are very depressed. I ask them their age. 22. Sometimes they are 52. It doesn't matter. It's ok to jump from table to table, knocking everything off. To Quit and Switch. Quit and Switch. You don't need to submit the 27th time.The problem is this: when you first do something you love, you realize how bad you are at it. Because you love work done by masters while you are still an amateur. So you are too stupid to quit but smart enough that you see the huge gap between you and someone who is good. You close the gap with love and persistence. That's why persistence + love = mastery.Persistence means you get 1% better every day, no matter how you add it up. Love means you begin to see the subtleties that nobody else sees. From there it takes a long time. A lot of persistence and a lot of love. If you don't have the persistence and love, it's ok to quit-switch. Persistence and Love are not about fame. Or not about money. It's like a kiss. Two people afraid at first, stumbling unsure. It might take many kisses. You search. You fumble around. Finally, it's about the moment where you meet each other in the middle. I didn't have enough faith in myself. I didn't have enough faith in my work. I didn't have enough faith in a system where a handful of people could reject me. So I didn't love and I didn't persist. All of that has changed now. There's a new system - a system without gatekeepers. And there are things I love enough to try and find the subtleties that were once hidden. If Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss) gave up on the 26th try we would never have his second book: The Cat in the Hat. We would have no Grinch and no Green Eggs.There wouldn't be my father reading, ""Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are?"" as I fell to sleep. Long before he became mentally ill when he would forget his own luck. Last year, according to Brian Grazer's book, ""A Curious Mind"" (I highly recommend), Dr. Seuss's books sold almost 4 million copies even though he's been dead for 25 years. This weekend I watched my daughter perform as ""The Cat in the Hat"" in the local musical ""Seussical"". If Dr. Seuss hadn't tried that 27th time I wouldn't have seen her light up the stage. It made me happy to see that. I'm glad Dr. Seuss tried the 27th time. ""The Cat in the Hat"" is a mischievous character. He teaches the little kids to break the rules. If you worry too much about the future, you can't enjoy your now. Dr. Seuss knew that. He taught us that. I try to remember. That when someone says ""No"" to you, you're allowed to ask (silently or not) ""Why?"" and ""Why not?""I hate plays. I hate musicals. I hate sitting for 90 minutes on uncomfortable chairs in uncomfortable gyms. I also dislike failure porn: ""if so-and-so didn't submit that last time there would be no Grinch, no Harry Potter, no Luke Skywalker, no Google, no light bulb."" It's ok to not make that final try. To live your life the way you want. To try many things. To love many types of subtlety. It's only when you quit switching that you begin to die. But I'm glad Theodore Geissel had faith and persistence. So I could watch my baby girl, maybe for the last time, sing and dance like a great big cat.",2015-04-17T14:08:23.000Z

I was too curious. I thought I would die if I didn't ask.Whenever you are curious about something, don't forget to ask a question. Curious. Question....Curious ==&gt; Question. The only things you will ever remember are the questions you ask when you are curious. Curiosity is the ONLY technique for learning.I was talking with a guy who was incredibly inspiring and he seemed to really know what his purpose in life was. So I got curious. I asked him how anyone could find out what their passion is. The people who feel stuck in their lives. He said: Imagine you have a billion dollars. Think of all the things you can do now. Subtract out everything that is a luxury. For me, for instance, I'd hire someone to do all my shopping and maybe bathe me. I have to subtract that because that's like a luxury. I asked Claudia. She said she'd fly to Buenos Aires. I said, ""You can do that right this second. That's all you can think of if you got a billion dollars?"" Maybe she just wants to get away from me until I shower. But anyway, subtract the bigger house, the boat, the trips, the chefs, the assistants, the bigger car, the plane. What would you DO? Not what you would HAVE.Now...figure out how to that thing RIGHT NOW. Without the billion dollars. Naveen Jain told me this technique. He's going to the moon. He started moonexpress.com. He's already developed a lunar lander. NASA agrees it will work. He's going to head over to the moon by 2020 and I believe him. One of the smartest people I've ever spoken to. He wakes up at 4:30am and reads constantly about the things he's interested in: space research, medical research, neuroscience. He said also, ""let's say you want to be a philanthropist"". This doesn't mean give all your money away. He said, ""you still have to make it sustainable. So it's okay if it's a sustainable business."" For instance, if he can get to the moon, he can mine for rare earth minerals which are quite valuable here. Then once it's a sustainable business he can achieve his true objectives, which is to use the moon as a sort of launching pad for other planets. I like this. He didn't need money to do this dream. He's rich but he raised the money, he hired the scientists, he mapped out the dream, he found the business model, and in 2020 he's going to land on the moon. I'm going to add to this. Someone asked me yesterday what I thought about Warren Buffett's ""5/25"" technique: A) Write down the top 25 things you want to do with your life. B) Focus on the first 5C) NEVER EVER FOCUS AGAIN on the next 20. AVOID THEM. They are only distractions if you truly want to be good at the first five.I actually think it's wrong to focus on the first five. Focus maybe on the first two or three. Of the 105 people who have been on my podcast I can tell you the first two for every single one of them. For example: Mark Cuban: Money and basketball. Coolio: Rap and cooking.Claudia: Yoga and writing. I love to write things that will help people. I love to entertain. I don't need a billion dollars to do that but if I had a billion dollars I would do those things.Well, what if you have no money? I had no money. And it took years to figure out how to do the things I wanted to do. For all 105 of my podcast guests it took them years. But if I had a billion dollars, I'd do the things I'm doing right now.And I'd keep trying to get better at them. I have other things on my list also. I wish I could paint. I wish I could play the piano better. I wish I could run a billion revenue business. But you know what: I'm not going to focus on those things. They are not in my top three. Maybe they are somewhere around 15-20. I'm going to give you one other technique for finding purpose. The Plan B technique. Otherwise known as the morning after pill. It's the morning after and you realize your absolute #1 dream didn't work out. But divide the dream into categories. Ok, I like to entertain. That might mean write, or it might mean speak, or it might mean, write fiction, or it might mean ten other things. So do this and tell me what happens:",2015-04-14T11:16:52.000Z

He was fat. He hated his work. He was unhappy. A few years later he ran, swam, biked, 703 miles in seven days when he was 45 years old. When he was 40 he had a job he was unhappy at but he was still trying to live the American dream: the two cars, the beautiful family, partnership at a law firm.""I thought I was having a heart attack on the staircase,"" he said. ""I was 50 pounds overweight. I was working 80 hours a week. I wasn't happy. I was going to die."" That moment on the staircase was one of three or four turning points in Rich Roll's life that forced him to say: ""I have a small window to change for the better."" And then he did it.But what's interesting to me is that Rich Roll is an addict. I'm an addict. Many people I know are addicts. Many addictions are bad for you. When I was younger I was addicted to just about everything that could possibly be harmful to me.Rich Roll, when he was 31 years old and a high-priced lawyer, had to check himself into a 100 day rehab after he was drunk-driving the wrong way down a one way street.While in rehab he noticed something interesting. ""At first it felt really horrible, and then it felt better.""When he was 40, he wasn't drinking but he threw those obsessions into his NEXT unhealthy addiction. ""I was living on the window diet"" - if you can drive up to a window and order the food then that's what he would eat. Like three Wendy's cheeseburgers.He threw himself into the lifestyle of top lawyer, 80 hours a week, eat whatever you can. But that moment on the stairs made him realize, with heart disease in his family, that he was at risk.So he started a seven day cleanse. All juices.""In the first three days I felt horrible, but I knew from my experience in rehab that it would get a lot better"".And it did. At the end of the juicing he felt incredibly energetic and cleansed.This was his third addiction. Gradually he went from juicing to a ""junk vegetarian"" style (pizza, etc) to real plant-based vegan lifestyle.""I had so much energy I couldn't stop moving. Even sitting at rest I couldn't stop tapping my leg.""So one day he went for a run. He ran 24 miles. His biggest run prior that was 8 miles!And that was 22 years earlier. Sorry, Rich, if I'm getting the numbers slightly wrong.After that he realized this was some latent ability that was coming out so he started to train.He trained every day. He started running in ""Iron Man"" competitions. Then the competitions got more and more intense until he did his 700 mile Hawaii run. 5 Irons Mans in 7 days.This was his fourth addiction.He was named one of the 50 fittest men in the world.But he was still a lawyer part-time and training part-time.He wrote a book about his lifestyle. ... He started giving talks for free. Going to conferences. Spreading the world on this healthy lifestyle that had changed his life, invigorated his relationships, and catapulted him to being one of the healthiest people in the world.This was his fifth addiction. He couldn't stop spreading the word about what was happening to him.""It was hard at first,"" he said. ""I wasn't getting paid and I was traveling everywhere."" Gradually he started making a living at his new career and he gave up his job as a lawyer.His book ""Plantpower"" is about to come out, describing his lifestyle even more. Rich and I are one year apart in age. I can't even run down the block although I try to live a healthy lifestyle.People always demonize addiction. It's bad! Don't be an addict!But there are positive addictions. ""Well-being"" is being addicted to three things: Competence, Positive relationships, Autonomy. And maybe one more thing: Growth every day in all three of those areas. If you do those things, I can tell you you will feel well-being today, no matter what else is going on in your life. The first few days or weeks or months are really hard and then as Rich says, ""suddenly it gets better."" When I was talking to Rich for an upcoming podcast, he would use the same language often when describing a bad addiction and a positive addiction.",2015-04-13T14:01:51.000Z

When a relationship fails, often it's because I've been a -1. Certainly stalking and begging and crying has made me a -1 many times.When I clam up in my shell, refusing to take responsibility, afraid to return calls, afraid to admit responsibility, that's -1 behavior. When I think I'm a +1, often I'm a -1.Even worse, even much worse, is when other people think you are a -1.There's a saying, ""it's none of my business what people think of me"".But sayings are fun to say and hard to live.When people think I'm a -1 I have a tendency to add all of those people up. Sometimes that makes me a -1000.Claudia says, ""trust me, a 1000 people aren't thinking of you.""I said to her, ""but what about the 1000 voices in my head. All shouting ""BAD!""""Being a +1 is usually too difficult to me. I never know what I'm doing.For instance, one time I was CEO of a company that was my idea. I was very good at raising money. We raised $30 million.I had no idea how much money we made. What our costs were. I didn't even know what our product did. I had bought it with the money we raised.I was so afraid to talk to people, I would get in early and lock the door behind me and not answer the door when people knocked.Eventually they fired me as CEO. Then they fired me from the board. Then they took my shares away. I went from a ""+1"" to a ""-1"" very quickly.It's good to be a zero sometimes. To learn and listen and help.When I do a podcast I feel like a zero.I ask people to come on my podcast because I want to learn something from them. How to be a better person. They are +1 people. I'd like to be like them. So I ask them questions.Here are the qualities of a zero. LISTEN to what people tell you. Maybe they experienced something you have never experienced.Our brain can curate the experiences of others so maybe it can help us live our own lives better. OBSERVE what people do.We have what are called ""mirror neurons"". If I think I'm a +1 in ""firing a gun"" I might shoot myself and kill myself.If I watch someone over and over firing a gun then my mirror neurons kick in and I might be able to do it myself if asked.Although I hope nobody asks me. HUMILITY.Some people are great people. They are kind. They are humble. They are productive. They are competent. They get things done. Then they get AMAZING things done.When you compare, you despair. When you are humble, you learn. When you get curious, you get better.How did they get this way? Oh! They read some books. They wrote some books. They had some ideas. They worked hard every day for years. They saved some lives.Ok. Now I learned from them. Maybe I can do some of that also. 1/10 of that if I'm lucky.

33 Tips To Being A Better Writer – Plus One Key...,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/33-tips-being-better-writer-plus-one-key-creativity-i-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,11210,361,61,2015-04-09 00:00:00,9.0,"I wrote a blog post that was horrible. Claudia said, ""People won't relate.""I rewrote it completely. She said, ""much better"". I published it and that practically ruined my life. I loved it so much. I became obsessed with blogging. I read every day. I wrote every day. Eventually I rewrote some stuff and made books out of them. Some of the books became bestsellers.Claudia went over each book and told me what to take out and what to keep in. Then she worked on the design of each book. Then she worked on the publishing of each book. She says, ""these are practically my books"". Then I started giving talks. I started getting paid to be on boards or give advice. People were buying my books. I started a newsletter. I get many opportunities because of the writing. All because I kept a discipline of writing every day. But that's NOT what did it. That's not what I'm writing about.What did it for me was having a partner. A partner that helped me get things done. A partner that filled in the gaps of my creativity. There's no such thing as a lone genius. Every Steve Jobs has a Steve Wozniak. Every Marie Curie has a Pierre Curie. Every Lennon has a McCartney. Even the most isolated genius (Picasso) had a Braque. Claudia now has a book out. It's been #1 in her category since it came out. Now people are paying HER to give talks. For five years, I've helped edit every one of Claudia's blog posts. I take out words. I take out paragraphs. I take out half the article. We even do a podcast together. Ugh, it sounds like I'm bragging. I'm not. The reverse. I used to write boring stuff about stocks.Now I write about those ugly places where my past intersects with my present. Where I'm trying to still get through the prickly needles that give me pain every time my mind remembers. I couldn't do that without a partner. Writing is ultimately something you do by yourself. But finding someone who helps you move beyond what you would be by yourself is the key to making something that stands out. Doesn't have to be a spouse. I can tell you - maybe it shouldn't be. And it doesn't have to end well (Lennon and McCartney, Jobs and Wozniak, Freud and Jung). I look back at the 150 people or so I've interviewed for my podcasts. Artists, authors, billionaires, astronauts, creatives in every space. 100% of them (100% !) had their McCartney, or their Simone De Beauvoir, or their Sheryl Sandberg. Creativity wins when you take two minds that can complete each others sentences, but enough differences between them that your creativity lights on fire exploring those differences. With this one idea in mind, find the people who complete your sentences. List all your interests, go to meetups to meet like-minded people. Share your work online and see who is most excited. Get together with the people in your social network and come up with ideas for each other. See if 1+1 = infinity. We define the people around us. And they define us. Find the right dictionary. The key to creativity is to give to someone else. And for them to give back to you something better. Repeat.",2015-04-09T14:45:28.000Z
The One Commandment of Jesus,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/one-commandment-jesus-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,9903,365,86,2015-04-08 00:00:00,9.0,"We were all beating each other up because of Jesus. We were six years old and half of us were Jews and half were Christians. I will tell you this: when I was growing up, my parents didn't say nice things about Jesus. And, I can imagine, when my Christian friends were growing up, maybe they probably don't hear nice things about Jews.This is not anti-semitism. This is normal. People are hatched into their little tribes and only later fly out of the nest.Black and white is easy for a six year old and only when we later roll around in the mud of life do we appreciate the beautiful color gray.Finally, Greg Fiorvanti stopped everyone from fighting. Someone had hit him in the face and he was crying and dirty.He yelled, ""Can we all just agree that Jesus was a great teacher?"" And then, just like we saw our fathers do every day, we went back and forth and shook hands with each other.Greg's father was the CEO of MTV. We were all little white middle-class boys living in a little suburb near New York City. We were tiny Jihadists on a playground.My friends parent's (Jews) didn't like me because I always talked about how Jesus could walk on water. Like Superman. Moses was pretty impressive also. Someone should make one of those buddy-cop movies where Jesus and Moses are the cops. Or Yoda and Morgan Freeman. Thomas Jefferson spent his entire post-Presidency life devoted to coming up with an accurate story of Jesus. He didn't like all the contradictions and varying stories of Jesus' life in the different gospels.He used a razor to cut passages out of the different gospels and paste them into one coherent book which he never published but it's called ""The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth."" He left out the miracles and the angels and anything supernatural because he felt this corrupted the original message of Jesus. He told John Adams those stories were used to placate the Romans who loved the stories of miracles in their own gods.He never published the book. He didn't want to upset anyone. He did it for his own inspiration. Never taking anything as ""gospel"" he essentially composed his own set of beliefs just for himself and his own happiness.Leo Tolstoy, after he wrote ""War and Peace"" did the same thing and it took him about 30 years. In 1880 he published ""The Kingdom of God is Within You"". This book focused not on a supernatural heaven that waits us later but on the choices we can make today that can make us happy and inspiring: ""Turn the other cheek"".Gandhi, a Hindu, lists this book as the most influential book in his approach to non-violence when dealing with an oppressive government. Gandhi and Tolstoy wrote back and forth with each other for years. In these books, ONE thing stands out for me. And it's extremely relevant in this era of ""outrage porn"". Everyone screaming all day long on the Internet about the slightest wrongs they can find in everyone else. Jesus says about the crowd who wants to stone the adulterer, ""let he who is blameless cast the first stone"".The older people leave first, then the younger people. Jesus isn't paying attention. Oddly, he's just doodling in the sand. No miracles. Finally, he asks the woman, ""Has no one condemned you?"" Almost as if he were daydreaming the entire time and didn't notice what was happening. It's probably weirdest story in the New Testament. She says, ""No, sir."" And he says, ""I don't condemn you either"".He DOESN'T say ""I forgive you."" Forgiveness is not something you can give to others. It's not like ice cream. Forgiveness is the gift I give myself. Forgiveness and anger and fear and hatred are all things that happen inside of ourselves. I know when I'm upset at someone, it ruins everything I touch after that. I can't sleep. I can't write. I can't work.It's like that cartoon of the guy typing and yelling: ""Honey, I can't go to sleep right now! Someone is WRONG on the Internet!"" We choose for ourselves what we feel. When we let other people choose our feelings, we mirror their mediocrity. We mirror their weakness instead of choosing our strength.As the great Morgan Freeman says, ""Let me ask you something. If someone prays for patience, you think God gives them patience? Or does he give them the opportunity to be patient? If he prays for courage, does God give him courage, or does he give him opportunities to be courageous?""The best way to help the other people in this extraordinary dream we are in is to wake up.And then what happens?Morgan Freeman again, ""You change the world.""",2015-04-08T12:20:21.000Z

Not everyone can be an Elizabeth Holmes, who dropped out of Stanford at 19, started a business in a basement, and is now a multi-billionaire. Not everyone can be a Bill Gates. Or a Beyonce (although Claudia wants to be Beyonce in her next life. Which I hope that means I come back as Jay-Z). Sometimes people say to me: ""not everyone can be X"". Not everyone can choose themselves! Or, ""Maybe focus on helping others instead of choosing yourself!"" Ok. I don't argue. There are always exceptional people. But exceptions are created, they are not born. Every person on the planet is a future amazing anecdote right now. Here's the questions I try to ask myself every day. Sometimes I forget. I try to follow my own advice and I get better at it. But like everything, it takes practice.  Is it better to be sick in bed, or to do one small thing a day to improve my health? Yesterday it was warm enough to play tennis. So I played with my daughter. Which is great because I get to exercise and also spend quality time with her. And also, she's the only person I can beat although she's getting better pretty fast. Is it better to be around people who will laugh at me and put me down? Or is it better to be around people who inspire me and who will support my dreams, even when they change every day? Like yesterday, I was obsessed with doing an impression of Morgan Freeman. Claudia put up with me for hours trying to talk like Morgan Freeman while she was doing her own work. Then I wrote down 15 jokes I can say about Morgan Freeman and both Claudia and my daughter picked out the funnier ones. Both were kind to me although Mollie said, ""You don't sound anything like Morgan Freeman.""  Is it better to try and be creative? Or is it better to be unoriginal in everything you do? This question is not easy to answer. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" means, ""sometimes you shouldn't be original"". But still - it's a fun exercise to try and be creative every day. Or to pretend to be Morgan Freeman.  Is it better to be grateful today? Or to complain? I try to find one thing I'm miserable about. Like, right this second, I can feel it in my stomach - I'm upset about some things people have said about me. That's ok. It's an opportunity to turn it into what I call a ""difficult gratitude problem"". If I can find ten things to be grateful about these people who said these things then my gratitude muscle will be improved. That sounds corny. But it's better than being upset. Or dwelling. If I can answer all these questions then I know I will help others. How come? Because it's a miracle that a tiny cloud can obscure the massive moon. Get rid of the clouds, and you can make it to the moon. Others can follow you there.",2015-04-06T12:42:24.000Z

When a business fails, the owner makes two calls. One to the bank and the next call to Steve. Steve sells their equipment, furniture, inventory, everything. Maybe he buys it cheap and sells it. Maybe he sells it for a commission. Either way he's trying to help them scrape the last piece of dream out of their reality.He makes a profit on everything he sells. He didn't go to college. He has a healthy seven figure a year business liquidating other businesses. Go Steve! There are always businesses failing. 85% of businesses fail. One quick note: if you are profitable on day one, then the odds go down to 20% that you will fail. This doesn't have to be a sad time. Dreams are a rainbow. Reality is in the spectrum of colors. Then it rains and a new set of dreams come out. I spoke to Steve for almost an hour and put the conversation on my podcast. I wanted to learn more how he did his business and then I got excited and exchanged ideas how I thought he could make his business much bigger. I shouldn't say ""exchange"". I gave un-asked-for advice to an already thriving business and he politely said, ""ok"". I can't help myself. But this is not why I bring up Steve. I don't want you to have to liquidate your business.I hope you never have to call Steve (sorry Steve). Here's why I bring up Steve: Steve wrote me last night. He said, ""I've gotten some great leads from that podcast And loads of emails from people offering suggestions.""And these aren't guys trying to sell me their service. Just your listeners offering to help. You've got a very nice group of people listening to you. Thanks."" I'm really proud of that. Pride kills, right? But it's great to see people connect. The strength of your connections' connections is the true value of your network. That's a combination of your skills, your beliefs, your character, your effort to reach out and help others. And your ability to step outside the boundaries set up nicely for you by everyone else. The gatekeepers, your colleagues, your bosses, sometimes family, sometimes huge industries or government. The people who laughed at your dreams. The best way to choose yourself is to build a community of other people choosing themselves. This is the only way to survive in this new economy we woke up in. Tam Pham wrote me. He said there's many ""Choose Yourself Meetups"" starting up in different cities. I didn't even realize how many cities. Koh Samui, Thailand?He said, ""can you promote the list of meetups?"" Because he knows that it's better for him, better for everyone, if more people are reaching out to each other and helping each other choose themselves and find their own dreams and create their own realities. Tam wrote the text for me. So I'm going to write it here: Ever since my best-selling book, Choose Yourself, was published in 2013, it has started a movement throughout many cities.If you're interested in meeting like-minded people that have used the philosophies in the book and chosen themselves in their lives, I welcome you to join these meetups groups and attend their upcoming events.1) Choose Yourself Meetup: New York, New York2) Choose Yourself Meetup: Massapequa, New York3) Choose Yourself Meetup: San Diego, California4) Choose Yourself Meetup: Bay Area, California5) Choose Yourself Meetup: Schaumburg, Illinois6) Choose Yourself Meetup: Deland, Florida7) Choose Yourself Meetup: Austin, Texas8) Choose Yourself Meetup: Houston, Texas9) Choose Yourself Meetup: Melbourne, Australia10) Choose Yourself Meetup: Manchester, United Kingdom11) Choose Yourself Meetup: London, United Kingdom12) Choose Yourself Meetup: Toronto, Canada13) Choose Yourself Meetup: Ko Sami, ThailandIf you want to start your own meetup, send an email here: info@chooseyourself.meYou can also join the Choose Yourself community on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/groups/chooseyourself.me/ where everyone shares ideas and resources with each other to improve our lives 1% each day.",2015-04-04T13:59:29.000Z

It was the middle of the night and I had nowhere to go. I left a message for the landlady. I tried to climb up the fire escape to see if I could sneak in but I'm afraid of heights. About two stories up, I froze. I couldn't move up or down. I was scared.Finally I crawled down. I sat down by the curb. Did the landlady get the message? I didn't know. All I could do was wait. Watch the cars go by. Smell the gas at the gas station next door. Or I could take action. Sometimes we can't take action. I could've broken a window and crawled in. Like they do in TV shows. But then maybe I would bleed and it would take a long time to repair my window because I was lazy and broke. Sometimes it's better to sit on the curb. And wait. And say, ""maybe she got the message"". Or say, ""I can sleep like this for now and tomorrow I can even stay with a friend if I have to.""Sometimes you have to give up.Quitter!It's not so bad to quit. Sometimes it's the most productive thing you can do to quit. So many times I felt like quitting things but I kept going until it was too late. Until a cliff was reached. Until I fell off the cliff. I know so many people who try and try and try even when all hope has long since left the room. Hope doesn't announce it when she leaves the room. She just leaves. I used to be in relationships where we both knew it was over a year in advance. Usually my fault. I didn't trust her. And then I would get paranoid. And then she didn't like my paranoia.And then I would trust her even less. And then, of course, bad things would happen. Sometimes it's not so bad to quit. Sometimes you have to trust yourself that things are painful now but if you take action, things can feel a lot worse.We're an action jackson culture. We want to move, to dance, to execute. ""Execution is everything!"" ""I take ACTION!""Or, if it's not working, we ""PIVOT"", we ""CHANGE!"" It's hard to just sit on the curb and wait for the landlady to show up with the keys in the middle of the night. ""DO IT!"" Break the window! I had a business. When the economy went south we went from profitable to unprofitable. Then someone was caught stealing from the business.Then we lost our lease.Then we lost all our customers. Then the CEO quit. They needed more money to survive. I was going to get squeezed out of the entire business even though I had put in a lot of money.If I took action, I would've put in more money.I didn't put in more money (because I was dead broke actually).The head investor called me into his office. ""We're all putting in money.It looks really bad that you aren't putting in money.""I blamed my now ex-wife. ""My wife says I can't invest any more. I'm in too many investments.""He knew I was lying. Smart people know when you are lying. And that was a pretty pathetic lie anyway. Blaming my wife on the 50th floor of a Park Avenue building filled with professional investors.Meanwhile, the bank was foreclosing on my house. Meanwhile, I tried to get another loan from the bank with the intention of leaving the country.Good thing I never took action. Good thing I just quit.Eventually I quit everything. The investment firm fired me. My old company that I had started fired me. I lost my house. I had to store almost all of my belongings to fit into the small house I moved into.I stopped talking to all the business people I knew. We moved far away. I never left the house and I gained 30 pounds. A friend of mine called me and I told him I gained 30 pounds. He said, ""ugh, and I remember you from before.""At what point in the rainbow does the red turn into orange.I'll never figure it out. But eventually it does. Eventually it changes but you can't pinpoint it. I started playing Scrabble at the local cafe. I met some good friends there. They are still my friends. I played backgammon with another friend who would come up from the city to visit me.I started to write. I wrote every day. I wrote two articles a day. I made new friends.I quit for about six months. And then I started to make some money again. And then I started to get excited about things again. Excitement creeps up. I feel it in my chest. Then my head. Then my legs want to wake up fast in the morning. I pitched a book idea. She said ""yes"". $5000 advance. YAY! Book advance!I raised money for another idea. It started to work out. I wrote down ideas every day of more things I could do. I started sending ideas to people and they would call me and ask me to help them. A year later I was getting paid more for my articles, my first book came out, I raised more money for my fund. I started another fund. I started thinking about doing another business.I was walking every day. I was writing ideas down every day. I suddenly had friends that I loved. I felt like I could be myself around them. That hadn't happened to me in almost seven years.I was grateful. When it snowed I was grateful. When my kids bought me a skateboard I was grateful. When I fell and flipped over on my first ride on it, I couldn't believe how happy I was when I was lying in the middle of the street and bleeding and both my daughters came running up to me screaming, ""Daddy, are you ok!?""I quit and I quit and I quit and at the time it seemed scary. Like if I enter the abyss will I get sucked to the bottom?I had to give myself permission to quit. Many times. Not just one. But I waited and I built up from the inside. And my inside changed. And then suddenly everything on the outside changed.I quit and I waited and I surrendered.Surrendering is action. Surrendering to what you can't control is the most powerful form of action.

I was eating cereal. Reading a book. In a few minutes I would go to school. She had just woken up. Walked into the kitchen. Saw me. Said her thing.Not the worst thing in the world. Not something you can't overcome.I was maybe 16. I liked a girl. I liked many girls. I wanted them to like me.One of my friends said, ""why don't you get contacts?""Another said, ""When are your braces coming off?""Another said, ""You just need to smile a lot. People like people who smile.""One time I had a cyst so big it covered the entire area from my eye, down the left side of my face, to the bottom of my nose. A big purple bubble that made my face look like a burn.Once a month my dad would take me into the city and a nurse would spend the morning draining the pus out of the cyst.Then I would spend the day at the arcades across from where my dad worked. Me and a bunch of kids from god knows where skipping school.My dad would tell me before, ""go anywhere but that arcade. It's dangerous in there.""But where else was I going to go? And it was dark. And it was fun. I was living inside a dream where the admission was free. One time I couldn't comb my hair before school. The brush just wouldn't go through my hair. I threw it at the mirror and told my dad I wasn't going to school that day. One friend of mine said, ""just wait for college. Things get better in college.""Ok.Ok.I'll wait.I started staying home every day. I never went out at night. I didn't have that many friends.My main friend I had in high school is now dead.At least, I think he's dead. Since nobody can find him on Facebook and google shows up with no results.I'm really bad at keeping in touch with people. I wish I were better. I wish I had a group of friends that we can sit around and laugh about our mistaken memories. Together those memories can form an ugly collage. When I started college I was afraid to leave my dorm room. I was afraid what people would think when they saw me for the first time.Gradually things got better. Things change.I didn't need braces anymore. Everything got a little better. I got a girlfriend although nobody could believe it.But you never lose that feeling of being someone nobody wants.The sort of person that girls whisper about. That guys come over to protect the girls. That girls run when you ask them out. I say that not because I was that ""sort of"" person but because those things happened to me.Does it get better? Yes. Yes it does. A lot better.For some people. I guess, not for everyone.When I lost all of my money (the first time) I felt the same way. Ostracized in the same way. Did it get better? Yes. Yes it did.But it doesn't always. Not for everyone.If you threw me into the street and took away everything I ever had or hoped of ever having, I know I could survive because I've done it before. And then I did it before that. There's one secret. The price of admission to a dream has not gone up. The cost of an illusion disappearing is still painful. Your ideas, given freely every day, are the installment plan. Build up your ideas. Share them. Help people. The secret: When you are kind to yourself, your ideas get better, you become an idea machine - it's like a super power- and the installment plan gets easier. I know this because it took me a long time to be kind to myself. To be the water, the sunlight, the soil, the love, that feeds the baby flowers ready to bloom.",2015-04-01T14:46:12.000Z
The One Technique To Determine Who Should Be In...,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/one-technique-determine-who-should-your-scene-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,9545,260,34,2015-03-31 00:00:00,9.0,"I want to be under water and float and not move.I love that feeling. Water completely surrounding me, I make every part of my body go limp. Thoughts rise up and create little thought bubbles above me on the surface.I don't like to think too hard. When I float, I enjoy thinking of nothing. Outsource my thoughts to the air. To future breaths.Asking for advice is like outsourcing your thoughts. ""Asking for advice"" seems weak.But it's actually the most powerful tool in your arsenal as a creative, an entrepreneur, a friend, a lover, a fighter.Advice is the world in another person's eyes. What a beautiful thing to see through everyone else's eyes.I was talking to Mark Ford the other day. He's helped build over 100 different businesses. Maybe more. When you create wealth for so many people you lose track.We went out to dinner. Everyone kept coming over to him and hugging him and saying to me while pointing at Mark, ""this is the real deal.""So ok.Mark told me many things. One thing he told me, struck like a clock.His partner, ""BB"", when negotiating, asks for advice at the beginning of any negotiation.Mark said, ""nothing has a specific value. Value is a range.""So BB has a technique. He asks the person he is negotiating with, ""Give me advice since you know your business better than I do. What do you think I should pay for it.""I thought at first. Ok, I like that. Get the other person to give a number first.But that's NOT the technique at all. It has nothing to do with the number at all! That's the water on the surface.BB already knows when he asks that question what his range is.When the person responds ,BB will say one of two things.",2015-03-31T14:00:47.000Z
Elon Musk Chose Himself: Here's How,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/elon-musk-chose-himself-heres-how-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,29119,747,85,2015-03-30 00:00:00,10.0,"Choosing yourself means taking risk, means not being afraid what people think, or your chances of success or failure. It means doing what you want and hopefully helping the world along the way. Because when you help others, that's how you get paid in a choose yourself world. Elon Musk is inspirational to many people, including me. Inspiration is somewhat of a risk: it takes you outside the world you once knew and introduces you to a new thought, person, idea, or something totally unexpected. I want to find Elon Musk's most inspirational quotes. The ones that might give clues to how each inspiration leads to the next. The ticking of the clock.Here's his quotes that most stuck with me. 1. If something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it.I often get stuck: what if something really is impossible?But Elon Musk then takes it to the next level always: ""let's go to Mars"". Or ""let's make a billion dollar battery factory."" So at the very least it's always worth exploring the delicious curvature of the impossible. 2. Going from PayPal, I thought: Well, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? Not from the perspective, Whats the best way to make money?I've interviewed over 100 people now on my podcast. Each of the 100 have achieved amazing results in their life. That's a subjective opinion.""Amazing"" to me. But none of them have done if for the money. I was talking to Coolio, for instance, who had the best selling song of 1995. He started writing lyrics every day in 1977. It took him 17 years to have a single hit. ""Never do something for the money,"" Coolio told me. ""Or the girls"", he added. 3. (Physics is) a good framework for thinking.  Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there.My guess is he is not referring specifically to the science and theories of physics but the act of visualizing something, coming up with an idea or a theory of why it might be true, and then figuring out how to prove that theory. To me, thats what physics is. Since the rules are constantly changing, which is another fascinating aspect of physics. Visualize a possible universe. Prove that it can happen. 4. The first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur.I wonder about this. What's impossible? Maybe a time machine is too hard to figure out. But to make an electric car you can imagine first a hybrid car that has a trunk filled with very efficient batteries so you don't ever need the gas part. Then it becomes a function of probabilities versus possibilities. 5. Its OK to have your eggs in one basket as long as you control what happens to that basket.Many people think entrepreneurship is about risk. In fact, it's the opposite. Good entrepreneurs don't learn by failure (the popular ""failure porn"" all over the Internet). Good entrepreneurs learn by solving difficult problems. Elon Musk controlled his outcome with X.com not by destroying the competitor but by merging with it (paypal). 6. Persistence is very important. You should not give up unless you are forced to give up.I always think this is the magic equation: persistence + love = abundance. You have to love something enough to persist. You have to persist enough to deepen your love. This is true for a career. True for a relationship. But only true for YOU and not what someone tells you to do. And then abundance is the natural outcome. Not just for you but for everyone. Since wealth comes to those who create wealth for others. 7. You want to have a future where youre expecting things to be better, not one where youre expecting things to be worse.This is incredibly important. News reporters have zero qualifications to inform people and yet they are all doom and gloom to sell subscriptions. But people who choose themselves... first imagine a better world and how to make the leap to get there. 8. It is a mistake to hire huge numbers of people to get a complicated job done. Numbers will never compensate for talent in getting the right answer (two people who dont know something are no better than one), will tend to slow down progress, and will make the task incredibly expensive.When I was running a software company, we always knew it would take one great programmer to solve a hard problem in one night versus 10 mediocre programmers taking a month to screw up a problem even worse. Ultimately, if you want to make a TV show, don't rely on the gatekeepers. Take a camera. Make a youtube video. Make 100 youtube videos. Now you have a show. All by yourself. 9. If you go back a few hundred years, what we take for granted today would seem like magic  being able to talk to people over long distances, to transmit images, flying, accessing vast amounts of data like an oracle. These are all things that would have been considered magic a few hundred years ago.And now imagine what it will be like 300 years from now when people look back at today. ""They had to actually 'connect' to an Internet then!"" or ""It took them 7 hours to get from NY to CA!"" 10. My biggest mistake is probably weighing too much on someones talent and not someones personality. I think it matters whether someone has a good heart.I recently watched a company go from a billion in revenues to zero when a founder stole $90 million from the company. Integrity, humility, and doing your best is by far the most important consideration when evaluating whether to work for someone. In order to choose yourself, you have to make sure you have completely surrounded yourself with others willing to take the same leaps. Else you will all fall into the ravine you are leaping over. 11. When I was in college, I wanted to be involved in things that would change the world. Now I am.I always wonder about the phrase ""change the world"". Can one person change another. Perhaps the most valuable starting point is to do everything I can to change myself each day: to be physically healthier, to be around emotionally healthy people ,to be create, to be grateful. To try and improve in these areas 1% a day. Then maybe I can have a head start on changing the world. 12. I think its very important to have a feedback loop, where youre constantly thinking about what youve done and how you could be doing it better. I think thats the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.I'm invested in about 30 companies. The companies that fail are when CEOs smoke their own crack. Technology, competition, customers are constantly changing. But we have a cognitive bias to think that the activity we have invested the most time in is, of course, a GREAT activity. What could be wrong with it? So it's important to constantly question this evolution-based cognitive bias with constant questioning as if one were an outsider looking in. Without that, businesses fail. And if you have trouble taking your own feedback, find someone you trust. Find an accountability partner. Ask: am I choosing myself? And when you find one...find a group. Have a meetup of like-minded people. Together, is how we individually choose ourselves.13. I wouldnt say I have a lack of fear. In fact, Id like my fear emotion to be less because its very distracting and fries my nervous system.A small level of fear is motivational. It forces me to have a backup plan. The average multimillionaire supposedly has seven sources of income. They all have backup plans. Even Elon Musk has Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity, and probably a dozen other companies he's peripherally involved in. Any endeavor I do, I always ask two questions: ""What is my plan B?"" and ""What is my evil plan?"" Meaning what do I hope to learn from this that nobody else expects.14. Life is too short for long-term grudges.I always think that I'm the average of the five people I spend the most time with. So this quote is important to me. Don't spend time with people who can even incite a grudge. I try to spend time with the people I love and who love me.Even when something bad happens, rather than blame, I try to think about what I learned. I don't want to make the same mistake again. It takes practice. I am very trusting. But I hope to learn a little each day.15. Dont be afraid of new arenas.Again, inspiration is a risk. It means stepping out of the comfort zone where you've never been before. I try as an exercise to figure out at least one thing a day to do that is outside my comfort zone. The other day I went up to people and asked them if I could buy a $1 bill with a $2 bill. Interestingly, everybody who was white avoided me. I was a lunatic. But everyone else took my $2 bill in exchange for a $1 bill.You never know what you find when you experiment. But it's always fun and scary and good practice for getting out of the comfort zone.16. I think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.I thought about this when I read it. I think it's ok for ""ordinary"" people to be ordinary also. Ordinary is beautiful. But I think every day it's worth trying to be a little better (1%, an amount so small it can't be measured) in physical health, emotional health, creativity, and gratitude. Maybe that is a path to extraordinary as that 1% compounds. But I don't want the pressure of ""future extraordinary"". I just want to be a little better today17. I could either watch it happen or be a part of it.Sometimes people say to me, ""I missed the boat"" or ""I am too late"". I think it's never too late to do what you love.What you love is always on the shore, waiting for you to arrive, waiting with open arms.18. Being an Entrepreneur is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of deathPeople say to me, ""I hate my cubicle. I want to be an entrepreneur."" Entrepreneurship is a disaster. 85% of entrepreneurs fail and failure is not fun at all. Not to mention you have to deal with customers, employees, investors - they are all your bosses and not the other way around. Then you have to sell, you have to execute, you have to build, you have to exit, you have to grow. I like Elon Musks's approach of having many things to work on. Many Plan Bs. So any one entrepreneurial endeavor doesn't take up all the mind space.One secret, though, to beat that 85%. If you start off with a profitably customer, the odds of failure go from 85% to less than 20%. 19. ""I would like to die on Mars. Just not on impact.""I highly recomend Andy Weir's book, ""The Martian"". He self-published it. Then it got picked up by a major publisher. Now Ridley Scott doing the movie. Discusses this very topic.20. On his favorite book when he was a teen, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"": It taught me that the tough thing is figuring out what questions to ask, but that once you do that, the rest is really easy.""Here's my favorite part of Hitchher's Guide to the Galaxy: the idea that all you really need from a materialistic perspective is a towel. Then the Universe sort of takes care of things after that. Hygiene is key.21. ""I just want to retire before I go senile because if I don't retire before I go senile, then I'll do more damage than good at that point.""The two most critical years in terms of dying are the year you are born and the year you retire. So I doubt Elon Musk will ever retire.",2015-03-30T13:58:21.000Z

I don't know why I asked. Maybe because she was making me coffee. If every morning someone asks you to make coffee, how can you love him?Maybe she would get tired of it. To be blunt: I would not like making her coffee every day for 40 years. She turned to me and there was the pause that comes between two lines of poetry. I just looked it up. There's a word for that pause. A caesura. Claudia spoke first a silent caesura. A search for the right words so everything can click. I should speak with more caesuras. ""I don't know,"" she said. ""40 years is forever."" And it's true. I look back at the last five years of my life. Even the last year of my life. Even yesterday. Who could've predicted? Questions are clothes with no bodies inside of them. Tomorrow is just a question. When I got puked out of the education system and stood on a corner of New York City near Chinatown I was waiting for the traffic light to turn. green This was 21 years ago.And so many people were coming at me. Beautiful people. Interesting people. All people I wanted to talk to and to touch.I was love sick for everyone who passed. Talk to me! And then I remembered being a kid and my parents loved me and suddenly I felt home sick. I feel home sick right now writing this. Imagine for a second being home sick. Where do you feel it in the body?I feel it a little in my stomach and chest and my eyes. Not a bad feeling. A homesick feeling. And then, right when I first moved to NYC, I remembered my girlfriend, 1000 miles away, and I felt sick for her. Why did I leave so fast? And I felt sick for everyone before her because I never thought of them anymore. Yet they were people who I had once confessed love to. And years later, after I had lost the last dollar that would pay my next month's expenses, I felt money-sick. A deep pit of hopelessness. The bottomless nothing.And I felt bad for my two babies that I had to support. And I felt bad for myself that I had gotten lucky and now the luck had run out. I feel bad now that at one point I thought it was luck and now I know it was only part luck. Part disease. Part skill. Part chemistry equation. This is the equation. This is the entire post: Persistence + Love + Health = Abundance. No professor ever wrote that on the board for me. How come?Every morning, before my first job, I would sit at train station at 5am with all the other sleepy people.I'm sorry now we all waited together and yet nobody spoke. The sun would soon overwhelm us, a lover for the day.People say to me, ""My life can really begin once I find my passion."" Maybe so. Maybe so. But passion often comes long after persistence explores every part of the maze. Creativity and gratitude and helping others, step by step, is what gets us through the maze. Those are the only things today that moves me one step forward in the maze. Standing on that corner in NYC 21 years ago. I had no passion. I was afraid to speak or to touch.I was lonely and hungry and nothing and I couldn't cross the street. I couldn't move at all. And I loved the sea of people moving around me, getting to their expectations as quickly as possible, and I was sick with all the possibility, and happy to be free of not wanting any one thing specific. I was in the desert and I had no water to give it. Nothing was predictable. I'm glad now nothing was predictable. And nothing has changed.",2015-03-27T14:16:24.000Z

Conan wanted to hire him as head writer of his show.Every step of the way in the 20 years since he put a challenge in front of himself that seemed impossibleand it was until he passed it. Now he's the best comedian ever. One can argue with that but one can argue about anything. He was offered the job of head writer at one of the hottest comedy shows in the world. He would've grown from that and be set for life. Instead he decided to hit the road. He went from gas station to comedy club to bowling alley to hotel to wherever to tell his hour of jokes. He talks in one interview about he loved to perform at proms. ""I would get booed by drunk teenagers even before I got on stage. If you can handle that you can handle anything."" He was already one of the best comedians in the world already in 1997 when I first saw him perform. But that wasn't the end of it. In the mid 00s he made a radical transformation to his act. Inspired by one of his heroes / mentors, George Carlin, he did two things: 1. CONSTANT CHANGE.He changed his act every year - ""January 1 I had no material."" He would start from scratch. This is incredibly difficult to do. To be honest, I don't quite know how to do that with my writing although I try. 2. AUTHENTICITY. He decided to leave behind the classic jokes of comedians (""what's my ethnic background? Here's how I make fun of it. Etc"") and talk more about his personal life. In 2010 I played some of Louis CK's jokes to my kids. His jokes were then about how his kids basically suck. My children were horrified. ""Isn't he being mean? What do his kids think?"" But it was funny. They laughed. And Louis CK doesn't tell those jokes anymore. Every year they get better. But that's not all Louis CK did after he turned down the job for Conan. 3.

I Prefer To Leave Early,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-prefer-leave-early-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,88360,1125,296,2015-03-23 00:00:00,11.0,"The woman had tattoos etched beautifully over her arms and told me the story of each one. Her husband owned the rights to 14,000 songs and told me the 20 year roller coaster ride of how he had acquired them. He owned the rights to almost all my favorite songs. I learned an immense amount listening to the two of them. Then I left even though the party kept going. I left early.When I sold my first business, it was because my sister in high school was learning how to do exactly what I did for my clients. I was charging $75,000 to do a 3 page website and now 13 year olds were doing it better and for free. Time to leave the party. It takes a half hour for the stomach to communicate to the brain whether or not it's full. Here's the solution: buy smaller plates. ""You'll eat 20-30% less calories"" says a future guest on my podcast. Someone on a post the other day said I should be ashamed for encouraging people to be ""not informed"". He's probably never been inside a real newsroom to see who is doing the informing. I leave the news early. I leave parties earlier. If I meet you in the street and say hello and fall in love with you, I'll probably leave early. I try to go to sleep early. I try to wake up early. If I do yoga I don't kill myself doing it. I'll do what I can and then leave early. If I'm in a meeting, 15 minutes is my deadline. Then I leave early. I'll just hang up and 90% of the time nobody on the conference call knows I'm gone. ""I prefer to leave early"" is my mantra. ""Prefer"" is there because why pressure myself into a ""Must""?Then there's the usual math. 15 minutes of ""leaving early"" every day adds up to about 3-4 years of extra love or work or art you can express per decade (assuming people work or fun or or create or love for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week). That's 3-4 years worth of quality time you can spend with people you love. 3-4 years worth of art you can create. I don't care what the ""art"" is. Make six second videos. Draw a picture of a house every day. Write a dumb poem. The dumbest poem possible. Here is an example of the worst poem ever: ---I prefer to leave earlyThat's why I'm never surlyAnd my hair stays curlyAnd even when I'm latePlease excuse meBecause I'll still leave early---I've spent much time in the past ten years coming up with many multiple streams of income for myself. I usually write about my failures. Because they are more fun stories. But maybe one sentence of success. I have about 15 different sources of income. Each one was difficult. I had to master each area. And then move on, else I'd be stuck with just one source instead of 15. I had to leave the party early on each one. I'm afraid to work for a boss. I'm always afraid I'll be trapped in a prison and have to do things I don't want to do. A boss is when you have one source. One person who can change your life with two words, ""You're fired"". I need to feed many mouthes. I feed the IRS. I feed my family. I feed my stress so I don't go crazy again in the back of a police car.Every stream of income requires a little bit of love and tenderness per week. Then...per month. Then...per year. Now I have time to write stupid poetry. Next time you go to a party. Maybe even it's a political party. Or a charity event. Or a dinner. Or a conference call. Or a sales meeting. Do this:Find the most valuable, fun, creative thing you can learn as quickly as you can. The one thing that will add value to your life. Hone in on it FAST. Learn something.Then leave. Even in a sales meeting: if you learn from the customer, the customer will buy from you. Even on a first date. Get the kiss. Leave early. It gets better later if you leave early today.Someone said to the great pianist, Artur Rubinsteain, ""I love the way you play the notes!"" Artur Rubinstein said, ""Ahh, the secret is how I play the silences between the notes."" The real you is the silences between the notes. Not the you in the meetings. The talking you. The worrying you. The you trying to please the date or the boss or the trolls. The you that HAS to respond! I try (sometimes not so successfully. Sometimes horribly) to play the silences in between the notes. How many things can you leave early today? Be honest about it. This is the only gift we were given when we were born. The ability to leave things early.Without the silence, we would never know how to distinguish a beautiful sound.",2015-03-23T13:38:39.000Z
The Ultimate Guide To Self-Sabotage,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ultimate-guide-self-sabotage-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,25922,531,142,2015-03-20 00:00:00,10.0,"I've given up right before the finish line. It's not as bad as people say really. It even has a nice ring to it. French. ""I'm a self-saboteur"". Maybe I'm a spy. Like, right when you are about to make a lot of money, or finish a book, or get a job, or whatever, you can't take it anymore and you just give up. It's too much. Take drugs or have a lot of sex instead. Enjoy. Who am I to judge?For one thing, once you give up you take off all the pressure of being a ""winner"". Who cares anyway? I once wrote the software for a company that I was going to split 50-50 with a guy. This was 20 years ago. I wrote the software. Well, I wrote almost all the software. I gave up. Too much work. I wanted to play with girls. Now it's a thriving business. It's a fun consumer-oriented website. I'm a free member for life. He's made millions. Ok, that happens. I am happy for him. When it comes to self-sabotage I'm an expert. If anyone needs advice on how to self-sabotage themselves I am here for you. I can even open up a clinic maybe. I'll wear my labcoat. People will come in and say: I'm about to sell my company, or my book looks like it's going to be a bestseller. I'll say, Whoah! Hold on there cowboy. Let's take a step back. And then let's take TWO steps back. Just sit back down hombre. Space is for astronauts, you know what I mean? There are so many great things about self-sabotage, depending on who you are. More cheap and fun relationships? Or maybe just lying in bed and reading more books. I don't know. You and I, we'll figure it out together. Here's the most common kinds of self-sabotage I've either seen or I've done myself. You are welcome to all of them. I've even been addicted to self-sabotage. And I've had the best enablers. I'll admit I hope I'm over it now. But once an addict, always an addict. I see them everywhere, every day. Not a day goes by I don't see it among even my closest friends. A) CONTROLLet's say you have a great idea. An idea that will change the world. It's brilliant. You can make a billion. Maybe ten billion. But not everyone is good at everything. I'm not good at filling out my taxes, for instance. Thank you Richard M. Gabor for helping me with that. I'm not good at driving. Thank you Miss Claudia Azula Altucher for helping me with that. I'm not the best businessman. But I have many many mentors who help me with that. Thank you. Always say Thank You is what my mamma taught me. When you have one piece of a puzzle but someone has another piece of the puzzle, then you have to let them help you.But they want 95%!? I called Chet the day after the Netscape IPO in 1995. I said to him, can you believe this BS?He said, what are you talking about? Marc Andreesen, who wrote the software, only ended up with like 5% of the company. Jim Clark and James Barksdale got a lot of the rest. J-j-j-James, hold up there, Chet said. Without those guys this software would never have left the lab. And now he's rich anyway. Great ideas happen to individuals. But great executions happen in groups. Another BRILLIANT example is with PayPal. Peter Thiel (Paypal.com) and Elon Musk (X.com) were going head to head and destroying each other through competition. How did they solve the problem? They merged. When PayPal finally sold to Ebay for $1.5 billion, Peter Thiel, the FOUNDER of PayPal had just 3% of that. Did he care? Of course not. He took 1% of what he made and invested it in a tiny website called Facebook. B) LEAKSI was once at a poker table in Las Vegas during my ""year of poker"". I played poker for 365 days straight, every day, every night, including the night my first daughter was born. I'm not proud of it but if I worried about every way someone could judge me from 16 years ago I'd be a scared man all the time. One guy at the table, maybe the best player there, said to me, ""I have one leak. Women."" In other words, he makes his money, and then he spends it all on prostitutes instead of saving up his bankroll and really making a play for the big leagues of poker. Be honest. What are your leaks?. Maybe you fall for too many people. This is an addiction also. I am too trusting. I often have to rely on others to help me figure out who to trust. Maybe you drink too much. Or read junk news too much. Maybe you think the finish line was earlier than it really was. This happens to me a lot. I think, ""Ok! I'm married. I don't have to focus on this relationship any more!"" Often it's in those final 10 yards in a 26 mile marathon that the race for gold really begins. But most people don't know that. I learn that over and over because I'm an addict. Every day I have to remind myself. C) BLAME SOMEONE ELSE (EXCUSES)This is the worst. It's nice and easy when something goes wrong to blame someone else. Why would one blame others? It's nice when things are not your fault. That's one reason. Another reason is jealousy. If the rich are oppressing the poor, then they are easy targets to blame and could explain why one is not rich. ""I would never want to do what they have to do!"" ""MMmph!"" (Stamps foot down!)Or maybe everything would've worked out but you made a poor decision when you hired that guy. That ONE guy that screwed it all up! ""He seemed like a good choice. How could I know??"" There's a two-step solution to blame: a. It's your fault. It's always your fault. b. Have a Plan B on every decision. If you follow ""a"" you'll never waste time being angry with someone else. They have their own issues. Now they need you to be angry at them?If you follow ""b"" then whatever bad happens, you have a backup plan. It's not always easy to have a backup plan. That's why very few people win the gold medal. D) BLAME DOOM &amp; GLOOM""It was the housing bust!"" That cost me my house. Then my family. Then my job. Then I couldn't get a new job. Then I got depressed. Then I had to take medication. Then and then and then! BLAH! Every day there's bad news. I've worked for enough newspapers to know that the news is bad for a reason. It's not like there's only bad news happening. But they only REPORT bad news. Picture you're in the jungle. To your left is a donut tree (I love donut trees) and to your right is a lion. Which one makes your brain light up more and pay attention. The newspaper industry knows that you will pick up a paper that has a lion on it that is about to eat you. If you're American then you certainly aren't hungry so the donut tree can wait. ""It's Obamacare!"" ""It's the government bailouts!"" ""It's Greece!"" I like the last one. Everytime Greece is in the news every stock investor I know loses money because ""It's Greece!"" and then you turn on TV and people even uglier than me are talking about Greece like it's a Hiroshima on the economy. Then they forget about it for awhile (""it's Ebola!"") and then it's back in the news again. Solution: Macroeconomics is largely a myth. It's just an extra thing to study in college so they can justify charging you $40,000 a semester. Even politics is a myth, particularly in the West. How much has a President really moved the needle on your life. If you're in the army (i.e. you work for the President) then they might move the needle. But largely the President, the Congress, some judges, etc maybe move the needle 5-10% on your life only once in awhile. So ignore it all. People say, ""but don't you need to be informed?"" About what? I can't really think of anything I've ever been informed about that has significantly changed my life. I like to focus on the things I love, not the things I'm informed about that disappear tomorrow. E) ENTITLEMENTI am happy to say I have never fallen for this. Only because I've seen others fall for it a lot. So when I see it happening in me, I shut up. ""I'm better than this! I deserve to make $X"". And that ruins everything. All visions, all bigger pictures. It ruins it for everyone who backed you and supported you in the past. It ruins it for your boss, who now has to fire you. Entitlement is the same as the word ""ceiling"". Once you feel entitled to X, then X is your ceiling. Nobody is entitled to anything. A great example is Louis CK. The man is the greatest comedian alive (you have to admit top 10 even if you disagree with me). He was offered to be the head writer for Conan in the early 90s at $500,000 a year but he turned it down. How come? He wanted to be a comedian. He went on the road. He shot a movie. He kept pitching his own shows. He kept improving his skills. Not over a period of months but over a decades. In the mid 00s he even had a show on HBO, ""Lucky Louie"" (also starring a recent podcast guest, Jim Norton). It got cancelled. Then he pitched another show to CBS. They rejected it. Finally he pitched a show to FX. He didn't give up like, ""they NEED to give me a show. I'm the best!"" Now it's one of the best shows ever on television. And he's my hero. If at any point he had given up because of feelings of entitlement he never would have created the work of art he now does and gone on to higher heights as a comedian. Oh man, long post again. What the heck? Can't I just make a list like everyone else does and keep these down to 300 words or less? I forget who said it: ""I'm writing a long letter to you because I didn't have the time to write a short letter"". So ok, I will just list the other ways people self-sabotage. F) COMPLAININGG) GOSSIPINGH) FEAR OF CONFRONTATIONI) THE WORD ""CAN'T"" Ok, I need to comment on this one. If someone says to you, go be the best pianist in the world, you might say, ""i can't do that"". That's fine. That's a normal ""Can't"". I'm not a big believe in ""Can't Porn"" - this idea that you should NEVER say ""Can't"". But so many people take something simple: like ""self-publish a book ever month or so and make an extra $1000 a month"" and say ""I can't"". Why can't you? Did you try the 20 times that are necessary to get good at something? Did you study all the books on self-publishing and the techniques of the people who did? Do you have to be 8 feet tall to self-publish? Can you stop watching TV for one hour a day so you can do your full time job and write your book on the side and at least try? It's your heart's desire but you're so afraid of failure that you don't even want to make the attempt so you can continue to live with the illusion, ""I could do it ...if only I can't do it."" ??Roosevelt could've said, ""I can't. I have polio."" Hawking could've said, ""I can't. I can't even move!"" Thomas Edison said, ""I can't. It didn't work the first 999 times. It will never work."" ""Can't"" is the jealous lover of ""Persistence"". J) NOT MY THINGWe get labels early on. I'm a mathematician not a businessman. I'm a dancer not an actress. I'm a programmer, not a salesman. I'm a pretty girl, not a physicist.Richard Branson could've said, ""I'm a music guy not an airline guy."" Elon Musk could've said, ""I help people on Ebay buy baseball cards, I can't blast a rocketship into space."" Steve Jobs could've said, ""I'm a computer guy not a music/phone/movie guy."" JK Rowling could've said, ""I have to take care of my kid. Not write a fantasy novel with unknown prospects."" Maybe these are just anecdotes. Benjamin Franklin could've said, ""I run a printing press. I don't know anything about lightening."" Albert Einstein could've said, ""I'm a clerk in an office. I don't know anything about the time-space continuum"".",2015-03-20T13:32:06.000Z
What Four Steps Make You The Exception To The Rule,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-four-steps-make-you-exception-rule-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,7195,214,57,2015-03-16 00:00:00,9.0,"Here's the Rule: born, school for 12 years, college, grad school, job, sowing oats, marriage, kids, promotions, luxuries, retirement, death. Here's the Fact: the Rule never happens. Here's the Sadder fact: People who believe in the Rule will get depressed and disappointed. Even at a young age: ""it's too late for me!!"" Which is to say: there's an exception. Which is to say: the exception is to be exceptional. I don't know how you can be exceptional. I'm the last person to give advice. I'm the guy who last week was an unlicensed driver crashing on an icy road into a snow bank with my 12 year old next to me. I'm the other guy who has failed in 17 out of 20 businesses. I'm divorced. My mother doesn't speak to me. But here's what I try to do. And I guess it's better for me than not doing it. OVER PROMISE AND OVER DELIVEREveryone says ""under-promise"". Don't do that. Don't be that guy. The obvious liar. It's so obvious when people under-promise. In a group of ten people, nine will under-promise. Be the person who steps forward instead of backward. When I sold stockpickr.com to thestreet.com I had very ambitious goals for traffic. They didn't think I would meet it but they would be happy if I did. So I created a Q&amp;A portion of the site that many people got obsessed with. Traffic doubled within a month. I over-delivered and they were able to put ads on every page. Not that I was so great. I got depressed about six months later and stopped showing up. Don't tell them but someone else wrote all my articles (2007). I never was good at working for someone. But at least the product I sold them kept humming and still is.  HAVE A VISIONIt was 1994 when I was at HBO and nobody had a website.Whenever I tried to convince people to go on the ""world wide web"" my boss's boss's boss would tell my boss, ""please get him off this internet stuff. The internet is good for academics but not cable guys."" Christmas weekend I took all of their databases (including the kitchen menu) and made an intranet and then put Netscape on every desk. Then within a year I was running their website. Then a year after that I had a company on the side creating websites for other businesses. I was a very bad businessman. I should have stayed unprofitable, raised money, gone public, cashed out. But instead I made websites as cheaply as possible for all of our clients. When you have a vision it makes you bigger than your job, it makes you bigger than the company you start, it makes you bigger than the people who buy your company. The way to get a vision is to read as much as possible, and then dig inside and see what excites you. Write down ten ideas every day. Buried inside those ideas is your vision. Self-publishing excites me, for instance, right now. And batteries. I wish my phone battery would last forever. Oh, and I have a vision that I'm the best comedian ever. I doubt that will happen. But hey, I have to try. HONESTYI don't believe in radical honesty - where there is no filter between your head and your mouth. Don't tell your wife's friend's sister you want to have sex with her for instance. The Bible starts: ""In the beginning was the Word"". That's all we have that defines us to other people. Our words and our actions. Do we do what we say we are going to do. Or do we slander? Do we gossip? Do we try to play politics. Be the source. When you go to Google, Google is honest: ""I don't know anything about motorcycles but I've done a lot of work and I think these ten websites can help you. And, by the way, three of these websites are paying me to tell you that."" And then what website do you then return to when you want more advice? Google. Become the person everyone comes back to. Because they know what you say is fair and honest.  MOVE FROM AMBITION TO MEANINGWhen I was in my 20s I wanted to make a lot of money and have a lot of girlfriends. Those were my ambitions. Oh, and I wanted to write a novel because I thought it would get me the other two. Then I spent my entire 30s in a vast black hole confused by an indulgence in all the things I was ambitious for. ""Meaning"" takes you from simple pleasures to helping others. Then you feel real well-being. How do you find meaning? Stay healthy, have friendships that are positive, write down ten ideas a day, and be grateful. This is the mother of meaning. Everyone has time for the above. Everyone has time to be a superhero. WHAT ARE THE RESULTS?  YOU BECOME COMPETENT at the intersection of vision and meaning. You will get good at what you pursue. You will always know how to get good at what you do. YOUR NETWORK GETS LARGER. Because you are the source of integrity and competence they can trust. And they know you have their interests at heart. People are skeptical of this. I put a book on Amazon for 99 cents once (the lowest price they will let you) and someone gave me 1 star and said, ""I love Altucher's writing but I can't believe he's selling out."" For 99 cents. People can't believe when someone steps out of the ""straight line"" out of ""the rule"". When you are the exception, the other 99 out of 100 will tear you down. That's ok. Let them do that. In 80 years all 99 of them will be dead.  YOU GET HEALTHIERThere's only seven million scientific studies on this. All you have to do really is: sleep 8 hours, laugh a lot, be grateful, and your brain gets better and you get healthier.  YOU FEEL BETTERYou don't have to feel ""happy"" all the time. I don't feel happy most of the time. Sometimes really bad things happen. I live right by the Hudson River. From my house I can see it. Sometimes the river is stormy, sometimes calm, sometimes all ice. But I can still stand there and watch it. I don't have to swim in it every day. Being able to watch the river of emotions that swirl past you allows you to take good and bad situations with equal tranquility. This allows you then to keep pursuing your life of meaning instead of being swept away by the tides of anger and fear and envy and even ecstasy.  WHAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEYI only learned this by repeatedly not having any money. I only learned this face down in the gutter. I don't mean to engage in failure porn. This is actually a success story. This morning I'm emailing back and forth with a guy who gave up his cushy high-paying job to become a dog-sledder because he loved it. In 2006, I was constantly sick with worry about money. But when I started doing something I Ioved (stockpickr.com) I never thought about money (well, not for another two years). When you're the source, as much money as you need flows towards you. And as the meaning and vision in your life gets larger, your network gets bigger, you become abundant. YOU BECOME KINDEvery single person has struggles. If you say, ""give me your list of complaints"" to anyone and force them to focus on it (me included) the list can go on for ten pages. But complaining is draining. Complaining only takes away energy from today and never solves the problems for tomorrow. Instead, spend that time being kind to the people around you. Treat everyone as if it's their last day alive and they don't know it. My guess is that will solve most of your complaints, whether it seems that way right now or not. Will this turn you into a Steve Jobs? No, probably not. This will turn you into a You. You don't need to create a music player to save the world. When you die, nobody will say, ""thank god he was angry and bitter all the time"". People will say, ""I really benefited from his kindness."" Not that life is all about death. But maybe it is. That's the only thing we are aimed in a straight line at.",2015-03-16T14:05:09.000Z

It happened and I'm going to tell you how.Everyone says that technology right now gives more opportunity than ever to ""choose yourself"". That only now we have the opportunity to escape the cubicle and live a life of freedom. This is not true. Freedom starts with the choice inside yourself. Not the choices outside. These 500,000,000 books were mostly sold in the 1920s, 90 years ago.Opportunity always exists. All it takes is an imagination.Knowledge is a tiny subset of imagination. You get enough knowledge to understand the tiny box the world wants to keep you inside of - then imagination is the entire universe outside of that box.The Little Blue Books started by Emanuel Haldeman-Julius were tiny blue books of classics and original material that were sold for 5 cents each. There was no gatekeeper. He didn't try to sell the books through a publisher. He didn't try to sell books in a bookstore. He went straight to the masses.

Screw The Paleo Diet!,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/screw-paleo-diet-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,202615,918,371,2015-03-06 00:00:00,12.0,"I'm feeling bad about the Neanderthals. But for $30 million I can buy one. Seriously. Since we mapped the Neanderthal genome, for $30 million I can now find a surrogate mother (Claudia Azula Altucher?) and a professor at MIT can, I don't know, inject a Neanderthal into her womb.Or something like that. Something science. Here's some science: school taught me that neanderthals were a different species.But you can't have kids with a different species. That's the RULES that define ""species""!But now it turns out we all have somewhere between 1 and 5% Neanderthal in us. Which means kids happened.Which means a Neanderthal woman kissed a human man. Maybe, at least once, a Neanderthal said to a human, ""I love you."" Which means maybe violence happened. And a baby was born. And then something bad happened.All of this is to say: Screw Paleo. Screw paleo diets. I'm so sick of the paleo diet.All of this is to say: the paleo diet is a lie. And yet it's not quite. More contradictions.I used to eat cereal for breakfast. Two bagels for lunch. And pasta and wine for dinner. The All-Carb diet. I miss those days.Now I try to be ""paleo"". You can't eat anything. Peanuts? Forget it. I tried to get away with popcorn (""it's mostly air""). Forget it.Gluten-free? Believe it or not - that's not paleo. Check for gliacin. If it's got that in there (to get the ""gluten"" effect) then it's even worse.Ezekiel bread? Puke! What does it even mean that it is sprouted bread? Is it like a bread plant?Fruit? Forget it. Too much sugar. And I hate vegetables and meat. I can't eat anything.I don't know what the answer is or what the right diet is.Important: here are the areas where the most people aged 100 or over live: Okinawa (rice-based diet), Sardinia (pasta), Costa Rica (maize / corn). All live off of starch-based diets and very low animal food.Here's the argument for paleo: that for 3 million years, homo sapiens and their ancestors didn't live off of wheat.We were nomads and foragers and ate anything we could find: plants, bone marrow, nuts, rodents, whatever.It was only a mere evolutionary blip ago (10,000 years) that wheat basically domesticated us.Important: the success of a species is not determined by it's happiness but by its ability for its DNA to replicate itself.Unfortunately, humans are not the winner. Wheat is.Around 10,000 BC, give or take a few thousand years in various parts of the world: Wheat took control of the human race and forced us to settle down and grow it.What? Wheat.The results have been a total disaster for humans accept for the fact that we now have croissants to eat. Mmmmm. And French Toast and Pancakes.Now that we have to protect our vast quantities of croissants we had to settle down into cities and kingdoms. We have to pay taxes. We have wars. We have religions. We burn down forests to grow the wheat.Lots of good things.Diet interlaces with lifestyle. You can't separate them. THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO LIVING PALEOA) FOODI was talking to Nassim Taleb about the paleo diet and he reminded me of one important fact: humans didn't eat a nice three meals a day spread out every 4 or 5 hours.Sometimes we'd go for a day without food simply because we couldn't find any. If you want to eat paleo you have to randomize the time you eat.We probably also ate different things every day depending on what we found that day.Nuts, plants, marrow. Marrow!Do you really think it's likely we killed a cow and then some lion waited in line while we ate first?We were LAST in line when it came to eating the meat so we probably ate more marrow. Marrow is soft and mushy and comes from inside the bone of an animal.It's also about 96% fat. So if someone tells you to stop eating fat you can tell them that's basically all humans ate fat for three million years.The longest living ""cousin"" in the homo genus is the homo erectus which lived about 1.5 million years (I think sapiens have only been around 200-300,000 years). There's no photographs but I really can't imagine that members of homo erectus were obese and lying around watching ""House of Cards"".Let me just say: you know that chart that shows chimps on one side, then chimps slowly evolve into humans by standing up straight? There's like 5 steps in between. I'm somewhere in the middle. I'm always sort of jealous or envious when I hear there was once a species named Homo Erectus.Erectus! Back to the real paleo diet: the health benefits of eating bone marrow? Boosted immune system, helps cancer, improves digestion, improves the brain, and on and on.Do I eat bone marrow? Hell no! But I guess if it was on the menu I'd try it. I probably should. A Bone marrow brioche sandwich. Here's what I look for in a diet:",2015-03-06T16:04:59.000Z
The Ultimate Guide To Changing Your Life,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ultimate-guide-changing-your-life-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,21025,380,95,2015-03-02 00:00:00,10.0,"Ugh, then there are those times when I feel dead inside. I wake up early and swing on the pre-school swingset like a pervert. The sun rises and instead of being orange and blue and beautiful it's white and glaring and it's a terrible terrible sunrise, burning everything inside of me.Another day.This is what happens to me when change is being born. At least for me: I've never avoided any of these steps. A) SOMETHING'S MISSINGYou don't know what it is. But it's like you left something at home. Maybe the stove on. Or a book you were supposed to read. Or a key that opens a door you forgot about.It's a bloating. A constipation of life that just won't get digested until it wears you down, makes it hard to move, forces your face closer to the grind that will kill you.When I spoke with David Levien he told me about his commute to work. Seeing the people asleep or reading the paper and he felt that sense of being bloated. The feeling of ""Will I fall asleep?"" So on the commute he wrote a page a day of what became a bestselling novel.Albert Einstein was dying from the rigid eight hour day at the patent office. He was so bored he was even denied his first attempt at getting a promotion. He would try to dig out the crevices that time had carved into his routine so he could work on his own theories of magic, since the magic of today always becomes the science of tomorrow.I was told all the time in my 20s, ""you have to pay your dues"". I was told this by people with some higher rank than me. As if they had paid their dues. But one man's rank is another man's stank.You pay your dues when you finally come to that realization that something is missing.That whatever they told you in the past: your religion, your parents, your friends, your bosses - is wrong. Not for them. Since who knows the price of another's life.But for you.The ""dues"" are when you find your authentic voice. The singing voice that stands out in the world chorus. ""Paying the dues"" is when you open up that voice to its full range.When you sing.B) DESPERATIONI realized something was missing but didn't know what to do.I thrashed. I would read books. I would see which people I would want to model myself after. I would study them. I'd write ideas down each day. I'd cry because these were the times I was most lonely, when one group was disappearing and another set of friends and colleagues had yet to find me.Trust that the desperation will go away. You'll find people to love. You'll write ideas down every day. I finally learned to be grateful for my desperation. This is the egg that will crack open and give birth to new life.It's going to happen many times. Even every day. Go forth and multiply.C) TOTAL CONFUSIONWhen you speak in that authentic voice for the first time, you say words you never said before. Maybe nobody has ever said them. You're going to scare the people around you. You're going to scare yourself. Because people close to you will react. You might be wrong. When you write the first page of the novel, you can't possibly know how it will end. When you start a business, not a single person in the world can predict the outcome.Odeo is always my favorite example. Started by a guy who had built a hundred million dollar company previously. Everyone trusted his idea was good. A platform for podcasting. Huge idea!Many great investors invested. But no customers. One of his employees started a side project. Sending messages back and forth. He got 10,000 users. A small amount. The founder offered all of the investors a chance to get their money back. 100% of them accepted. The founder then changed the name of the company to the side project.All the best investors in the world missed out on investing in Ev Williams' new project, Twitter.The world is changing very quickly. In a few years, your 3D printed car (your 3D printed food) will be dropped off at your house maybe every month. Companies like Coursera and Khan Academy and Udemy will destroy overpriced colleges. AirBnB will end the need for hotels. New technologies in batteries will end our reliance on the pervasive ""grid"".There's no answer. There's no guru who can say what will happen. I've started 20 businesses and watched and cried while 17 of them failed. I'm divorced and have lost two homes. Many friends I love, no longer love me. When the tide shifts, it's too hard to figure out what companies will go down with it. I've seen many billion dollar companies fail within a matter of weeks or months. The only thing common among all of them: lack of character at the top.You build character by remaining calm in the confusion. Sometimes I haven't been able to do this. One time my mother said to me, ""I can't believe you are my son."" Character is a hard thing to cultivate. At least for me. But it's possible for everyone. This is also called, ""Paying your dues"".D) SELF-SABOTAGETwo different friends of mine are self-sabotaging themselves right this second in two very different companies.I can't tell them because what do I know? But they will do it. When I was a kid, the world's record for losing the most amount of money in one day was held by a young man named Ross Perot. If I remember right, in 1969 he lost a billion in a day when the stock market fell.He said much later, ""Most people give up just when they're about to achieve success. They quit on the one yard line. They give up at the last minute of the game one foot from a winning touchdown.""I didn't used to believe in self-sabotage. I thought that was an excuse. But now I see how it happens. You're so close but you're afraid to take the chance and disappoint people. You say later, ""I was just being honest"" or ""I couldn't take the chance"".I self-sabotage myself all the time when I'm afraid to disappoint someone else. Or when I'm not honest about my real feelings and desires I tend to mix them up so badly until it's all a big mess. Or when I think I don't deserve the good fortune that I've worked for.Why wouldn't I think I deserve it? That seems fake. I have no clue. But it's true. Somewhere deep inside there's a hole and it can't be filled except by sabotage. Recognizing it, noticing it, working around it, is the third step on the path to change. E) ANXIETYThe other day I had to give a talk. Everyone was smart and successful and knew more than me about the topic of the conference.What could I teach them? How could I start to get their attention?A friend of mine is working on a company that has a technology for detecting what part of the country every strand of marijuana comes from. He explained some of the science to me. I mildly misinterpreted it to start my speech.""Did you know marijuana plant has both a penis and a vagina,"" I started my talk with. And then explained what I meant. Then related it back to the topic: marketing. People laughed. But I had been afraid.I died in another talk. Everyone in the audience was very successful. So I gulped down a can of coke but didn't swallow the coke. Instead I walked on stage and pretended to throw up. Dead silence.I have to go to a big meeting next week. I am helping a company and maybe millions of dollars are at stake. Will I look too weird? Will I have nothing to say? Will I say the wrong thing?Anxiety is the doorknob. The doorway leads to change. But you have to open the doorknob first.F) SOMEONE LISTENSDavid Levien wrote his book on his commute. His best friend read it and loved it. Kay Cannon wrote her script on the subway over three years. A studio then made it into a movie.Einstein slaved away in the patent office and wrote ""e=mc squared"". A physics journal decided to publish that equation from a third level patent clerk.Frank McCourt, now a bestselling author, wrote his first book in his 60s. His memoir, Angela's Ashes. Someone agreed to publish it.Guess what? 35% of entrepreneurs last year started their first business at the age of 50 or older.Lisa Gable had never started a company before. At the age of 70 she got disgusted with her falling bra-straps. She made a bra strap that help everything up. Strap-mate, now a multi-million dollar company.Coolio wrote lyrics every day for 17 years in a row before having a single hit. Someone finally listened. Somehow his voice stopped imitating others and became his own. At some point you've paid the dues and everything begins to pay off. You begin to get that return. People listen. You stood out and everyone hated you but then fight through that and now you begin to have an impact.G) SLOW DOWNWhen you find your voice, slow down. There's no rush. Out of six billion people, you're the only one with your voice, your experiences, your ideas, your wisdom. There's no competition to be you. Someone once complimented Arthur Rubinstein on his piano playing. He said, ""It's not the piano playing. I handle the notes no better than anyone else does. It's the pauses - that's where art resides.""When your change kicks in. This is the moment not to plan for the future, but to find the pauses in the present.This is what makes or break the person who surfs the world of change. Too often I rushed into the future and fell off the cliff, with all my limbs broken.I wish I had done this: respect the pause, respect the people around me, respect that I have to write down ideas every day, be grateful that I got to this step. Gratitude fights the gravity that tries to pull you down and prevent you from taking the next step.When you slow down, everything lasts longer.H) EVERYTHING CYCLESWhen I follow my own advice, my life changes almost completely every six months.But often things go really bad. A few months ago, a company I was involved in fell apart. There was corruption. Things got ugly. I was so disappointed. I didn't see it coming. I hit a low point. Low points and high points happen in every creature on the planet except in our Facebook feeds.You have to know in a low point that it's time to rest a bit. At a high point you act. At a low point you rest.This doesn't mean turn on the TV. Turning on the TV turns off the rest of the world. Do the opposite. Turn on the rest of the world by being with people you love, finding the gratitude that is ALWAYS buried in difficult situations, writing down ideas every day (one in 100 might even be good).I was at a low point and had a hard time getting out of bed. Until finally I told myself, this is the perfect time to follow my own stories. And so I did. And then things got better. I wrote 20 things I learned from the experience. I figured out how to turn the death of this psychic murder into the birth of a new life for me.I) FIND YOUR TEACHERSWhen you change, it's like you've walked through a portal and entered a new world.In this new world, you need teachers to show you the way. You can find your teachers in real life. You can find them through books. You can spy on them and model your life after their examples.Everything that happens to you, every person you encounter was sent specifically by the mad scientists who created this virtual reality to teach you. Their methods are insidious and not out of the standard textbook so you can't be fooled. But learn.Eventually you pass them as you further develop your voice, as the world now becomes something not that you entered but something that you impacted and changed. Now it's your world and you are the teacher.J) REPEATIt never ends.",2015-03-02T16:11:56.000Z
The 10 Worst Things You Can Do In A Negotiation,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-worst-things-you-can-do-negotiation-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,101033,1768,320,2015-02-27 00:00:00,12.0,"The best negotiator I knew always acted like an idiot. He acted so well that I thought he was really stupid. I also thought at the time that he was my best friend.That was probably an act also. Just two years later he stopped talking to me forever.I ran into him in the street the other day. He smiled and shook my hand. I felt warm, like he liked me again. Then he was gone.Negotiation is first about warmth. Two sides deciding if they want to be friends with each other. If they want to be in the same tribe, fighting side by side in this harsh world.After that it's about vulnerability.

Usually I wanted money or sex and I felt passion would get me those. But in those low moments I felt I was a failure and undeserving. For instance, I thought if I published a book I would be happy .. and get money and sex. Or if I became a millionaire (one MILLION dollars!) then there would be the trickle down theory of happiness.Ugh, so wrong. What a fool I am!Life cycles. So when you see yourself in a low point: start with the below and the rest follows (sex, french toast, smiling, money, and maybe some passion).Don't forget that when the lights come on inside of you, everyone in the world can see a little better.Good bye and good luck. I do these three things:A) INNER ACTIONSWhat you do on the inside effects your brain and chemistry and blood and DNA much more than anything you can do on the outside.I know many people who decide they will never be happy again. Never make money again. Never find romance again.And, of course, there's no way to argue with them. It's often hard to listen to them. And eventually you avoid them. They will prove themselves right.This is not law of attraction. Money doesn't rain down on the lucky (mostly) or the optimistic. But it certainly doesn't arrive at the doors of people who barricade their houses.And it can't happen if you are stuck in bed. Or bloated with the enormity of your problems. Or satiated with the tiredness of your daily routine.",2015-02-23T14:16:48.000Z

I had one company that failed on me this week. Really painfully, ugly puke-failed me. Or I can tell you about the other company that I sold this week. Selling a business is 90% personal and only 10% business. Maybe I can tell you about the company I'm about to start next week. I'm excited about it but starting a company is brutal. It's a maze until you find the cheese at the end.Everything is a bit too fresh. I don't know how I feel about them yet.All day yesterday I was on the phone and I had to switch from mindset to mindset. That's hard on my brain. Sometimes I'd get on the phone to talk about the company I was starting but I was still feeling like someone had just shit in my mouth because I had just been talking to the company that was failing. Sometimes I'd be talking about the company I was selling and everything seemed so hopeful but then there would be a stumbling block in the deal and I'd have to figure out how to jump as high as possible to get over that stumbling block. Every deal in the world has stumbling blocks. That's why 90% of companies fail. People don't realize that there's idea, execution, selling, and then... closing. Closing is often the hardest. It's where everyone is deluded into thinking things are done, that the sky is all blue from here on out, but there's still one more blizzard/tsunami to get through. I don't know, it's all too close.

10 Things I Learned From Richard Branson,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-things-i-learned-from-richard-branson-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,54443,1266,259,2015-02-16 00:00:00,11.0,"The other day I went out at night and fell asleep on a park bench near the beach in Miami.When I opened my eyes I pretended I had just landed on the world. I knew nothing. Now I had to learn everything.That's the way I should've been when I was younger. Maybe I would've avoided many problems if I just realized I knew nothing.ALL SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE started off knowing nothing.They studied the people who came before them. Who studied the people who came before them. And so on.I really admire Richard Branson. He's one to study.Richard Branson is the perfect example of ""Ready. Fire. Aim."" He starts something. He does it. Then he looks to see if he hit the target. If not, he starts something new.I love the story of how he started Virgin Airlines. He was already successful from Virgin Music. Note that now he has nothing to do with Virgin Music.I don't even know if Virgin Music still exists. All that is left is Virgin Air.A plane had gotten cancelled. Everyone was upset.But Branson wasn't upset. He found a plane that would take him. But he didn't have the money.One good thing to start with always is to imagine the obstacles gone. Imagine, ""if I wasn't worried about money, would I still make this trip?""I call this IDEA SUBTRACTION. Subtract the perceived obstacles to an idea and (BAM!) you find that many more ideas are born from that.First, he arranged to rent the private plane, even though he still had the obstacle (""no money"").Then he put up a sign: ""$29 for a plane to Puerto Rico."" And everyone signed up. Suddenly he had the money for the plane.That was his proof-of-concept for an airline.

The Ultimate Guide To Being A Pro,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ultimate-guide-being-pro-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,9900,322,62,2015-02-13 00:00:00,9.0,"Whoah! What just happened? I woke up the other day and I was 47 years old.I remember when I was seven years old. 40 YEARS AGO.I ran to the bathroom but I was too late. I peed all down my pants and everyone laughed and I had to sit in class wrapped in towels.Disgusting!They all made fun of me. ""No hard feelings,"" but all feelings are hard. It's the hard feelings, good and bad, that we remember, that define the moments of our life. I was an amateur.Another time I was involved with a company where I didn't realize one of the founders was a criminal. I figured, ""it's because he's crazy that I have this opportunity"" else who would give me an opportunity. Why me? I had no confidence. That was amateur hour.I was greedy. Greed breeds poverty. Saving the world breeds success. The second you think about the money, you stop being a pro. Here is what I think it takes to be a pro. Be simple, be humble, be curious, be fascinated, be passionate, have a vision. All of that is good as you rise from amateur to pro. But none of it will bring you to the other side. Where the dragon hides the gold. A) DON'T OWN THINGSI don't mean, ""throw everything out"". Recently, Claudia and I did that. It's not like it's so great to do that. But suddenly, objects don't have as much hold on us, holding us to the ground, to a place, to a memory, to a fantasy. I think it was Einstein who made the joke, ""if a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind then what does an empty desk mean?""I'm fine with that. I'm fine with having an empty head. Leaves me weightless. Let's me fly. B) NO POLITICSI was talking to Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, and he told me that he likes to write about topics where if you take either side, then both sides will hate you.For instance, pro-choice vs pro-life. If you can make a reasonable argument for both sides, then both sides will hate you.War vs ""No war has ever been justified"". I have lost friends over this one. If you can If you say, ""no war can ever be justified"" then almost every race and ethnicity will hate you.Global warming versus no global warming. Both sides will hate you if you argue a reasonable case for both sides.C) DROP BAD FRIENDSI kissed her even after she cheated. I shook his hand even after he stole. I cried because I cared about her after what she did. It's hard to give up on people. But we're each on our own path. The paths intersect but they never merge. Intersections are powerful explosions but some of them burn out. The pros know when to move on.D) LOOK SHARPSeems stupid but it's true. Seems stupid coming from me, but it's true. I once called Steve G when I was in tenth grade. On a scale of 1-10, I asked him, do you think any girl will ever like me?I had glasses, braces, acne, I never brushed my hair, and for some reason I liked to wear two button down shirts at the same time. Maybe to bulk up.He refused to answer. He said, ""maybe wait until college"". ""No hard feelings"". I don't know if I ever improved. But looks also convey confidence, happiness, laughter, freedom. You want to look in the mirror and see freedom. E) A JOB IS A SMALL PLACESo many people fight for that last promotion. It's like the last helicopter out of Vietnam. The jobs are going. But one leap and...Assistant VP of Sales while everyone else is left behind.Only... it's a myth. You can't get wealthy at a job. Everyone hates you. Your only friends are people you meet at a water fountain. And then there's the next promotion...And then there's entrepreneurship. Don't be fooled by that myth either. 85% of businesses fail. And those are the ones started by pros. So how do people make money? By coming up with ten ideas a day. And out of 3,650 ideas a year, trying a few of them each year and never stopping. F) FIND WAYS TO LAUGHToday: Jim Gaffigan, Amy Schumer, and an episode of ""Episodes"" and a book by Kurt Vonnegut.Everyone who lives over the age of 100 says, ""I laugh a lot."" I prefer that advice to the people who cry a lot and die young.My father cried a lot. He would call me while crying. He would cry in the super-market. He would cry at parent-teacher conferences. And he died young. I miss him. I would call him when everything was going wrong. His optimism was so creative and stupid. He always knew how to build me a fantasy path from the wreckage I was in, to a rainbow. I'm sorry I didn't talk to you your last six months. But you always gave me a reason to believe in hope. Nothing wrong with crying. It's just not as good a habit as laughing.G) BE CREATIVECreativity is double-edged. If you are creative for awhile and then stop, it feels very painful. Your brain feels constipated and it hurts. You can only be creative when everything is working right on all cylinders: physical emotional mental spiritual. If you are emotionally blocked, you'll be creatively blocked. And so on. But when the spigot turns on the whole world is filled with art. This is how you sharpen the knife. The world becomes soft clay. You cut into it. H) NEW PEOPLEA week ago I spent the day on the set of a new TV show being filmed. I learned from the director, the writers, the actors, the extras, the assistants. How did I get there? Because of a friend of a friend of a friend. I forget how I even met the first friend. I just kept pursuing new people, and then their friends, and so on. I watched how the director set the tone of the entire show by how he shot the scene. I felt like a little boy with a new toy. I was giddy. I watched for seven straight hours the director filming the same scene over and over. I'm 47 and that was a brand new experience. Today I've already had one brand new experience. It was actually a horrible one. And I expect tomorrow I will have another one. Maybe it will be better. But it will be new. I) BE A CLOSERPeople think ""Closing"" is the same as ""Selling"". It's not. That's amateur hour. When you sell an idea, a product, a concept, a company, then the work truly begins. Then you go from selling to closing. A totally different skill. You have to hold hands every step of the way. You still have to keep the big mutual vision alive. You have to keep everyone hungry.And you also have to handle all the tiny dotted ""i""s and crossed ""t""s. You have to be big picture and microscopic picture.Amateurs do one or the other and are blind to the other side. They don't even see it exists. Pros do both.I think after 20 years of trying to learn to do this I'm probably a ""6"" on a scale of 1-10 although every day I'm shown more areas where I'm an amateur. J) NEGOTIATION IS A MYTHMost people have no clue what negotiation is. It's not about getting more money, or a higher percentage, or extra perks.Negotiation is the art of making both sides equally happy (""1+1 = 5!"") and equally nervous (""there's a lot of work left to do. This is just the beginning!"").When you negotiate with only one side in mind (""I want to be happier than the other side"") then both sides will lose. A pro is a good negotiator.K) ABH. Always be HonestOne time I pretended to be nice to an entrepreneur I didn't like - Josh J. I told Mark K I didn't like Josh.Then I had to go to dinner with Josh but he had already spoke to Mark.So that was awkward. He brought it right up and was smiling. Laughing at me. ""No hard feelings."" When you lie, here's what happens:a. everyone finds out anyway and you're the fool in the middle.b. your life splits in two and it's hard to keep trackI used to live a triple-life. Women, jobs, drugs. Much easier to suck the drama out of the outside world and put that creativity into your inner world. Then the seeds blossom.I) DON'T BELIEVE IN STORIESKim Kardashian is famous because 70,000 years ago we needed to commit genocide on Neanderthals.Humans were moving from Africa to Europe in bigger tribes than ever and there was no way we could know everyone in the tribe.So gossip was invented. ""Mark says Jack is a good hunter so since I trust Mark, I now trust Jack"".That's the invention of gossip. 70,000 years later...Kim Kardashian.But when tribes got bigger than 150 we needed something bigger: storytelling.If you and I believe in the same story, then we are more likely to trust each other. Religion, nationalism, corporatism (""Go IBM!""), and even rooting for the same team, make us more likely to trust each other. They are all stories. Almost everything is a story. But we're still learning that. It's only been about 30,000 years of storytelling and 3 million years of being a species.So an evolutionary blip. And when storytelling breaks down, wars result. The trust breaks down. Better to understand from the beginning that everything is a story. Live the real life and not the story life. The only real story is being around people you love. Helping them with their dreams. Pros help others. Pros make the team better. Pros score the points.I'm mostly an amateur. There's nothing wrong with that either. There's too many things to be good at to be good at all of them.I'm still learning. I hope. I no longer pee in my pants as much. I learned how to wait and be patient. But I'm always going to miss my dad. The best amateur I ever knew.",2015-02-13T14:10:33.000Z

What is the Definition of Success?,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-definition-success-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,14415,279,106,2015-01-26 00:00:00,10.0,"I thought I was done with the hard work of being a human being. I sold my first company for $15 million.Phew! That was hard. I thought after that that I was done. Time to drink and do everything else that is bad.Done!Got a few people pregnant. Lost all my money. Lost my home. Done!This happened to me a few times. I sold a company in 1998. I sold a company in 2004. I sold a company in 2008. Wasn't this my goal in life?Each time, I felt like I no longer needed to keep up the facade of being healthy. I was now a success. No longer did I need to work for success. I WAS success.But then...bad. And once-friendly faces would stick out:""I knew it!"" or ""I told you so!"" or just ""I hate you and will make you punish!""People will not hesitate to punish you.So many people on their own layers of hell, eager to see someone fall past them so they know, beyond certainty, that there are hells deeper than the one they find themselves in.So what then, is success. Because it is not money. And it is not some physical achievement. It's not a book written, or a reward received or a job completed or a promotion anointed.Here are the stages of success that I think exist. I can easily be wrong. This is what works for me now.Success has no definition. It's a myth. No microscope can dissect it.Stages of fake success: GOAL. You've created something of so much value to the masses that the value gets reflected back to you.People look up to you. Money is showered down. This feels like success. It really does feel real good. Like super-cocaine. Success crack.But, one might say, donuts can be perceived as creating value for the many. So many people might get pleasure from your donuts that your ""success"" knows no bounds.In the long run donuts make you sick.So this definition might be suspect. HAPPY. You're happy with spouse, job, place, your private creative achievements.You wake up and the birds sing. You're happy.But we all know we age. People die. Creativity always carries on its back the weight of the criticisms all too eager to pile on. So this success is fleeting and hence suspect. HEALTHY. I always advocate a daily practice: every day attempt to improve just 1% along physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual pillars.But I'm afraid. Something can always go wrong.What can go wrong to the people I love today? What anonymous strangers will reach out and attempt to strangle me today?I get almost every day letters from someone who promises to get me for implanting a chip in his brain and controlling him with secret technology.Is it success if we are physically emotionally mentally spiritually healthy? If we improve those areas by 1% each day?I think that's closer. But I still don't know. What's wrong with ""no improvement"". Why do we put the guns to our heads to improve?Such pressure! PRESENCE. Most of my life I time travel.I've spent much time in the future analyzing the possible alternatives and being afraid of everything bad about to happen.I've also spent valuable hours in the past, replaying, rewriting, regretting.""But you have to focus on tomorrow,"" people say, ""so today you can best prepare for it.""I'm staying in a house right now where the owner has a cute pad of ""Lists"" - every day she writes her to-do, grocery, bucket, life, etc lists.But no matter how many items are on our list, we can only do one thing at a time. The rest is just possibility.I can worry about fifteen things, but worrying will only weaken my energy for today, and do nothing to solve the problems of tomorrow. No matter what those problems are. FREEDOM. Some of us are in prison. Some of us are in man-made prisons, Every excuse is a brick or a chain.""It's too late."" ""I have no time"" ""I have no education"" ""I have no connections"" etc.Some of us are in self-imposed prisons, ""if I don't do THIS then I've FAILED"".We're the only jailers of these prisons. The doors are always open.We open the doors by lowering our expectations. We walk out the doors when we realize how easy it is to exceed those expectations.In a universe filled with a trillion galaxies and a trillion more years, there is no anointed goal that, when accomplished, will cause you to shout, ""Success!""Doing the best we can this moment is success. It brings about all the other stages of success described above.The only way to have a successful tomorrow, and a successful life, and a successful legacy, is having a successful moment right now.I can't claim to do it. I try and usually I fail. Success is not meant to be every second. Else, how would you know what to compare it to.Be gentle to yourself. You're a little baby and someone needs to cradle you and whisper to you and love you.My daughter just published a story on fanfiction.net. It's anonymous because she doesn't give a shit.

Why Entrepreneurs Should NOT Buy Homes,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-entrepreneurs-should-buy-homes-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,73359,647,361,2015-01-23 00:00:00,11.0,"Many people have said to me in the past few months, Im going to buy a home. Or, What do you think of the idea of me buying a home? Everyone thinks: Well the housing crisis is now over so I should buy a home. They think: Its probably a good investment. They think: Time to put down roots.Ive owned a home. A couple of times. I bought a home once after I sold a business. I then lost that home. I then went almost completely insane trying to sell it. Two things: If you are about to do a startup or if you are in the middle of startup-phase then you definitely cant afford to waste the time or money to buy a house for reasons I explain below. Second, when you sell your startup  everyone wants to buy a house with the proceeds. Dont. Its just part of the American mythology. You know the myth: the white picket fence, the yard, the pool, the walls that you can paint, the keeping up with the Jones family. Just dont. Youll go broke. At least, if you are as stupid as me. I might be dumber than most though.The other story I have of owning a home is still too personal. Its filled with about as much pain as I can fit onto a page. Oh, I have a third one also from when I was growing up. But I dont want to upset anyone in my family so Ill leave it out. Oh, I have a fourth story that I just forgot about until this very second. But enough about me. Lets get right to it.There are many reasons to not buy a home: Financial:A) Cash Gone. You have to write a big fat check for a down payment. But its an investment, you might say to me. Historically this isnt true. According to Robert Shiller from Yale, in Irrational Exuberance, 2nd edition, inflation-adjusted housing returned 0.4% from 1890  2004. And thats just housing prices. It forgets all the other stuff Im going to mention below. Suffice to say, when you write that check, youre never going to see that money again. Because even when you sell the house later youre just going to take that money and put it into another down payment. So if you buy a $400,000 home, just say goodbye to $100,000 that you worked hard for. You can put a little sign on the front lawn: $100,000 R.I.P.Much better for an entrepreneur is to invest in yourself. Take 1/20th of the down payment amount. Start a business. Your investment might go to zero (which it might also do with a house) but it might also go up 10,000%. Eventually, as an entrepreneur, if you are persistent enough, you will get one of those 10,000% returns. And you will be able to be persistent because you didnt waste all the money and time that a house wouldve cost you.B) Closing costs. I forget what they were the last two times I bought a house. But it was about another 2-3% out the window. Lawyers, title insurance, moving costs, antidepressant medicine, therapy. It adds up. Two- to three-percent. Do you like flushing your money down the toilet? But, people say: isnt that what you are doing with rent money? Absolutely not. See below.C) Maintenance. No matter what, youre going to fix things. Lots of things. In the lifespan of your house, everything is going to break. Thrice. Get down on your hands and knees and fix it! And then open up your checkbook again. Spend some more money. I rent. My dishwasher doesnt work. I call the landlord and he fixes it. Or I buy a new one and deduct it from my rent. And some guy from Sears comes and installs it. I do nothing. The Sears damage repair and my landlord work for me.When you are an entrepreneur, two things: A) you need every last dime for your business. Not for your dishwasher. And B) you need every last second for your business. Not for your dishwasher.D) Taxes. Theres this myth that you can deduct mortgage payment interest from your taxes. Whatever. Thats a microscopic dot on your tax returns. And guess what, that whole thing about how rent will go up with inflation? Well your property taxes will go up even faster than inflation. So you lose.E) Youre trapped. Lets spell out very clearly why the myth of home ownership became religion in the United States. Its because corporations didnt want their employees to have many job choices. So they encouraged them to own homes. So they cant move away and get new jobs. Job salaries is a function of supply and demand. If you cant move, then your supply of jobs is low. You cant argue the reverse, since new adults are always competing with you. Thats one reason for the myth. The other reason is that we have a 15 trillion dollar mortgage industry. Thats a lot of money vested on you believing that owning a home is the right thing to do.And, the benefits of being an entrepreneur is that all choices are open to you. Mobility is not just an option, its often a necessity. You arent tied down to one factory. The world is your opportunity.F) Ugly. Saying my house is an investment forgets the fact that a house has all the qualities of the ugliest type of investment: 1. Illiquidity. You cant cash out whenever you want. 2. High leverage. You have to borrow a lot of money in most cases. 3. No diversification. For most people, a house is by far the largest part of their portfolio and greatly exceeds the 10% of net worth that any other investment should be.Investing in yourself is also illiquid. But it involves less money, and allows you more choice. So do that instead.Personal reasons to not own a house:A) Trapped, part 2. Some people like to have roots. But I like things to change every once in a while. Starting March, 2009 I was renting an apartment directly across the street from the New York Stock Exchange. It was fun. Id look out the window and see Wall Street. How exciting! Before that I lived in The Chelsea Hotel with Chubb Rock. Last year we decided to relax and move a little north. Now I look out the window and see the Hudson River. And its quiet and I can walk along the river in the morning with no noise. It took us two weeks to pick a place and move. No hassles. I like to live a hassle-free life.Im constantly involved in other activities that I care about and love. What do I want the hassle of owning a home for? What if, god forbid, I want to focus on my next start-up?B) Walls. You cant change the walls when you rent. A lot of people seem to want to tear down walls. Or paint them. Sometimes when you rent you cant do these things. Well, make sure you have a landlord that lets you tear down walls. There must be some ancient evolutionary tic that makes us want to tear down walls or put nails in them or paint them. I dont get it. I like the walls to stay right where they are.C) Rent. People will argue that the price of the mortgage, maintenance taxes, etc is all baked into the price of rent. Sometimes this is true. But usually not. And often maintenance and taxes will go up faster than your rent.D) Psychology. Look at your personal reasons for wanting to own. Do you feel like you cant accomplish something in life until you own a house? Do you feel like its part of getting married and Settling down, i.e. creating a nest for your future children? For you, is it a part of becoming an adult. Is this what your parents taught you? Examine the real reasons you want to own and make sure they are coming from a good spot in your heart.E) Your time. Do you really want to spend all that time working on your house? Is this where your time is best spent towards creating a happy and fulfilled life for yourself?F) Choices. I feel when I rent I always have the choice to leave. To live wherever in the world I want whenever I want. Adventure becomes a possibility even if I never take advantage of it.G) Stress. For me (not for everyone) owning a home equals stress. I saw what my parents went through at their worst moments owning a home. I saw what I and others went through in the Internet bust when I first owned a home. I saw what people went through in 2008. People were killing themselves. I dont like that sort of stress. This is how I deal with stress. H) Cash is king. I like cash in the bank. I like having access to it. I dont like it all tied up in one illiquid investment. I want to fill a bathtub with all the dollar bills I wouldve used as a down payment on a house. I want to bathe in that bathtub. Im going to do that later today in fact.By the way, this is going to sound like a contradiction: but I think housing is a great investment right now. I think housing prices have gone down far enough and I can list the reasons why housing as an abstract investment concept is going to go higher from here. Suffice to say there are many stocks/REITs you can buy, with leverage if you want to take advantage of the rise in housing. But those are liquid investments. You can get your money back.Theres also probably many companies you can build where you will get 10,000% returns where you can take advantage of the rise in housing that is about to occur.But Im never going to buy a home again. And sit there in the middle of the night thinking, Why the hell did I do this to myself again?",2015-01-23T15:14:46.000Z
The Only Two Secrets You Need To Know,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/only-two-secrets-you-need-know-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,31736,368,106,2015-01-22 00:00:00,10.0,"A few years before he wrote Freakonomics, Stephen Dubner wanted to follow me around. To shadow me so he can find out how depraved I was.""I'm writing a book about the Psychology of Money. You're going to be the first chapter."" He wanted to write about someone who made and lost millions and psychologically was a total wreck.He came to my ""house-colding"" party. I was losing my house in NYC and about to move 80 miles north to the only place I could afford. A house 1/3 the size. We were all depressed at the party. Well, my ex-wife said, this is it, as the elevator opened for the last time. My oldest daughter was crying. The house was empty. Stephen was writing in his notebook.Then he came and visited me upstate a few weeks later in our broken down house at the time. We started playing Backgammon. We began a match in 2002 that is still ongoing. It's a match of matches. We play to a 100 each match. I think the score is 2-1 in my favor but he's about to make it 2-2.He stopped writing on this book because his article about an economist in Chicago got very popular and he got a book deal because of it.The day before Freakonomics came out, Stephen was depressed. ""I don't know what I'll do if this book doesn't work out,"" he told me while we were playing.""Don't worry,"" I said, ""it will be a bestseller."" I had read a copy. I had no idea if it would be a bestseller or not. I was just being nice.A few days later he calls me up. ""Look at the Amazon number.""Holy S&amp;&amp;&amp;! It was #2. #1 was a Harry Potter book. For the next year or so or three, Freakonomics was #2 or #1. Going back and forth.I don't think there's been a non-fiction book like that since. So consistently in the top 2. After that it was a franchise: two more books, a game, a movie, a blog, a radio show, a podcast.I've read and re-read all the books. But I've probably read the first book over ten times. I think I know why it's a success. And I think the two reasons why it's a success can be applied to business, relationships, writing, all creativity. Everything.#1: AHA!There's an example in the second book of how monkeys learned how to use cash to pay for sex. The first case of animal prostitution?That's an AHA! It's not enough to say ""monkeys learned how to trade"". This would be interesting, but not ten times as interesting as any other fact about monkeys. But sex and monkeys and prostitution is ten times as interesting. It's an AHA!In the first book, they break down the economics of a crack gang and explain why so many crack dealers live at home with their mothers.This is an AHA! It's not like saying ""Crack dealers end up in jail more than other types of drug dealers"".What is an AHA! moment?It's saying or doing something that is ten times more than expected. As an example, Daniel Kahnemann has written that after someone makes $75,000 then their happiness starts to even out if they make more than $75,000.A non-AHA moment would be, ""that's not true. It depends on where they live."" That might be a smarter way to put it but it would not be AHA!AHA! might be that after $1,000,000 a year people become more and more miserable. And that $10,000,000 a year they become suicidal.I'm not saying that is true. Who knows? I'm just saying that's a ten-time addition to the original statement.In business, you can't offer a ""cheap Uber"". That's a small improvement over Uber. Who cares? What would be interesting is if Uber can pick up my laundry and groceries and even my prescriptions at the pharmacy. That's an AHA!I went to Best Buy to get a new phone this year. The upgrades were so meaningless that for the first time in ten years I didn't get a new phone. No AHA! But if they told me, ""the battery life lasts for two weeks instead of one day"" I would've paid any amount of money.In relationships you can't be slightly more handsome or interesting than her last boyfriend. They broke up for a reason!You have to show where you are 10 times better. If the last guy never returned her calls, then you can write love letters AND return calls. AHA!As Steve Martin once said when his career was taking off, ""be so good they can't ignore you.""In anything you want to be good at, go for the AHA!, not the HO-HUM.#2: Secret OriginsMy favorite comic book as a kid was a DC comic called, ""Secret Origins"". Each issue was the secret origin of a different superhero.It's not enough to know that Batman is a good detective and is rich. It's important to know that his parents were killed right in front of him.He's probably psychologically disturbed and constantly seeking revenge so he wears a skintight suit and gets pleasure beating people up.In Freakonomics, they don't just present a bunch of bland research. For every scientist whose research they discuss, they first get right to the heart of what the scientist's personal story is:why was he interested in monkeys who pay for sex? Why is he interested in the amount of methane gas that cows give off. Why is he interested in the IQs of people who spell their names wrong?What was Stephen's secret origin? When he was nine years old singing in a Catholic church choir with his religious parents, his dad collapsed of a heart attack and died.Then he realized his parents had converted from Judaism and he started exploring this new religion for him - perhaps an abstract quest for the parent he lost.The book that resulted, ""Turbulent Souls"" became a bestseller.When Stephen was following me around, he called all my relatives and people I had worked with to find out who he was following, but from their perspective.If something (a business, a relationship, a book, a character) is important to you, find out who they are. Don't ask them WHAT their work is. Ask them WHY their work is. Ask them WHO their work is. Ask others about them.Find where they are most disturbed because that fissure in the surface is where the earthquakes will come from.",2015-01-22T14:17:50.000Z
The One Secret For Doing A TED Talk (Or Any Talk),https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/one-secret-doing-ted-talk-any-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,72297,443,84,2015-01-19 00:00:00,11.0,"Giving a talk is the worst thing you can do to your body. First off, you want to pee, crap, and puke right before you go on stage. In other words, your body thinks it's about to die.Second, I convince myself I'm totally worthless as a human being so I start crying and Claudia has to find me and convince me I'm wrong.So that's when I break out the only method that ever works for me. All the time, every day, I'm either laughing or crying. I prefer laughter.Even the women I've been most attracted to always made me laugh. One woman from 20 years ago constantly insulted me but the insults were so quick and funny I couldn't help being attracted to her.But she was a mean person to everyone and somehow people could just tell. One time we were just walking in the street and a homeless guy walked right up to her and spat in her face.""Holy shit!"" she said, ""go after him!"". But there was no chance that was happening and she broke up with me.I've already written that before I give a talk I listen to standup comedy.James Science: it triggers the mirror neurons in my brain and helps me to relax, and maybe mimic how they work their voices and bodies, and helps me to connect better with the audience.",2015-01-19T14:20:51.000Z

I know this because, using the scientific method, I cupped a glass against the wall, put my ear against it, and listened.I moved the glass around the wall until the sound was the most clear.One question: we spend $800 billion on killing children in Iraq but we can't figure out how to bottle the sound a woman makes when my glass is against the wall of her room.A man sounds like a grunting animal. I don't know if this is sexist, but a woman is music.They woke me up, but it's ok. They are always welcome to do that. I'm in an AirBnB and today is my last day.

The Truth About What It Means To Be Successful,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/truth-what-means-successful-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,35446,568,167,2015-01-12 00:00:00,10.0,"I thought I was done with the hard work of being a human being. I sold my first company for $15 million, and I knew I was finished with all the hard work. I had achieved a goal.But goals are man-made. And in one lifetime we will have many goals. And our small brains have never developed the capacity to understand what goals are in our own best interests.Imagine someone slapping their hands to clean off the dust of hard work digging in the fields all day. ""All done!"" as he claps his hands and waits for the sun to set so he could enjoy the festivities.Dancing maybe. Or drinking. Whatever. Done!Success dresses up for Halloween and pretends to be that moment. That moment when you've accomplished your BIG thing and you think that's all there was to it, this sojourn here on the planet  finishing the big thing and saying, Done! I did my job as a human.This happened to me a few times. I sold a company in 1998. I sold a company in 2004. I sold a company in 2008. Wasn't this my goal in life?Each time, I felt like I no longer needed to keep up the facade of being healthy. I was now a success. No longer did I need to work for success. I WAS success. The living embodiment of it.But within months, or sometimes even seconds, of giving up on that slippery grasp we all hold on to called ""Improvement"" I would fall Fall FALL. Down through the inferno and each layer seeing the faces laughing, ""I knew it!"" or ""I told you so!"" or just ""I hate you and will make you punish!""People will not hesitate to punish you.So many people on their own layers of hell, eager to see someone fall past them so they know, beyond certainty, that there are hells deeper than the one they find themselves in.Success is a cheap god that gives you pleasure for a second before sticking the knives in and throwing you out of heaven.So what, then, is success? Because it is not money. That I know. And it is not some physical achievement. That I know. It is not a book written or a reward received or a job completed or a promotion anointed.Here are the stages of success that I think exist. I can easily be wrong. This is what works for me now. Just like a single thought can't be captured by a test tube and studied under a microscope to dissect it's essential elements, nor can success.Stages of success:Goal. You've created something of so much value to the masses that the value gets reflected back to you, like a reflection in a pond on a clear day.People look up to you. Money is showered down. This feels like success.But, one might say, donuts can be mistakenly perceived as creating value for the many. So many people might get pleasure from your donuts that your ""success"" knows no bounds. So this definition might be suspect.Happy. You're happy with a spouse, job, place, and your private creative achievements.You wake up and the birds sing. You're happy. But we all know we age. People die. Creativity always carries on its back the weight of the criticisms all too eager to pile on. So this success is fleeting and hence suspect.Healthy. I always advocate a daily practice: Every day attempt to improve just 1% along physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual pillars.This has been the only thing that has worked for me when I've been at my lowest points  whether divorce or bankruptcy or a single email criticizing me.But in the pit of my stomach right now is a tiny clench of anxiety about who will I meet today.Who will I reach out to today. What value will I bring today. What can go wrong today.What can go wrong to the people I love today? What anonymous strangers will reach out and attempt to strangle me today? (And that might sound paranoid, but even last night I got an email from someone claiming I've implanted a chip in his brain and he will ""destroy"" me if he has to.We have bills to pay. We have children to feed. We have people to touch. The world never ends with a bang but slides like a snake from one day to the next.Is it success if we are physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually healthy? If we improve those areas by 1% each day? I think that's closer. Don't forget to live in the present.Presence. Most of my life I time travel.I've spent much time in the future analyzing the possible alternatives and being afraid of everything bad about to happen. I've also spent valuable hours in the past, replaying, rewriting, regretting.""But you have to focus on tomorrow,"" people say, ""so today you can best prepare for it.""I'm staying in a house right now where the owner has a cute pad of ""Lists""  every day she writes her to-do, grocery, bucket, life, etc. lists.But no matter how many items are on our list, we can only do one thing at a time, and the rest is just stress of the future.I can worry about 15 things, but worrying will only weaken my energy for today and do nothing to solve the problems of tomorrow. No matter what those problems are.Freedom. Some of us are in prison. Some of us are in man-made prisons, forced to do what we don't want to do to feed our families and stay alive. Some of us are in self-imposed prisons, ""if I don't do THIS then I've FAILED.""We're the only jailers of these prisons. The doors are always open.We open the doors by lowering our expectations. We walk out the doors when we realize how easy it is to exceed those expectations.Learn what you can. Live what you can. Provide the value you can but just for this moment.In a universe filled with a trillion galaxies and a trillion more years, there is no anointed goal that, when accomplished, will cause you to shout, ""Success!"" That's a myth.Doing the best we can this moment is success. It brings about all the other stages of success described above.The best way to have a successful tomorrow, and a successful life, and a successful legacy, is having a successful moment right now.I can't claim to do it. I try and usually I fail. Success is not meant to be every second. Else, how would you know what to compare it to?Be gentle to yourself. You're a little baby and someone needs to cradle you and whisper to you and love you.Then do the best you can. Right now. And if you can't, then when you can. No self-judging. Maybe that's the best success.The pressure to have a goal, to have success, will take you further and further from success.Be gentle to yourself this moment, and stand in awe of everything we can't possibly understand.",2015-01-12T14:32:10.000Z
Why 2015 Is The Year You Have To Change,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-2015-year-you-have-change-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,15235,572,146,2015-01-09 00:00:00,10.0,,2015-01-09T14:12:17.000Z
What I Learned About Life After Interviewing 80...,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-i-learned-life-after-interviewing-80-highly-people-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,278950,3123,795,2015-01-05 00:00:00,13.0,"""You interrupt too much,"" people email me. ""Let your guests finish talking."" But I can't help it. I get curious. I want to know! Now!Over the past year I interviewed about 80 guests for my podcast. My only criteria: I was fascinated by some aspect of each person.I didn't limit myself by saying ""each one had to be an entrepreneur"" or ""had to be a success.""I just wanted to talk to anyone who made me curious about their lives. I spoke to entrepreneurs, comedians, artists, producers, astronauts, writers, rappers, and even this country's largest beer brewer.Will I do it for the next year? Maybe. It's hard.Sometimes I would pursue a guest for six months with no reply and then they would call and say, ""Can you do right now?"" and I'd change all plans with kids, Claudia, business.I had no favorites. They were all great. I interviewed Peter Thiel, Coolio, Mark Cuban, Arianna Huffington, Amanda Palmer, Tony Robbins, and many more. I'm really grateful they all wanted to talk to me.Podcasting, to be honest, was just an excuse for me to call up whoever I wanted to call and ask them all sorts of personal questions about their lives. If I wanted to talk about ""Star Wars,"" I called the author of a dozen Star Wars novels.If I wanted to talk about Twisted Sister, I called up the founder of the band. If I wanted to talk sex I called the women who ran the ""Ask Women"" podcast.I wanted to know at what point were they at their worst. And how they got better. Each person created a unique life. I wanted to know how they did it. I was insanely curious.As Coolio told me, ""You got me to reveal some deep stuff I didn't want to reveal. Kudos."" Tony Robbins had to literally shake himself at one point and say, ""Wait, how did we end up talking about this?"" I can't help it. I want to know.Here are the most important things I learned. I can't specify which person I learned what from. It hurts my head when I think about it because many of the 80 said the exact same thing about how they ended up where they were.Here is some of what they said:A) A life is measured in decades.Too many people want happiness, love, money, connections, everything yesterday. Me too. I call it ""the disease."" I feel often I can paint over a certain emptiness inside if only...if only...I have X.But a good life is like the flame of a bonfire. It builds slowly, and because it's slow and warm it caresses the heart instead of destroys it.B) A life is measured by what you did TODAY, even this moment.This is the opposite of ""A"" but the same. You get success in decades by having success now.That doesn't mean money now. It means, ""Are you doing your best today?""Everyone worked at physical health, improving their friendships and connections with others, being creative, being grateful. Every day.For those who didn't, they quickly got sick, depressed, anxious, fearful. They had to change their lives. When they made that change, universally they all said to me, ""that's when it all started.""C) Focus is not important, but Push is (reinvention).Very few people have just one career. And for every career, it's never straight up.When you have focus, it's like saying, ""I'm just going to learn about only one thing forever."" But ""the push"" is the ability to get up every day, open up the shades, and push through all the things that make you want to go back to sleep.Even if it means changing careers 10 times. Or changing your life completely. Just pushing forward to create a little more life inside yourself.Compound life is much more powerful than compound interest.D) Give without thinking of what you will receive.I don't think I spoke to a single person who believed in setting personal goals. But 100% of the people I spoke to wanted to solve a problem for the many.It doesn't matter how you give each day. It doesn't even matter how much. But everyone wanted to give and eventually they were given back.E) Solving hard problems is more important than overcoming failure.The outside world is a mirror of what you have on the inside. If Thomas Edison viewed his 999 attempts at creating a lightbulb a failure then he would've given up. His inside was curious. His inside viewed his ""attempts"" as experiments. Then he did #1000. Now we can see in the dark.Dan Ariely was burned all over his body and used that experience to research the psychology of pain and ultimately the psychology of behavior and how we can make better decisions.Tony Robbins lost everything when his marriage ended, but he came back by coaching thousands of people.It's how you view the life inside you that creates the life outside of you. Every day.F) Art and success and love is about connecting all the dots.Here are some dots: The very personal sadness sitting inside of you. The things you learn. The things you read about. The things you love. Connect the dots. Give it to someone.Now you just gave birth to a legacy that will continue beyond you.G) It's not business, it's personal.Nobody succeeded with a great idea.Everyone succeeded because they built networks within networks of connections, friends, colleagues all striving towards their own personal goals, all trusting each other, and working together to help each other succeed.This is what happens only over time. This is why giving creates a bigger world because you can never predict what will happen years later.Biz Markie described to me how he helped a 7-year-old kid named Jay-Z with his lyrics.Peter Thiel's ex employees created tens of billions of dollars worth of companies.Marcus Lemonis saves businesses every week on his show ""The Profit."" It doesn't come by fixing their accounting. It comes from fixing the relationships with the partners and the customers and the investors.The best way to create a great business over time: Every day send one thank you letter to someone from your past. People (me) often say you can't look back at the past. But this is the one way you can. You create the future by thanking the past.H) You can't predict the outcome, you can only do your best.Hugh Howey thought he would write novels that only his family would read. So he wrote ten of them. Then he wrote ""Wool,"" which he self-published and has sold millions of copies and Ridley Scott is making the movie.Clayton Anderson applied to be an astronaut for 15 years in a row and was rejected each time until the 16th.Coolio wrote lyrics down every day for 17 years before having a hit. Noah Kagan was fired from Facebook and Mint without making a dime before starting his own business. Wayne Dyer quit his secure job as a tenured professor, put a bunch of his books in car and drove across the country selling them in every bookstore. Now he's sold over 100,000,000 books.Sometimes when I have conversations with these people they want to jump right to the successful parts but I stop them. I want to know the low points. The points where they had to start doing their best. What got them to that point.I) The same philosophy of life should work for an emperor and a slave.Ryan Holiday told me that both Marcus Aurelius, an emperor, and Epictetus, a slave, both subscribed to the idea of stoicism. You can't predict pleasure or pain. You can only strive for knowledge and giving and fairness and health each day.Many people write me it's easy for so-and-so to say that now that he's rich. Every single person I spoke to started off in a gutter or worse. (Well, most of them.)Luck is certainly a component, but in chess there's a saying (and this applies to anything) ""it's funny how always the best players seem to be lucky.""J) The only correct path is the path correct for you.Scott Adams tried about 20 different careers before he settled on drawing Dilbert. Now, he's in 2000 papers, has written Dilbert books, Dilbert shows, Dilbert everything. Everyone was shocked when Judy Joo gave up a Wall St. career to go back to cooking school. Now she's on the Food Channel as an ""iron chef.""Don't let other people choose your careers. Don't get locked in other people's prisons they've set up just for you. Personal freedom starts from the inside but ultimately turns you into a giant, freeing you from the chains the little people spent years tying around you.K) Many moments of small, positive, personal interactions build an extraordinary career.Often people think that you have to fight your way to the top. But for everyone I spoke to it was small kindnesses over a long period of time that built the ladder to success. I think I'm starting to sound like a cliche on this. But it's only a cliche because it's true.L) Taking care of yourself comes first.Kamal Ravikant picked himself off a suicidal bottom by constantly repeating ""I love you"" to himself. Charlie Hoehn cured his anxiety by using every moment he could to play.I've written before: The average kid laughs 300 times a day. The average adult...5.Something knifed our ability to smile. Do everything you can to laugh, to create laughter for others, and then what can possibly be bad about today? I think that's why I try to interview so many comedians are comedy writers. They make me laugh. It's totally selfish.M) The final answer: People do end up loving what they succeed at, or they succeed at what they love.Mark Cuban said, ""My passion was to get rich!"" But I don't really believe him. He loved computers so he created a software company. Then he wanted to watch Ohio basketball in Pittsburgh so he created Broadcast.com. I worked with Broadcast.com a little bit back in 1997. They were crusaders about bringing video to the Internet.Sure, he wanted to use that to get rich. Because he knew better than anyone then how to let a good idea lead him to success.But deep down he was a little kid who wanted to watch his favorite basketball. And now what does he do? He owns a basketball team.N) Anybody, at any ageThe ages of the people I spoke to ranged from 20 to 75. Each is still participating every day in the worldwide conversation. I asked Dick Yuengling from Yuengling beer why he even bothered to talk to me. He's 75 and runs the biggest American-owned brewery worth about $2 billion. He laughed and said, ""Well, you asked me.""I just realized this list can go on for another 100 items.The specifics of success. How to overcome hardships. How any one person can move society forward.Down to even what are the most productive hours of the day, what's the one word most important for success, and what we can look forward to over the next century and maybe 100 other things.Then I learned many things about myself.Most of the people I asked to come on my podcast said, ""NO!"" I told Claudia the other day I haven't been rejected this much since freshman year of high school. I had to re-learn how to deal with so much rejection.I've always been a big reader but never as much as this year. I read everything by all the guests.Some weeks I felt like I was spending 10 hours a day preparing for podcasts. I learned to interview, to listen, to prepare, to pursue, to entertain, to educate.Podcasting seems like it's becoming an industry, or a business idea, or something worth looking at by entrepreneurs or investors. I have no clue about that.For me, podcasting this year was just about calling anyone I wanted to call and talking to them. I felt like a little boy interviewing his heroes.I highly recommend finding ways to call people for almost no reason. I learned a huge amount.But it was hard.It's one of those things where I can say, ""I don't know if I can ever do that again."" But I also know I'm probably going to say the same thing next year.",2015-01-05T15:27:07.000Z
FAQ on How To Become An Idea Machine,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/faq-how-become-idea-machine-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,8042,238,52,2015-01-02 00:00:00,9.0,"I was out of ideas when I googled ""how to kill myself"".I was sure that three things were going to happen: I'd go broke (and then my 3 year old would starve to death), nobody would kiss me ever again, and I would die because of course self worth = net worth (duh!).I started coming up with 10 ideas a day and I've written about this several times before: it saved my life, my career, my friendships, made me better friendships, partners, opportunities, a wife, better relationships with my kids, and oooga-booga (lots of kisses).In 2011, I wrote a post ""how to be the luckiest person alive"" where I described a daily practice I started to follow to get off the floor of suicide. Physical Emotional Mental and Spiritual health were the four pillars of this practice.Under ""Mental"" was the approach that if you don't exercise your ""idea muscle"" every day it would atrophy and you would lose the ability to be creative.So I encouraged people to write 10 ideas every day. I write 10 ideas every day no matter what. Yesterday, for instance, I wrote 10 ideas how Airbnb can be improved. Today I haven't written my list yet.Over the past 4 years I've gotten a lot of questions about this approach. Many of the questions have been the same over and over again.I've also gotten a lot of testimonials (unasked for) from people who told me they tried this approach and all the amazing things that happened to them afterwards.For me, I can safely say, my life completely changes almost 100% every six months in every way because I simply write down 10 ideas a day.Here I'm going to try and answer the questions that I often get asked. If you don't like my answers then feel free to ignore them.If you have more questions, ask them in the comments and I will answer.Different approaches work for different people. This approach works for me and I now see has worked for many others.A) Is ""The Idea Muscle"", or the Mental side of your daily practice, the most important part of the four?No. They are all equally important. If you get sick, then you can't be as creative.If you are staying up to midnight arguing with the loved ones in your life then you can't be creative (I learned this particularly well during my divorce).If you are anxious all day instead of grateful (the spiritual side of the practice) then you can't be creative.Worry never solves the future and always takes away energy from the present.Of course, you can try. But it's hard. If a chair has four legs then it's sturdy. If you remove one leg, then you can still sit in it but it will fall over at the slightest wind. And we all have the winds of change blowing in our lives.If you remove two of the legs then you will fall over. And if you try to sit in a one-legged chair then you probably need serious help in general.B) Do you have a theme each day for your ideas?Yes. As a simple example it might be ""10 businesses I can start?"" Or ""10 books I can write"" or ""10 chapters I can write for a book on quality parenting"" (which would obviously be a fiction book).Claudia is coming out with a book at the end of January with 180 possible themes.A theme is like a target, and knowing that you can come up with 10 decent ideas gets you closer and closer to hitting the bullseye on the target.C) What if I can't come up with 10 ideas?Here's the key: the first three ideas are always easy. The next two are a little harder, and for me, I find that ideas 5-10 make my brain literally sweat. It almost hurts.Ideas, art, business, life is all about connecting the dots of one area of your life with the dots in other areas of your life.Doing this directly translates into biologically building up the neural pathways between collections of neurons in your brain.This is what changes you from becoming a person with the occasional idea, to a creative person, to an idea machine. You become the one-eyed king in the land of the blind.D) My idea muscle has atrophied. How long will it take to become an idea machine?If you come up with 10 ideas a day for 180 days I'm pretty convinced based on what I've seen from 100s or 1000s of others then you will be a full force idea machine.E) What is an idea machine?It means that you can have confidence that no matter what situation you are in, you can start spewing ideas to help yourself and others in that situation. Ideas are about giving. And the more you give to the world, the more value you get back.Almost everything you look at will become sources of inspiration. Almost every problem you hear about you'll be able to come up with solutions.Will they be good solutions? No, not necessarily. Which brings me too.F) Do all 10 ideas have to be good ideas?That would be impossible. If you are writing 10 ideas a day, that's 3,650 ideas a year.Nobody can come up with 3,650 good ideas a year. Someone who is a creative genius coming up with non-stop ideas might come up with a handful (less than 10) really good ideas and maybe slightly more (less than 100), decent ideas and the rest are probably bad ideas.Part of the idea of this exercise is give yourself permission to come up with bad ideas. To love yourself by recognizing that nobody is perfect.There's a story the advertising legend George Lois wrote where he says that he told everyone to come up with a great idea for a client. He came back in an hour and nobody had any ideas at all.So he said, ""ok, come up with 20 ideas."" He came back in an hour and everyone had 20 ideas. Some good, some bad, some decent. That's because they released the idea of perfectionism.If you are a perfectionist, you will never come up with good ideas. You have to love yourself enough to come up with bad ideas and still be happy and confident.If you wait for inspiration, you will never come up with good ideas.Inspiration is not like lightning. It doesn't strike. It's always there, like a deep well. Only by digging every day, do we get to tap into that well.G) I have so many ideas, I don't know which ones to work on? How do you pick?I never do. I always throw out my idea list for the day. The whole purpose of the exercise is to (metaphorically) expand the brain. Nothing else.Now, if an idea truly sets your heart on fire, then you won't forget it. The next day you'll come up with ten ideas to expand on that first idea. Or ten next steps to get that idea going.When you are an idea machine, trust that this will happen. Again: the ideas that are good will literally set your heart and mind on fire and you won't be able to wait to come up with the next batch of ideas for them.Don't think too much about which ideas are good and which ideas are bad. 99.99% of ideas are bad.Once, when I came up with the idea for a good business (one among ten business ideas I wrote the day before), then the next day I came up with ten pages that would be on the website for that business.And the next day I came up with ten ideas for partners that business might have. And the next day I came up with 10 ways I can execute on this business.And that morning I started executing on that business. Two weeks later I had a big partner for that business. Eight months later I sold the business. Every week in between I had more and more features for that business.I was excited about it. I loved it. I thought every day about it. If you have to look back at prior lists to remember the ideas, then they didn't excite you enough. Don't do it.H) What is Idea sex?All of life is about connecting the dots.This is not a poetic metaphor. Since the Big Bang that created the universe, every piece of matter is the result of atoms combining and creating something new.Life on Earth is about organic molecules combining and creating something new.Societies are formed when people connect to form babies, when groups of people connect to form tribes, when tribes connect to form cities, or countries, and so on.Any achievement in science is the connection of all the achievements before it. As evidence, look at any patent and see all the prior patents it refers to.Any achievement in art is the accumulated knowledge and experience of all the artists and musicians and even scientists and philosophers, as well as personal experiences of the artist, that came before it.I once did an experiment with a group of people. Write down 10 titles of books you would like to write. Now turn to your partner. Make a list of ten books combining the titles.I asked for some examples. I loved all the results. For instance, a ""How to Make Toast in Space"" or ""A History of Music as Told by the Instruments of the greatest performers"". And so on.If you turn on any late night comedy show, the opening monologue is almost all idea sex. News topics of the day combined with ""set up / punch line"".The fastest way to generate themes and ideas is to take two different areas and combine them.The fastest way to master any area of life, is to become good at two or more areas, intersect them in a unique way, and now you are the best in the world at the intersection.If you look at every great achievement in history, idea sex was the impregnation of that achievement.I) People say ideas are a dime a dozen and that execution is everything. Is this true?No. Ideas are a dime for 3. A dozen ideas are hard. Try it.And execution, of course, is the key to making something happen in the real world. But the purpose of this exercise is to just stay healthy in a creative way.Ultimately, execution ideas are a subset of ideas.Here's one experiment to try: make two columns. The first column might be ""10 new business ideas"". The second column might be ""10 first execution steps"".So if my business idea is ""make an Isreali-Cuban fusion restaurant"" (bad idea). And my first execution step might be: ""Cook an Israeli-Cuban meal and invite 10 friends over and charge them $30 and see if they like it.""Always start with easy execution steps. MVEs. Minimum viable execution steps.J) Are the ideas usually about starting new businesses?No, usually not. It's really hard to come up with 3,650 business ideas a year.Money is just a side effect of being an idea machine.I try to make it about anything. ""50 alternatives to college"" was created this way.Or ""10 Ways I'd improve self-publshing"" which I sent to Amazon and they invited me to come out there and see what they were working on.Or ""10 ideas for a novel"" or ""10 pairs of people I should introduce to each other"". And on and on. ""10 things I can cook for Claudia tonight"" (that one was REALLY hard for me. I'm not a good cook).K) I keep coming up with good ideas but then I go out drinking with my friends on Friday night and tell them my ideas and they all laugh at me. What should I do?Stay home on Friday night.L) I've been doing this for three months and I haven't seen any difference in my life?Do it for three more months and you will. Every day.In order to build a house, the foundation has to be strong.The foundation gets strong when you focus on all areas of the daily practice. Physical health, emotional health (be around people you love), and spiritual health.Anger, envy, self-pity, regret, anxiety are all fires that burn the foundation. Gratitude and surrender washes away those fires.Then you can build your house. Then you can live in it.M) I have no time to do this. What should I do?Simplify your life. The simpler every part of your life is, the more power you have to make significant changes in the world.The first thing is: do you really have no time? I've now spoken to or read about two different people who have written best-selling novels on their train commutes to work.Another key is to avoid meaningless gossip at work. Or to stop watching bad TV at night. Or to wake up a half hour earlier than usual. Or to spend 15 less minutes surfing on Facebook.Heck, make a list of the 10 ways you waste time every day.I have found in my own life that these fragments of time often add up to hours a day.The other thing is to do what I call the simple daily practice. Do tiny things. Maybe don't snack today (Physical), maybe write a thank you email to someone you love (emotional), come up with 10 ideas (mental), spend 10 minutes feeling grateful (spiritual).There's always time. Nobody starts off at the top. Which leads to...N) I have an Idea. How do I get money for it?You don't. You have to implement it. You have to have other people who like it. You have to get money from customers who like it. You have to build up so that it can support yourself.For my first business, I started it, got customers, got employees, had an office, and then, 18 months into it, I quit my fulltime job, and went to my startup fulltime.That's how business works in the real world.We live in an entitled world now where people think ideas are enough now to get funding and make billions.Go old school. Deliver proven value to others, charge money for it, get testimonials about how good your product is, and then you've widened the horizon of your decisions. That's the path to success.O) How do I know if an idea is good?Well, chances are it's pretty bad. The key again is to expand the abilities of your brain so you are a non-stop idea machine. This way you are more likely to come up with a good idea.A great story is the story of the company, Odeo.They created software for podcasting. They got professional venture capitalists investing. The CEO previously sold a company to Google so he knew what he was doing. He had the top software programmers working for him.But nobody wanted his software. On the side, Odeo's programmers had a side project going, but it only had 10,000 users. Smaller audience than most good blogs. And yet...The CEO told all of his investors, ""we give up. We're going to work on this side project. If you want to stay in, good. If you want out, I will buy all of your shares so you wont' lost any money.""The result: 100% of the top, most professional investors in the business took their money back. The CEO renamed the company and focused on the tiny software project.A few years later Twitter became public and is worth tens of billions of dollars.Nobody can predict the outcome of an idea. And usually people are wrong. That's why quantity is important.The key is to every day stay physically emotionally mentally and spiritually healthy.Then you can trust that you have built the inner foundation for outward success.The outer world that you face every morning is always a reflection of the inner world that only you can create.P) What if I have more than 10 ideas a day? Should I save some of them for the next day?No, write them all down. THIS POST is my idea list of the day. I just wrote down 16 items Yesterday was 10. The day before was about 12.What's going to happen if you do this for six months?You're going to be a mutant superhero.You're going to have fun creative ideas for every situation. You're going to be able to see which ideas set your brain on nuclear.You're going to meet the right people who can help you execute on ideas. You're going to turn into a fountain of giving.You're going to be the sort of person that understands that less effort leads to greater accomplishments.You're going to be immortal because you will begin to lead a life that is worth remembering forever.",2015-01-02T13:46:51.000Z
The Most Important Decision You Can Make For...,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/most-important-decision-you-can-make-success-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,33427,461,151,2014-12-29 00:00:00,10.0,"I forgot to tell you something. I have a business partner named Dan.A friend of mine asked another friend of mine a few months ago: ""how come James doesn't have any business partners over the long run"".Mostly because I just write about bad stuff. Good stuff is boring. But it's important also.How come? Because when you hit bottom, as we all do, sometimes you need one good person to remind you that everything is going to be ok.Dan has been my partner since 1999. So about 15 years.When 9/11 happened, we were running a hedge fund. We had both eaten breakfast right at the World Trade Center. We were walking up the street a block or so away and we saw a plane cruising right at us. Dan said, ""Is the President coming to town?""And then the plane whizzed over, everyone had a reflex to duck. Then we heard a BOOM!I don't like to tell this story because obviously many people had it much worse. But I was all set to kill myself I was so depressed. Dan came over and told me, we have to keep moving forward.So we did. And it didn't work out. We failed miserably. That's another story.Then we started a fund of funds. It worked out ok, but not great. Then we did other deals that worked out ok. Then we started 9 different businesses that failed. Then we started Stockpickr that succeeded. Then we made lots more deals, investments, opportunities, etc.One time in 2007-2008 I disappeared. I was supposed to be writing articles for thestreet.com. But I was depressed and couldn't get out of bed. Couldn't move.Instead, Dan wrote them for me. He knew my style and I'd take a look at the finished product and put my name at the bottom. For an entire year I was a pretty bad guy.Dan covered for me until I got balanced on the dangerous high wire between youth and maturity.But mostly that year I was largely unconscious. In every way. 23 hours a day I was doing bad things. Sometimes I'd go on CNBC and I'd call Dan and ask him what to say. He'd feed me the lines. I'd say them. People would laugh.Dan works in a basement in his mom's house in the midwest. His grandma is his next-door neighbor. His brothers are on the other side of his house. His parents live in back of his house. He's a family guy. He refused to go on my podcast. He doesn't want anyone to know who he is. He probably hates that I'm writing this. Tough!In 2003, Turkey had a terrorist attack at 3 in the morning. I called Dan and woke him up. I was too nervous to trade. He sold everything we owned. Then at 4am I changed my mind and called him and woke him up again. He bought back everything.One time we were going to sell a company in 2006. The deal was really bad. I wanted to take it anyway. I was desperate for money. Dan said, ""if you take this deal I guarantee you will be jumping off the Empire State Building within a year.""We didn't take the deal. Instead we started another business which worked out very well.When Dan was getting married in 2004, about five minutes before he was to say ""I do"" to his beautiful wife he found me in the audience and came over and asked me, ""Did we get the wire?""We had in fact, the day before, got a huge wire which started our fund of funds. He said, ""YES!"" and then went up and got married.In 2008 we were both in danger of losing everything. We were scared. We started at least four businesses and none of them worked. Most of them were my ideas but Dan never blamed me for costing us a ton of money. Every day we kept trying and eventually things worked.15 years is a long time to be a partner with someone. Particularly when things go really really bad in the middle. Up and down. Up and down. Up and down. Fugh and Ugh.I fully expect we'll be partners for the next 15. Then maybe I'll stop returning calls completely and just walk into the ocean. I don't know. It's a long time away.One thing we've always learned: if we have zero money in June, we might be rich by October.Nothing was predictable. It is senseless to have a goal.We simply had a direction: every day we'd look for opportunities rather than regret our circumstances. This is the key for success.Many people tried to take advantage of us and give us bad deals but sooner or later we'd cut them off.I hope now, after dealing with at least 100 people who try to suck the life out of you, who will stab you in the back but smile to your face, that I know how to handle that better. But it's hard. Partners are good to help with that.It's hard to fly solo. Sooner or later someone falls asleep at the wheel and the other person has to drive for awhile. That's how you drive across country without stopping.The most important choices I've ever made in my life. Who will my wife be? Who will my friends be? Who will my partners be?Whenever I let other people make those choices for me, it didn't work out. There had to be a warmth in me that made those choices. Else, they would flame out and I'd explode.This is your new family when you are an adult.If you choose right, then later choices become simple. The less effort you have to give something, the more powerful you become.Dan is good at what he's good at. I'm good at what I'm good at. They are two different things and they don't overlap so we've never really had an opportunity to argue in all of the past 15 years. I don't think even once.The only other thing that's important when finding a partner is character. It doesn't matter if your partner is the smartest person in the world. Intelligence gets you only so far. Character changes the world.Well, I just wrote about a good thing. Maybe tomorrow I'll start writing about bad things again. About being homeless or helpless or scared or angry.Or maybe I'll just relax. Let the dead bury the dead.",2014-12-29T15:06:51.000Z

Everyone in Astoria is Greek. And they pretty much stick to themselves.Nobody would talk to me. I would walk for miles in Astoria hoping that just one person would talk to me.Weekends were the worst. I missed my friends at work. The Museum of the Moving Image was down the street so I would go there to watch various indie movies. Two things: the Hal Hartley retrospective was great.

What Are The Things You Are Most Afraid To Do?,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-things-you-most-afraid-do-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,39971,200,117,2014-12-22 00:00:00,11.0,"Ugh, turn the computer off, Claudia! Ugh, Gag, I have to throw up now. I'm going to throw up. She just accidentally hit play on one of my podcasts. I'm talking. I hear my own voice.You would think we get over that eventually. Like when you're a grown human being. I HATE IT.""Do I sound like that?"" I asked her and I thought I was honestly having a gag reflex. She's like, ""What?"" And I'm, ""DO I SOUND LIKE THAT!? HOLY SHIT!""She couldn't figure out how to turn it down.""TURN IT OFF!""She turned it off and reached out to me but I was reverting to the fetal position and was about to climb back into my mother's vagina.Ok, I'm ok now. Ok. ok.""You sound lovely, honey,"" she said but that's it. I hate podcasting. I'm going to quit. Done. I'm glad she's nice to me though. Now I feel better. ""Ok, I'll podcast again. But not until tomorrow."" Moods can be like that. Right?The only way to get better is to hear my own podcasts. I know that. But I just can't do it. There's a lot of things I would get better at if I were not secretly afraid of them. That's one of them.People say they want to do all sorts of things but in reality they are just afraid of them. I shouldn't say ""people"". What do I know? I mean ""me"". Or ""I"". Whatever.But you can try this with me. What are the things you are truly afraid of but you'd like to do.Some people are afraid to put hard work into something they love and then ask money for that. I know many yoga teachers and artists are ashamed to ask for money for something they view as beyond money.I am not saying they are right or wrong, it's just hard. This Friday I'm chatting with Amanda Palmer about her book, ""The Art of Asking"".She had to get over her fear of asking for money for her work. As she puts it, she was afraid that if she asked then the ""Fraud Police"" would be after her.I can relate to that. I can relate to it so much Claudia and I were supposed to write a book called ""The Power of ASK"" but after Amanda wrote her book I decided to stop ours and write something else.For me, right now I'm afraid of:A) Standup comedy.I really want to go to an open mic and just do it. I have material written. I'm all set. I must be afraid of it. I can't imagine any other reason I'm not doing it.I sort of do standup comedy in my talks but that's easier. People ask me to talk about something else so they aren't there for just me joking around. I have fun with that and I get about 1-2 laughs a minute. But going in front of a crowd that doesn't know me just to make them laugh somehow scares me.Standup comedy seems to me like the holy grail.Dick Costolo, CEO of Twitter, tells a story about how a year or so ago he ran into Steve Carrell at a reunion of people who worked together on improv at Second City in Chicago. Dick was already CEO of Twitter and Steve Carrell had just finished his stupendous run at ""The Office"".Steve said to Dick, ""Well, I'm really sorry it didn't work out for you.""B) Novel.I wrote 4 or 5 about 20 years ago and they were awful. You have to do ""awful"" in order to put in your 20,000 hours. Since then I've written quite a bit that I like but no fiction.Maybe the closest is the book, ""The Choose Yourself Stories"" which tells stories but is not quite fiction.I've started and stopped three or four times this year. There must be something I'm afraid of there. Like maybe it won't be good. I don't know. If I had the answers I probably wouldn't be afraid of it.C) More speaking events.I like how Marianne Williamson does a talk every Monday in LA. I think she does it for free. I admire that consistency.D) Dinner.",2014-12-22T13:54:28.000Z
"Are You A Giver, Taker, Or Matcher?",https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/you-giver-taker-matcher-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,6940,218,62,2014-12-19 00:00:00,9.0,"I'll tell you why. It's because I was prejudiced. I didn't want to interview Adam Grant, author of ""Give and Take"" for a simple reason: he was the youngest tenured professor at Wharton.So he rose up through the ranks, smart guy, wrote a book, got tenure, big success.The standard ladder. The anti-choose yourself ladder. The higher education ladder.But then I read the book. I friended him on Facebook. I asked if I could talk to him. And then we did the interview.How come? Because I wanted therapy.The book is a simple model for dividing people into three categories. Givers, Matchers, and Takers.I should add that many people were telling me I was crazy to not interview Adam. And now I agree with them.But while I was reading the book I was thinking selfishly the whole time, ""hmm, I hope I'm a giver and not a taker.""In part, because I like to think of myself as someone who is giving. That sounds nice. It even sounds romantic as opposed to thinking of yourself as someone who is always ""taking"".But also because givers tend to succeed more according to Adam. They also tend to fail more. So it depends. You have to be a giver who gives to ""champs"" and not ""chumps"".I definitely used to take a lot. I would take all I could. Not because I was evil (I hope) but because I was scared.If I didn't take, someone else would. I was scared I would go broke. Or wouldn't feed my family. Or wouldn't find the girl. Or someone would take credit for something I did. On and on. I was scared and hid in my closet against the monsters.I think ""taking"" ruined my life for at least ten or so years. I saw the world as a small place and not a big universe.When you take, it's like the world is divided into eight slices of pizza and either you eat one of the slices or someone else does.The reality is: when you Give, you create a bigger world.If I introduce two people today and they create something of value without me being in the middle, then the world just became a bigger place.If I help a colleague at work do their job better, then my workplace just got bigger. If I answer a question sent to me from somewhere in Pakistan and their lives get a little better, than the entire world just got microscopically bigger.The more you give, your universe compounds into something infinite. There's no end to the universe, but when you give you push out your boundaries more and more. More air to breathe, more room to maneuver, more opportunities to succeed.I know one guy who ""takes"" a lot but he does it by pretending to ""give"".He once wrote me that he was now finally ""calling in all the favors he had ever done"" and he asked me to do something.He kept writing me. I finally had to write back and say, ""I'm happy to help but what exactly did you do for me that you keep reminding me about."" He didn't reply.We all know takers who wear the clothes of a giver.I asked Adam about this. He said, ""if you are a giver and you are dealing with a taker, you have to act like a matcher - in other words, make sure up front you are getting something for your giving."" But in all other situations just give.He described the story of Adam Rifkin, an entrepreneur/VC in Silicon Valley who is a massive giver. He might do a favor for someone, forget about it, and then ten years later the favor is returned in some unexpected way, or maybe it is never returned. Who knows?When a good gardener plants his seeds, he has faith that some small percentage of the seeds will grow. That is the nature of a giver.Rifkin has a concept he calls ""the five minute favor"". It's a way of easily planting as many seeds as possible not only during the day, but during a year, during a career, during a lifetime.Perhaps the most important thing I've learned in the past few years is that success can be measured in two ways:",2014-12-19T14:03:21.000Z

It's hard enough to help ourselves, let alone help others.Most of the time, every day is a battle against the things that will take us down. I've fallen so much I've come up with a comprehensive catalog of the nine ways you can destroy your life.As long as you avoid these nine things, you will jump from rock to rock across the pond and make it to the other side.Don't do them:(1) SICKNESSSometimes it's not your fault if your sick. But, don't fool yourself - most of the time it's 100% your fault.When my stomach hurts it might mean I was too stressed the day before. Or it might mean too much popcorn at the movies. Or too much to drink last night.Too little sleep is linked to sickness. It turns out that too much lying is linked to more complaining about health.You can make many choices to prevent sickness or improve health. You already know what they are. You don't need to read them in a book.(2) INERTIAWhen I go to a networking dinner, many of the people talk about the books they have no time to write. The dinner might go until midnight. No wonder they have no time to write their books.About a year ago Morgan Spurlock was filming a series for Showtime about ""The Seven Deadly Sins"". They called me up and wanted to follow me around for a day for their segment on ""Greed"".I told them ""Ok"" but my day is pretty boring: I read, I write, I walk, I make some phone calls, I read some more, eat, sleep.They never called me back.I was talking to David Levien on my podcast a few weeks ago (hasn't aired yet). He told me how he commuted into work and he would look around and everyone would be reading the NY Post or sleeping. ""I didn't want this to be a dead end for me,"" he said. He got depressed about it.So he took out his computer and started writing every day on the commute.A chapter a day. In a year he had his novel done. ""City of the Sun"". It became a bestseller. While everyone else was sleeping all around him. His fourth novel in the series comes out in March.(3) DOUBTSI started a company, Stockpickr, in 2006. For some reason I did not do any competitive research. I just assumed my site was the only site.It turned out I had about five competitors, some significantly more advanced than mine. I started to cry. I didn't know what to do.But I knew I had more passion for the project and more knowledge than any of my competitors but I was very afraid they would ""defeat"" me.When you pour your soul into something, it turns a tea of boiling water into nuclear energy.I have never doubted since then that when I pour everything I have into a project that it will turn into a nuclear project. If I write down ten ideas on how to make my business better, then it will become better. Eight months later I sold that business. All of my competition went out of business.(4) LAZINESSI did a podcast the other day with Dave Berg, who produced The Tonight Show for 20 years. I was really grateful he agreed to come on my podcast.He told me one of his favorite guests was Dennis Rodman. But often it was hard to get Rodman into the actual studios. He told me one time Rodman was supposed to be on the show but the day before he was doing some event in Nashville.So Dave flew to Nashville that day but then he lost track of where Rodman was. It turns out Rodman went out to Las Vegas and forgot to take Dave with him. So Dave flew to Las Vegas and then LA. Rodman made it to the show.Dave Berg got amazing guests on Jay Leno's show for 20 years not by sending out a bunch of emails every day and saying, ""Well, I did the best I could.""He actually DID the best he could. (5) CARELESSNESSOne time my agent pitched a book to a publisher I really wanted to work with.She said no.I said to him, take her out to lunch and ask her why. He hung up. Then he called me back and said, ""if you ever tell me what to do again then that's the last conversation we have.""It turned out that's the last conversation we ever had.He had been my agent for about a decade. He had made a lot of money because of me and this was the first time he was talking back to me.So I called the publisher and explained why this was the perfect book for her. I went up to her offices. She told me why she said, ""no"". I rewrote the whole proposal. I submitted again. She said, ""yes"".You get careless when you don't check every angle. When you get carved into a routine that is destined to be a road to nowhere.My agent will disappear with his industry. Maybe he'll find something he loves doing. But he won't do it by being careless.(6) VACILLATINGI wasted two years of my life once. HBO offered me a job and I didn't feel ready to take it. I thought I had to write a novel. To ""be that guy"" who wrote a novel.Note: I was applying for a programmer position.So I waited two years, never published a novel, and then finally went for the job.There's no right or wrong decisions. There's just decisions. You either make them or you wait to make them. And while you are waiting, everything in your life goes on hold.(7) NO PROGRESSI started a dating site once. Or twice. Many times actually. I had this obsession with starting a dating site. I think it was a perverse sexual fantasy that I wanted to help two people meet each other and eventually have sex with each other.In any case, I never made any progress on any of these sites. I always had this dream that I'd launch a website and the traffic would be so big that the servers would shut down.That did happen to me once. With a finance site. And with my blog. But I never had so much traffic that a dating site would work. When there's no forward motion I shut it all down pretty quickly.Why not? If you are writing down ten ideas a day there are many more things to explore.Don't try to dig a well where there's no water underneath.(8) DELUSIONSOne time I went out on a date with someone I had just met. It was really the worst type of date one could imagine.For one thing, I didn't know that she was really into crack.For another thing, I didn't know that she received messages from dead people through TV screens.I left that date pretty quickly when she was screaming at the TV in her hotel room.That's an extreme case. Every day I get business plans from people who think their business is the one business that will change the world forever. I got a plan the other day that was a social network for dead people. That's an example.Most people fall for a cognitive bias called ""Sunk cost bias"" where because they've already invested a lot of energy into something, then it must be the greatest business possible.Always take a step back and make sure you aren't deluded. Are you solving an urgent problem for someone in a scalable fashion and is it showing forward progress.Or, in a relationship, how many people do you know who are going out with men or women who are unavailable? Fact: 95% of relationships that start off with one person betraying another don't work out.Don't be deluded. (9) FALLING BACKWARDSI was talking on my podcast with Brian Koppelman, who wrote Rounders and Oceans 13 and, my favorite, Solitary Man. He told me that he had been having trouble grappling with some issues while writing Solitary Man.This is where he could've fallen backwards and stopped writing one of my favorite movies ever.Instead, he found a safety net where he could play out his ideas and work through his issues. He started doing stand up comedy. Then he finished the movie.If a business is going bad: if you are losing clients or key employees, you can give up. That's ok. But have your safety net. Your plan B.Know that you can still do something productive and this will see you through to the other side, rather than caving in to feelings of failure and misery and ""Why me?""Writing ten ideas down every day, being healthy, being grateful and giving to others, will always give you the safety net where you can fall and then bounce higher than you've ever been before.As Tony Robbins said on my podcast with him, ""if you ask lousy questions, you get lousy answers"". ""Why me?"" Is a lousy question.When you feel yourself falling backwards, remember that you are the average of the five people you surround yourself with.But even more important, remember that you are the average of the five thoughts you have throughout the day. You can choose ""anger"" or ""gratitude"". You can choose ""regret"" or ""what did I learn?"" You can choose, ""I give up"" or you can try standup comedy for awhile.",2014-12-15T14:21:04.000Z
Do You Believe in Coincidences?,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-you-believe-coincidences-james-altucher?trk=mp-reader-card,6736,197,57,2014-12-12 00:00:00,9.0,"One day a veteran commits suicide.I know this because my dad started a computer software business in 1970. I'm going to connect the dots because it involves a combination of coincidence and friendship.But first, why do veterans commit suicide? I have a 15 year old daughter. In 2.5 years, I guess, she is eligible to be in an army.Then she's allowed to go into the army, get a gun, and go some place where she can shoot other 18 year old girls who have guns. I am never going to be for this.War has never brought about peace. Only peace can bring peace.Because I believe this I have lost some friends. Some friends are horrified that I'm against the US participation in WW II (despite the fact that many pacifists in the US during those times were rabbis).Other friends are horrified that I'm against the Civil War (they think it's the same as me saying I'm ""for slavery"" which is ridiculous).I won't argue against them. To be honest, I'm not smart enough. Every argument I bring up, they have a counterargument.The biggest way to prevent yourself from making your dreams come true is to argue about politics. Politics is the graveyard of dreams.When people argue with me about war I just ask them if they would take my daughter's place if she ever had to go. Nobody has yet said yes.My dad started a software company that went public in the 1980s. It traded under the symbol CNSO and then eventually disappeared when his sales went to zero and he went bankrupt and spent most of the rest of his life crying with massive depression.About a decade ago I became friends with a very inspirational guy over the age of 80. In some way, he became like a father figure to me.We'd have breakfast once a month and he would tell me his stories.He told me he started his career at the age of 45. He wanted to be a venture capitalist instead of going door to door as an insurance salesman. He had no money in the bank at the time.He called up another investor at the time (the early 70s) and asked if he was doing the right thing. The investor he called, Warren Buffett, told him that he was making a big mistake and the country was going into a recession.Buffett was right and my friend struggled for awhile. ""James,"" he said, ""I was basically broke and had no idea what I was doing.""And then he made a small investment in a company (I think it was the company that became Caremark) that turned into $60,000,000 a few years later. And then he kept making more and more good investments. And now he's in his 80s and has given about $500 million in charity.He told me once about a company he was going to invest in. I think it's worth noting he always flies coach. ""James,"" he said, ""when people are diagnosed with depression it takes them on average eight years to find the right drug to cure them.""Psychiatrists can't tell if you have depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar, etc etc. So they prescribe one drug after another and usually it takes months to figure out if that drug is working. Often, patients give up. For the ones who stay, it can take eight years to find the right drug for them.Many veterans come back with some form of PTSD or anxiety or depression. It's too much, what they've seen.My friend was getting involved with a company that has a database of brain scans of people who have been successfully treated with a mental illness.They then take a veteran's brain scan and match it to the database. They look at the closest match, see what drug worked, and prescribe that drug to the returning veteran. All of the studies show significant results in the treatment.What's the stock symbol, I asked my friend.When he told me, I thought it sounded familiar. Out of 8000 public companies it turned out to be the same stock symbol, CNSO, as my dad's old company. My dad who basically died of depression.So I invested a little in the company. Who knows if it will work out or not. I have no idea, to be honest. I admit it, ""coincidences"" are a part of my investment strategy.There's something beautiful about a coincidence. As if the universe itself was an artist and you are the beautiful stroke of a paintbrush across an infinitely massive canvas.When I first met Claudia, on our third date she was waiting for me in a bookstore. She decided to find one of my books while she was waiting for me.She picked up a book that six months earlier (that apparently nobody bought) I had signed as a joke when I went into that bookstore.I was standing next to my daughter when i signed the book six months earlier and my daughter even said when she looked at what I wrote, ""Daddy, what the heck are you doing?"" I had never been in that bookstore before.Six months before I met Claudia I had signed that book, ""I love you"" and then signed my name. I didn't sign any other books that way out of the 1000 or so books I had signed around the city.Claudia had randomly picked that bookstore to meet at. She went looking for my books, found one among four or five that had never sold, and then opened it up and the first thing she saw was, ""I love you"", in my handwriting. When you believe in coincidences it's amazing how quickly you find them. And how fun life gets.Yesterday, for instance, I was in a Whole Foods in Florida (I live in New York) and I ran into someone I hadn't seen in 15 years who lives in San Francisco. BAM! Inside of most of us is a little kid. And little kids often live in a world where magic is real. I feel that a chapter in my life will be over when I stop believing in that magic.I don't know what coincidence will happen to me today. But I know it will happen. And I will close my eyes and enjoy the ride where it takes me.",2014-12-12T14:12:18.000Z
We're Not Gonna Take It,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141208152342-5858595-we-re-not-gonna-take-it?trk=mp-reader-card,25414,281,85,2014-12-08 00:00:00,10.0,"Jay Jay French, lead guitarist founder of the band Twisted Sister, told me how after they sold 20 million albums in the 80s, he was so broke and bankrupt that he had to take a job as a stereo salesman at a store.""I was also thinking about being a checkout guy at the grocery store.""""I'd go install stereos and people's houses and I'd see our records on the shelves and I wouldn't even say anything to them about who I was. I didn't want to be a sob story"".""But, can I ask...did you ever sob during those times?""He laughed. ""Oh yeah.""He started the band in 1973 and then they first broke up when he walked in on the lead singer at the time aiming a gun at the drummer. ""I thought I was about to witness a murder,"" he said.Jay Jay hasn't had anything to drink since 1970. He met Dee Snider, who became the lead singer, who also never drank or did drugs.They kept it clean and that's a critical advantage they've had over the other bands. ""40 years later,"" Jay Jay told me, ""we're the only band where all 5 members have been together for over 30 years without a change.""The band still tours, filling an average of 60,000 people per appearance.""The version of the band you see now changed 11 times in the first few years.""They changed everything to find the right people. Who you are with, knowing that you can trust the people around you, is the most important decision you make every day. Whether it's a wife, your mentors, your colleagues, the people you do deals with.Who you choose is more important than what you do.They were filling out local bars but they couldn't get a record deal. Finally, they got a deal, they got airplay, they got on MTV, they sold 20,000,000 albums and the rest is history. Until...Until they went bankrupt. Until Jay Jay had to take a job selling stereos.""I had to learn to reinvent myself,"" he said, ""and you never see someone reinventing themselves when they are on the top of their game.""He sold stereos for three years before a band I never heard of signed him on to produce their album. That band went on to sell 6 million albums. ""I made more money than I ever did with Twisted Sister.""Then he reformed the band, he started licensing the song, ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" and they started touring. ""That one song is the most licensed song of the 80s. It's crazy all the people who are licensing that song. Almost every political movement has licensed that song. Some of them try to not even pay but we always get them.""""If you could change one thing,"" I asked him, ""what would you change.""I knew what he was going to say. He was going to say ""Nothing"". I even heard the ""N"" sound coming out of his mouth so I said, ""And don't say 'Nothing'. Pretend you are giving advice to a 25 year old exactly like you.""""Always do what you say you're going to do."" He described one transaction where a guy providing lighting for his tour gave him a deal on the lights but trusted him to make payments every week.""He told me, 'this is just a verbal agreement and you can break it but then you're the guy who broke his word to me' and the guy was the biggest lighting guy in the industry. I didn't break my word and I still don't and that's why the band is still together 40 years later.""I asked him about when he was doing nothing, when the band had gone bust, when he had lost everything. He could've ended up doing nothing for the rest of his life.""I followed one simple thing: I wrote down ten things I always wanted to do and then I started back from the beginning and built up. I always knew stereos and I always loved music so I started selling stereos.""Within three years he produced a record, and now two decades after that he's made millions from licensing 'We're Not Gonna Take It'.",2014-12-08T15:23:42.000Z
Just Show Up,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141205144607-5858595-just-show-up?trk=mp-reader-card,380233,5625,1732,2014-12-05 00:00:00,13.0,"I was fired. I asked for one more week to finish what I was working on but my boss said, ""No. Clear out of here in the next hour.""I don't know why I was fired. Other people weren't. But I think my boss didn't like me.So I got depressed. I was going to run out of money, all my friends were going back to graduate school (I had been thrown out the semester before), and at the end of that summer my girlfriend broke up with me.The entire reason I stayed in Pittsburgh that summer was because of my girlfriend. I had a job offer at IBM but I had turned it down (it was to work on the chess computer ""Deep Blue"").I also felt rejected. Like nobody was going to care if I died.I was trying to get a novel published but that was going nowhere. I got rejected by over 40 or 50 agents. And it wasn't one of those things where I got a note that said, ""Keep at it, kid. You got talent."" All I got were form letters.I stopped bathing. What for? I didn't leave my apartment. One time some friends rang my doorbell and when I answered they said, ""Oh!"" And then they left.My dad offered to drive up to where I was and just take me home. ""Maybe you need to rest for awhile"". Thinking about it makes me sad because now he's dead and perhaps I should've taken him up on his offer.When you're a parent you realize all the missed opportunities you had with your parent.My sister gave me advice, ""just do one thing a day"". So I would do that. I gave chess lessons. I would try to write one page a day. I would read. I would apply for a job.I really wanted to work at the local comic book store but they wouldn't hire me. ""This is not really a profitable business,"" the owner told me. He was nice about it.But on my podcast, 20 years later, almost all of my guests says that the key to success is ""Show up every day"" which is similar to the advice my sister gave me when I was at a low point.I think Adam Carolla said it to me while he was washing dishes during my podcast. Very efficient. ""Show up every day"".I hate when someone gives me work to do. But lately I've realized that showing up every day actually gives me less work to do.It doesn't mean ""Show up ALL DAY"". It just means, ""Show up"". It could take ten minutes. It could take an hour. But if you do it, then you did your showing up for today.How can you show up today? Connect two people.",2014-12-05T14:46:07.000Z
The Ten Layers of Absolute Freedom,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141201141348-5858595-the-ten-layers-of-absolute-freedom?trk=mp-reader-card,174003,2978,721,2014-12-01 00:00:00,12.0,"It feels really crazy good to make out with someone, doesn't it? Remember the first time you did that? Amazing!My first thought was: why didn't anyone ever tell me it was going to feel this good?Ok, I just had to get that off my chest. Now for some serious stuff: like quitting, going broke, stealing, lying, and maybe even killing someone.In 2012 I wrote a popular article called ""10 Reasons You Have to Quit Your Job in 2012"". It got over a million views.In 2013 I wrote a popular article called ""10 Reasons You Have to Quit Your Job in 2013"". It got about two million views on the various sites I posted it on.In 2014, I wrote an insanely popular article called ""10 Reasons You Have to Quit Your Job in 2014."" It's now in the top 10 articles of all time on LinkedIn.Did you quit your job? If so, you can skip the rest of this article. Go find someone to make out with. If you've never done that before I can tell you it feels really good.The world is divided into angry people and free people.Anger is a subset of fear. Maybe you are afraid to be lonely. Or afraid to be broke. Or afraid to die?In 1994, 2001, 2005, 2008, and 2010 I was so angry and scared I didn't know what to do.I thought I had to have a purpose, a goal. But this is BS.There is only ONE purpose: TO BE FREE.There are layers of freedom.FIRST LAYER: Free from your own past and future. Which means: free of all regrets and petty hatreds from the past and anxieties and worries about the future.This is very hard. I have to practice this every day. When you practice something, you get better.For instance, I'm angry at someone who wrote me an angry email a year or so ago. That is petty. And he or she has his own fears. His own insecurities.Freedom is a daily practice. If you get 1% better every day at freedom then you become not just free but an explorer. Explore as much as possible before your last breath.#2: The next layer of freedom is to be free of other people's opinions of you. You never ride above the clouds if everyone is holding you down into the rain.One time I ran into a co-worker who gave her opinion about something I was about to do at work: ""you CAN'T do that. Nobody does that."" She still works there and is still unhappy. 20 years later. Another time several years ago someone wrote an article being somewhat cruel to me and taking things out of context.At first I was really bothered. I actually cried and said, ""why did he do this?"" We had been friends and he twisted it. There's no answer. I had to give up trying to answer everyone else's fears.#3: The next layer: be free of the opinions of the masses.While everyone is wearing surgical masks and staying indoors because of Ebola and the fate of the dollar you can be outside enjoying the sun.Everyone jumps on the latest trend. That trend gets weighed down by all the people jumping up and down on it.Don't look towards the future for trends. Look towards the past. What worked before? Do it 10 times better.PayPal is a great example. People have been paying each other for centuries. But with cash or credit. Paypal was 10x better. How about paying someone via email?#4: The next layer: be free of the word ""CAN'T"".I need to explain that one. Let's say I'm interested in basketball. I'm not going to be a professional basketball player.Realistically, I can't be one.Primarily because I'm 46 years old. Otherwise I would definitely be one, no question about it.But I CAN write a novel about basketball. I can be an agent. I can work for a team. I can be a marriage counselor for pro basketball players. I can be a referee. I can design homes with basketball courts inside of them.Don't think of an interest as a goal. Then you will spend your life with ""CAN'T"" as your lover. Think of your interest as a theme.DO THIS TECHNIQUE:a. I draw on a big piece of paper the names of all the themes I am interested in. games, writing, art, business, stocks, entrepreneurship, psychology, health, rap music, podcasts, TV, comic books, comedy, etc.b. I make a bunch of dots of what I can do with all of these themes. One dot might be ""write a novel"". Another dot might be ""start a podcast"". Another might be ""start a food truck"".c. Then I draw lines between the dots to connect them in various ways. Label each line. A line between games and psychology. Well, I can write about the psychology of a good game player and how that relates to business.Suddenly I have 100 careers to choose from. And guess what? I'm allowed to choose more than one. Nobody can stop me. I CAN do that.#5: The next layer of freedom: find someone who likes what you are doing.A standard technique in Internet business is to give away great value for free.Because then you get people to know who you are and like what you stand for. Steve Scott puts up a ton of free slideshares on how to build good habits.But then he writes a new book every three weeks about building good habits. In just a few years he went from making $0 a month writing books to making $60,000 a month writing books and newsletters about habits.He's not an exception. I know 100 other people doing this at least.#6: Now that people like something you are doing, start thinking of something you can charge for. A premium version of what you are doing.If you've never done this before, it feels overwhelming at first. I have a friend, Molly Hahn, who emails out doodles she makes every morning.Every doodle has a Buddha character in it and a quote. How the hell is someone who does that going to make a living? She emails out free doodles of Buddhas.This past year she made a six figure income selling things in her online doodle store.I have a Buddha carpet, for instance. It's beautiful. I lie down on it throughout the day. She figured out what to give out for free and what to charge for. She's not an exception. She RULES.#7: Another layer of freedom: ONLY do your best work 2-5 hours after you wake up.We are only at peak productivity two to five hours after we wake up. Here's what I do: I read for the first two hours after I wake up and then I write.After that I might still work, but mostly just followups and phone calls. Then I make out with people.#8: You don't need a lot to live like a king.It feels great when all of your bills are paid. It feels even better when you know you are doing something that will pay your bills for a long time.If all you do is that then you are in great shape. If all you need is ""enough"" then you are the king of the world.#9: Freedom is a path you choose every day.When everyone else is afraid they are ""stuck"", it's great to know that you are on your path to freedom.It takes years or even decades to be in your full stride so don't punish yourself if you are not ""there"" yet, wherever ""there"" is.When I interviewed the rapper Coolio he told me it took him 17 years of writing every day before he had a single hit. But he was free to do it every day. Then he wrote one of the bestselling songs of all time. ""I'm going to make money off of that one song for the rest of my life,"" he told me.When I interviewed the standup comedian Jim Norton he told me it took him 6 years before he was making a living as a comedian. Now he's one of the most successful comedians in the world, 20 years later.Do your themes every day because you love doing them. Remember that persistence + love = abundance. But persistence is measured in years, not days, not months. Go back to #1 when you forget this.#10: Final freedom layer: Realize that everyone you meet today has been sent down from an alien mother ship to teach you a lesson. Learn those lessons.This sounds like I'm making it up but it's true. Nobody will admit this of course. But trust me, it's true.If all you do is this layer of freedom, then nothing can ever stop you from living the best possible life.I know billionaires who don't do that final step and they are miserable every day. They even get to make out with a lot of people and are still miserable. Angry. So they try to make more money and they get angrier. Then they die.If you do any of the above, have a little celebration. Put a candle on a cupcake. Love yourself.Take a break from asking ""why me?"". Instead say ""wow"".Go from ""Why?"" to ""Wow!""Good luck and good night.",2014-12-01T14:13:48.000Z
Art is Bullshit. And Then 10 More Critical Things...,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141128143409-5858595-art-is-bullshit-and-then-10-more-critical-things-i-will-teach-you-about-art?trk=mp-reader-card,10058,412,109,2014-11-28 00:00:00,9.0,"Barnett Newman's painting, ""Black Fire 1"" sold for $84 million even though your five year old could've done it.He was never able to teach art because he would often fail the basic drawing classes that schools would make teachers pass.When I started writing blog posts one of the first tweets I saw, from a good friend of mine, was ""this is like watching a train wreck in slow motion"".I would write about what I did when I was dead broke. I would write about peeing face down on the ground while cars swerved around me.I would write about throwing a coconut on the ground in the middle of NYC on the advice of a psychic so I could make all my money back. I was scared. I was scared shirtless.People who came out of the financial world weren't supposed to do that. It was embarrassing.People still write me with the worst garbage. I love how people take valuable time out of their day to tell me what a horrible person I am. Sometimes it bothers me I have to admit.Sometimes people know the right button to press. But it gives me an opportunity to focus on the emails I get that tell me how my stories have helped them. I'm very grateful for that. I hope it never stops.Why is Barnett Newman art? He has one painting that is all red but a light orange strip (he called it the ""zip"") going right through it. He divided the art world from the word of meaning, to the world of meaningless.Aging is like that. We start off with ambition. ""I'm going to DO something"". We end with meaning: ""I'm going to help others.""Some pain, a bandaid covering a deep wound, divided the two.I'm not an artist. I try to write as well as possible, like many people. And sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.So because I'm not an artist at all I'm going to write what I think it is. Because nobody can stop me. There are no rules.1) DEFIANCESaying something that divides the world into a ""B"" and an ""A"". Before you said it and After you said it.You make people think that the world was upside down from what they thought before.Everyone divides the world into what is possible what is not possible. Art is when you make people think more is possible than they could have possibly imagined.2) BEAUTYIt doesn't mean physical beauty. Our thoughts are like the tip of an iceberg.When Amanda Palmer was just starting out she would dress up like a bride and silently hand anyone a flower who gave her a dollar.When you look at a bride, frozen on the street, wearing white makeup, her eyes looking at you, it brings up thoughts. What is a bride? What is love? What is the connection right now between me and her.What is the loneliness we can never quite shake and here is a hand willing to reach out to us with a flower for just a dollar.To put your finger on someone's loneliness, even for a second, is art. It's a massage of the heart.3) CONNECTIONOn every website I see articles like ""10 Ways to Get a Job"" and the article usually gives very practical advice. I think the authors can improve these stories.The more blood in the article, the better the article is. The more you tell your story, the deeper the well people can drink from.Most people give advice freely. But they forget to tell their story.When you do that, you let people sip from your dirty hand but you don't let them drink from the well of your life.4) A NEW WAY TO LOOK AT THINGSMichael Jackson made a song about gang violence. Weird Al took the exact same song and made it about finishing your dinner.Al showed that meaning can be twisted and still enjoyed. Gang violence is important. But so is an ability to look at the same thing and have fun with it.Andy Warhol made a painting of a Campbell's Soup can. Can any child do it? Of course. Why was Warhol art? You might think it wasn't. Others might say he was the first to really underline the commercialization of art. A before and after way of looking at things.5) THE TRUTHColleen Ballinger saw all of her classmates put up videos on YouTube while singing or performing. They all thought they were going to become discovered on YouTube and then suddenly rich and famous. She thought they were untalented idiots.So she put on sloppy bright red lipstick. She clipped her hair back in the ugliest way possible. She began giving completely arrogant lessons on how to perform. She messed up all her words while pretending not to realize it.And she (performing as ""Miranda Sings"") gets about 8 million views per youtube video and is performing all over the country now.The truth is: silliness is art. Seriousness can lead to disappointment.Jerry Seinfeld had her on his show. At one point he was frustrated with her constant complaining. He said, ""I thought I was helping your career by having you on here.""She said, ""What!? I thought I was helping you!""That's art.6) COMBINATIONEveryone looks at Jackson Pollack paintings and says ""I can do that"". But can they? Maybe they can.Jackson Pollack took his whole body, took other materials and not just paint, took down the canvas and put it flat on the floor and used his body to fling paint and other objects all over the canvas.He created a new form of art combining painting, abstract expressionism, sculpture, dance, Jungian philosophy, and defined his own category of art.He was just as insecure as anyone else. He was afraid he was going to go out of fashion. He took on a mistress. He had problems with alcoholism. He died (and killed a passenger) while driving drunk one night.And yet the energy he brought to what he did, the combination of history and future and movement and sculpture and paint makes him one of the greatest artists of the past century.He combined with energy and passion. More than anyone else before him.7) FEARWhen you make art, you're striking out on a path that is totally new. Don't do it unless it's new.Why is this scary? People might hate you. People might resent you. People will make fun of you. People will call you trash. People will say ""why is this even here?"" People deny you opportunities and money.Vincent Van Gogh died broke. Kafka died broke. The list goes on. If you do what you love, you can't do it with the hope of obtaining something.You have to do it with a sense of surrender. You're doing it because your body and mind want to do it, not because your wallet wants to do it.Fear brings humility. Fear brings gratitude from you to the people who admire what you are doing.Why would you want to do something that makes you afraid? Because art again comes from that sense of connection that we have with the rest of the human herd. It's a way at a deep level we can communicate with others.That connection feeds us more than any dollars will.Right now in New Mexico there is a radar waiting for signals from outerspace. They may never get a signal. Or it may take 100s of years. We don't know.We all feel sometimes like we are from deep in empty outerspace. We just want to send out a signal that someone will listen to and respond to. If you aren't afraid, then you aren't doing it right.8) CRAZYI erased this entire section when editing. 9) LAUGHTERWhy not? If you can give an adult 5 more reasons to laugh today then you just made their life 100% better.10) MESS UPWhat do I know about art? Who am I to comment on it? Nobody. I am an absolute nobody. It's arrogant and foolish. BLAH!I am someone who thinks everyone has the latent ability to quit their job and become king of their worlds. That's what I believe. That's my evil plan.To get everyone to celebrate their abilities and quit their job and make millions. I believe that you can do that.What is art?When your chest and your heart and your mind are all on fire and you feel like a god just kissed you.",2014-11-28T14:34:09.000Z

Then in 2012 and 2013 and this year. I kept saying No.Robbie told me he has 250 coffee meetings a year.So in one way of thinking about it, I'm one in 250. And over a period of four years, I'm one in a thousand. So not so special.I don't usually meet new people for coffee. I like to sit in my room and read and write and deal with business stuff. A few months ago I was on a three week vacation to Thailand one block from the beach and it took me two weeks to get to the beach.Robbie wrote to me and said, ""I'll even come to where you are"". I live 80 miles north of NYC. I figured he was bluffing.So I said, ""ok, but I only have 15 minutes."" Who is going to drive 1.5 hours to have coffee with me for 15 minutes and then drive 1.5 hours back to the city.He said, ""ok"". And I said, ""ok, meet me at 12:15 and I gave him the address, ""but I might be late"" because I had a podcast that started at 11.When my podcast was over, he was there. I didn't want to have coffee. So I said, ""come back to my house and let's do a podcast. He came back with me and Claudia and I did an 'Ask Altucher' podcast with him, ""Why do you have 250 coffee meetings a year?""He described that he was in a bad job situation he had several years ago but he had no network at all.He was scared. He wanted to go on his own but he was afraid to go broke.He wanted to figure out how to make connections. So he joined a networking group and then started having coffee with everyone in the group and asking them, ""how can I help you? Who can I introduce to you?""This is a great question. About 50% of people consider themselves too shy to introduce themselves to other people. Maybe the real number is even higher. I consider myself a shy person. In a party I hide and just like to watch people.For Robbie, if someone said, ""I want to meet X."" he would then try to have coffee with X, he'd mention that the other person wants to meet X and why. If X was agreeable, he'd make the introduction.I call this ""permission networking"". If you just introduce two people without their permission then you just contributed to ruining their lives.You outsourced the question of ""Why should these two people meet"" to them instead of solving the problem yourself.Many people don't want to figure out why they should meet someone. They are already busy enough.Hence, everyone will hate you, the guy in the middle that gave them more work to do.Robbie described all the ways he benefited from these coffees.Sometimes he would and sometimes he wouldn't. Some people would pay him and some would ignore him. But bit by bit, having 250 coffees a year allowed him to build a successful marketing business.

10 Things I Learned While Interviewing Tony...,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141119122834-5858595-10-things-i-learned-while-interviewing-tony-robbins-about-his-new-book-money?trk=mp-reader-card,27155,350,90,2014-11-19 00:00:00,10.0,"[Here is the link to the podcast: http://bit.ly/1t8RJ80]When we got to Tony Robbins' house we were specifically prevented from photographing his sneakers. I took out the camera but his assistant shook her head. ""No"". Which made me feverish to take the picture even more but I didn't.Everyone takes their shoes off. And all the other shoes were like normal human shoes. Then there were his sneakers.My business partner called me after we did our a major deal in 2004. I was about to go broke when we did this deal but we did it and it saved my life. My partner said, ""you'll never guess what number I wrote down in 2001 after we both read ""Awaken the Giant Within"" ' and of course I guessed correctly. It was the number we made in 2004.In 2001 he was ashamed to tell me. ""Guess who I am reading."" And then we realized we were reading the same books. Both of Tony Robbins books. But they were written so long ago I kept going to the bookstore thinking Tony Robbins was going to have a new book out any day.Now Tony Robbins has a new book out today. For the first time in 25 years I think.Bill Clinton is the first blurb on the inside of his book (I ask him about that in his interview: ""Why does Bill Clinton even call you? What do you guys talk about?"")So I was really excited to fly down to his house in Florida and interview him a few weeks ago. It was like going down to visit a member of the X-Men.Claudia and I got to his house and his staff helped us set up our equipment and then we took a walk out to the ocean. It was beautiful. We felt lucky and relaxed.Then we went back inside. I told Claudia to start the recording before Tony even showed up. So we could pick up all idle chit chat. When Tony arrived we started talking and he said, ""this is good. We should record this"" and then he was laughed when Claudia said we were already recording.The book is called ""Money"" a topic I sometimes know a lot about and sometimes know nothing about. I ran hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, and have advised many money managers, often people managing billions of dollars.Tony took it one step further and interviewed the top money managers in the world, how they do what they do. He exposed many of the scams still on Wall Street. He gives simple advice that everyone can follow.We spoke for an hour. Here's what I learned from the book and from talking to him. I'm mostly going to leave out the financial stuff. All of that is in the book: the scams, the ways to avoid them, the interviews with the amazing people he spoke with.Here's what I personally learned.A) ASK LOUSY QUESTIONS, GET LOUSY ANSWERS.Many people say, ""Why did this have to happen to me?"" Or ""Why did I lose that job when I was good?""These are lousy questions. You will never get an answer that makes your life better. I get bitter, resentful, angry. And anger is a form of fear. I'm usually afraid I'm going to go broke. And if I go broke, I'm afraid I die.You have to ask good questions: ""What can I do to improve?"" or ""How can I find a better job?"" or ""How can I be grateful that I lost this job?""Because inside of every problem is the seeds of a ""difficult gratitude problem"" and it always improves your life to solve those problems.B) TO MASTER ANYTHING, TALK TO THE EXPERTS.Tony told us about a time when he was 24 years old and he wanted to train members of the military to shoot better.""I had never shot a gun in my life,"" he said and laughed in his raspy voice. He was scared he wouldn't do a good job.So how did he solve this problem? He spoke to five excellent sharpshooters, figured out what they all had in common, and then used that to increase the results of the students in the school by 50%.C) BRING THE TARGET CLOSER.Specifically, for every student he had them bring the target only a few feet away. Everyone shot bullseyes. Then he moved the target back a foot. Bullseyes. Then another foot. And so on.This is true for everything in life. I look at the example Mark Cuban told me. He didn't just start Broadcast.com and make a billion. First he started a bar. Then he started a computer business. Then a hedge fund.He brought the target very close and then moved it further and further away as he succeeded at each thing.I thought about teaching my 12 year old how to serve in tennis. First I had her serve from the net. ""All you have to do is hit the ball into this huge box."" Then when she got 10 in a row I had her move back a few feet until she hit the base line. Now she's got the most consistent server on her team (I'm bragging).D) LOOK AT GOALS DIFFERENTLY.Tony told us of one time he asked people what their goals were. One guy said, ""I want to make a billion dollars!"" At first this would seem like an admirable goal - set it high! There's that horrible saying, ""Aim for the moon, because even if you miss it you'll find yourself among the stars.""But Tony said, this guy didn't really understand his goal.He broke it down. ""Why do you want a billion?"" And the first answer was, ""I want my own plane"". Tony told him, ""Well a plane costs $100 million and you might only be flying 12 times a year. If you charter a yet for $30,000 an hour then it will take you forever to spend $100 million."" So suddenly the guy didn't need $1 billion anymore. He needed $900 million.""By the end of that session,"" Tony said, ""it turns out to achieve the exact lifestyle he thought he needed a billion for, he needed $10 million."" This is still a lot of money but this was Tony's way of bringing the target closer.When I read that in his book, I did the exercise with Claudia. Her numbers went down by 90% when we really went through it. What happens then? You feel relief. You don't have to be on the hamster wheel of money for your whole life. What you want is freedom, not money.E) EXPERTS KNOW THEY KNOW NOTHING.All the time I get spam financial newsletters saying, ""The Markets are going to zero!"" or ""This stock is going to go up 1000%!"" The reality is the experts know zero. With every investment expert that Tony interviewed they not only had a plan B. They had a plan C, D, and E.The best professionals in the business admit they know nothing.Nobody can predict the future. Anything can happen. When I got out of the ""future"" business I was much happier. I got into the possibility business.This made me a lot more successful. Leave the future business for the possibility business and the world will get infinitely larger.F) HIS ENERGY IS INFECTIOUS.Somebody told me he jumps up and down on a trampoline before speaking in front of 10,000 people. He wants his energy at peak.I thought about doing that before my most recent TED talk but there was no trampoline available. But it's true. When he came downstairs to talk to us he was very excited about the potential for his book to help people. It almost made me want to write about financial stuff again.After Claudia and I left his house (and, by the way, that's a BIG house) we had so many ideas about creative things we could do we almost had to pull over and calm down. So we went to Cheesecake Factory and ate until we exploded.G) THE TONY ROBBINS METHOD.In the interview I said, ""Ok, I figured it out. You use ""the Tony Robbins Method'"". Which I defined as, 1. at first you don't know anything 2. you find 5 people who are the experts in the world 3. you extensively interview them 4. you figure out the most simple things they have in common with each other 5. you do that simple thing over and over and over and over (repetition)And that's how you succeed.H) PEOPLE NEED CERTAINTY. PEOPLE NEED VARIETY.Everyone needs to know where their next meal is coming from. And maybe their next kiss. And maybe...a bunch of things. We crave some stability, which was the appeal of corporate jobs for the past 100 years (although that period is now slowly coming to an end) and was the appeal of all these mutual fund ads that say, ""we return 9% a year"".But most of that stability is a lie. You have to find stability inside yourself first.For me, it's stable to make money from multiple sources. To know that if I have ideas every day, then life will be more stable than if I don't.But we also need variety. A marriage will die if you stick to the same routine year after year (""the 7 year itch""). A job will get boring. We only have one life. It doesn't mean you quit your marriage or quit your job. But always look for new things to learn. Always look for new ways to surprise. Always look for new ways to break out of your comfort zone.It's this dance of certainty and uncertainty that made us human and we often lean too much in one way or the other. But if you did that on the dance floor you'd fall over.Tony describes this in the book in a financial sense. His goal is to expose the lies in the financial community and get you thinking about how to provide stability there so you can find variety in other parts of your life.I) SHOW PEOPLE YOU ARE GRATEFUL.When we are very young we build strong neural circuits across our brains so that electricity can pass quickly between certain neurons. This is why it's easier to learn when we are young then when we are older.After the age of 20, we lose the ability to ""insulate"" these neural circuits with myelin, the substance which cements these circuits for life. This is where our basic intelligence comes from. Building as many circuits as possible with myelin protecting them.I think the same thing happens with relationships. Business, personal, family relationships, etc. They start off young and that's when you can build almost a ""relationship myelin"" around them. You do that by being honest with people, by showing gratitude, by not overusing the connection, by treating it just right so it develops into something that can last a lifetime.If someone does something for you, show you are grateful.J) BE THE SERVANT OF MANY.Tony said in the interview exactly how much he saved in taxes by moving from California to Florida. It was a big number. He had a big house. He's spoken in front of three million people. He's feeding 50 million people. This is a process that took him 30 years or more.He said the way he did it was by being the servant of many. By constantly adding value to others, you get value come back to you. It becomes the most natural thing.Tony Robbins has his critics I am sure. But I know he has helped me get through a hard time 13 years ago, maybe even saving my life. I know he has helped others. People always seem to be afraid to admit it. I know I almost feel ashamed to say I needed help.But it's by helping others and accepting help that we grow as a society. Sometimes people think ""choosing myself"" is a selfish concept. But it's the only way you build the strength to help others. It's the only way you surrender to not some man-made force, but a force inside yourself that is perhaps the most powerful there is.Claudia and I left his house and drove around and around talking about what the interview meant to us. And I guess we still are.[Here is the link to the podcast: http://bit.ly/1t8RJ80]",2014-11-19T12:28:34.000Z
And Then I Held A Glass Of Water To Her Lips...,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141117151454-5858595-and-then-i-held-a-glass-of-water-to-her-lips-while-she-was-tied-up?trk=mp-reader-card,59303,162,79,2014-11-17 00:00:00,11.0,"I wanted to make money. When I moved to NYC to get a fulltime job I was rich. I was making $40,000 a year. This was a huge move up from my prior salary of $28,300 a year.I thought I should be able to hire a butler on that kind of money.I bought a suit. I started looking at nice apartments. I figure I could afford the massive budget of $800 a month, give or take a ""few hundred"".One time there was an apartment available uptown. I met the real estate guy. While we were checking out the apartment he accidentally dropped his suitcase and about a dozen porn magazines fell out. He apologized while he picked them up and stuffed them back into this suitcase.I couldn't afford his fee of 5% of the year's rent. I had no money other than what was coming up on my next paycheck.So I lived with my parents which meant I had to get on a bus at 6am and I didn't get back from the city until about 10pm each day.Finally, I was hanging around Washington Sq Park doing nothing and I met Elias and he needed a roommate. It was just $300 a month. I got the futon and he got the couch. It was one room. The broken shower was constantly running and the kitchen was so bad I didn't set foot in it once.We kept different hours so I was usually asleep when he got home. With a girl.He and the girl would go into the bathroom and start having sex with her perched on him while the wall pushed back and forth, as if it were ready to burst and they would fall right through. My bed was against the wall and I'd try to sleep but also I'd stay up and listen.Elias was a strong chessplayer and made his money gambling chess in the park. His brother Jorge maybe is the most talented chessplayer in history but never really pursued the game after he was a teenager.One time I was sick and in the middle of the night Elias woke me and told me we were getting kicked out of the apartment.Then I decided I needed to make even more money.Nobody had websites then. I thought this was a big problem that I wanted to solve. Everyone needed a website.My brother-in-law and I did a website for a diamond wholesaler on 47th street. ""If you tell anyone you are doing this website,"" he said, in his thick Russian-Jewish accent, ""I'm going to have to kill you."" People say that as a joke but he was serious.And now he's dead. He was looking for diamonds in an obscure part of Russia and his plane crashed.Nobody on the street (known as the Diamond District in NYC) was allowed to know that a wholesaler was selling direct through the Internet. We charged $35,000 for that.My take was $17,500 which I used to pay for a year's rent at the Chelsea Hotel in NYC.It was all cash. I gave it to the owner of the Chelsea in a paper bag and he said, ""are you a drug dealer?"" I don't think he was asking this to see if I should live in his building or not. I think he was just curious.Then we did HBO's website for close to $100,000. I was working at HBO and outsourced the site to my brother in law. Then we did AmericanExpress.com and LoudRecords.com, BadBoy, NewLine, and Miramax.com and TimeWarner.com and websites for The Matrix, the Wu-Tang Clan, Con Edison, and many others. We were in business.I worked all day at HBO and then all night at Reset, the name of the company. We got an office, then we got a bigger office. We had big parties.Maybe five other companies knew how to do websites in NYC at the time and we were the smallest but I like to think we did the most creative sites.We did a site called ""Shoebox"". I asked one of my neighbors at the Chelsea, who was a professional submissive, if she would let us photograph and interview her and her girlfriend, a professional dominatrix who was around 7 feet tall and had some sort of extra chromosome that enlarged everything about her and made her constantly lactate.They came over to our office where we had a big photo studio and they had about 20 pairs of shoes and all of their lingerie. The highlight for me was holding a glass of water up to Maria's lips when she was completely tied up and thirsty in between takes.The site was so popular that Con Edison came over and said, ""that's what we want our website to look like.""Nobody knew what they were doing.It's hard to be a first-time entrepreneur. I should've made our services into a product, for instance, raised money, and aimed for a big IPO.Instead we sold for a multiple of our profits. Maybe the only Internet company back then that was profitable. Stupid.I knew technology but I knew zero about business. I wish I had just even one mentor then who could've told me about the business side of things.We also wanted to try out different ideas. While we were running a website business we also tried to be a rap label, a producer of TV shows, and even a tea company.We found a rap group we liked and almost signed them but then lost interest.About half the companies we worked with had employees who asked for bribes in order to throw business our way. ""Bribe"" is a strong word. Sometimes it was more subtle. ""Favor"". Nevertheless, we always paid the bribe.Humiliation was common for me. I'd fly out to California to pitch Jim Carrey's agent about doing his website. ""This is going to be HUGE!"" his agent said. ""you HAVE to go to a party with us later tonight."" And an hour later I would call for directions to the party and the agent would say, ""Wait, wait, wait a sec. Who is this?""Another time I hired someone to be CEO while I was still working full-time. He's a good guy but I didn't understand how to make a deal. He wanted 10% of the company that would vest in six months. In six months and one day he took his 10% and quit and made a sitcom for MTV.Water under the bridge. We're good friends today.We felt like we were the wild west. Rappers with guns would stroll into our offices. Trent Reznor would hang out throwing around ideas for the Nine Inch Nails website.Miramax executives would scream at me over the phone if one pixel was out of place on their logo. One day we spent the day tasting different teas. We wanted to pitch Honest Tea but it didn't work out.Clients would get shot and killed at awards ceremonies in the music industry. HBO one time wanted to buy us but that's when I had to admit that I was at both places and had to quit working at HBO.My first day on the job I cried because I had no idea what to do or who to do it to and people stopped returning my calls after I left HBO.Then we started getting calls to get acquired. One guy said, ""I don't know a hamburger from a website but I know that a stock with an Internet company is going to go up."" He was from a company that manufactured burn gels and they wanted to buy us so they could put "".com"" at the end of their name.I went on a vacation to Paris. There's a restaurant at the bottom of the Eiffel Tower. The guy sitting next to us was celebrating. He had just sold a chain of Papa John's pizza stores. When I got back to New York he kept calling me and wanted to invest. Maybe he would've been my smart investor but we never took in any money.Eventually we sold. Eventually people realized that it doesn't cost $75,000 to make a three page website about Dennis Miller. Eventually the entire web design business went bankrupt as an industry before it reinvented itself as ""full services"" in the Internet space.I didn't know what to do after we sold the company. I felt totally lost.I had money and it seemed lonely sitting in a bank account. So I bought a house. I rode helicopters every week to Atlantic City. I made a lot of new friends who all wanted something and none of them speak to me anymore.I played poker every night for 365 straight days. ""Ingrid says hi"", Brian Koppelman, the writer of Rounders, wrote me the other day. Ingrid was usually in charge of the Mayfair Club, the best poker club in NY in 1999. Portrayed by Famke Jannsen in the movie.Every day was a mask to fool someone into having a relationship with me. Into doing business with me. Into not firing me. Into buying my company.When I actually had to ""be myself"" I went broke and lost all of my relationships almost instantly.I no longer even speak to my partners in the business, all of whom are blood relatives. I was drinking, gambling, running businesses into the ground, spending, and betraying.I could say, ""I wish someone had given me advice"" during this time but perhaps many people tried to.I wish I could say, ""I listened"" but I honestly didn't have the ability to listen. I didn't even know what listening meant.Listening is a more difficult skill than ""Doing"". Because you know the difference between ""done"" and ""not done"". But there's no line that tells you whether you listened or not.This is the entire reason why the self-help business is a scam.There's absolutely nothing that could've helped me. I would later lie down in the street and pray for a car to run over me while my baby girls were upstairs playing.I wish I could re-live the entire experience. Like the blizzard of 1996 when we all went to work at midnight to finish a website and it felt so good to deliver. Or when I was scared I'd have to fire everyone because I lost a big client and didn't tell anyone. Now when people ask me what I would do differently I always say the same answer, ""I wouldn't change a thing"".",2014-11-17T15:14:54.000Z
10 Things More Valuable Than Money,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141110143502-5858595-10-things-more-valuable-than-money?trk=mp-reader-card,83270,1321,414,2014-11-10 00:00:00,11.0,"I lost $15mm cash in one summer. It was about a million a week and then it picked up speed. Ugh, I'm like reading the newspaper twice. I know I've written about this before.But bear with me.I bought a house. I invested in bad companies. I started worse companies. I bought art. I took A LOT of helicopters.I thought about money all the time. I wanted to make $100 million. Then...I thought...I can finally feel like I achieved something.That's how stupid I was. I then lost my house, lost my marriage, lost my friends, lost my family, lost a lot of opportunities.It was only when I found things more valuable than money that I was able to easily make money. Money is a byproduct of the following:Ten things more valuable than money.A) One 5 minute call with my daughter instead of doing a 5 minute call about business with someone I don't like.PLEASE GOD, give me the strength to not take the five minute call with the person I don't like.I can lose all the money in the world but I can make it back. I will NEVER get back the 5 minutes I could've spent with my daughters.Children want someone to tell their stories to. I make her laugh. 5 minutes of making her laugh she will remember forever.She will say at my deathbed, ""He always made me laugh"", but only if I devote those 5 minutes to her. That's more valuable than money.B) Writing down ideasI like to write down ten ideas a day. That's 3,650 ideas a year. I do it on a waiter's pad. I have over 100 waiter's pads in my closet.Ideas are more valuable than money. Income has gone down versus inflation for 40 years.And people say ideas are a ""dime a dozen"". I can tell you this is not true. Pick any concept. Like say, ""10 ideas of novels I can write"". Maybe the first 3 might be easy (""a dime for three ideas""). But ten starts to get difficult.Then people say ""execution is everything"". This is so wrong.First, you can't execute without a decent idea to begin with.Second, execution ideas are a subset of ideas.Let's say I have a good idea for a novel. Now my next execution step is to have ideas for all the chapters. An outline. Then my next execution step is to have ideas for when I will write. And so on.Money lasts for a few seconds in my hands. But ideas can grow and build and spread and touch everyone I know and then everyone they know.C) Ideas for Other peopleI had $0 in the bank in 2008 when I was getting my divorce. I had almost zero friends because I was so ashamed of my circumstances I was afraid to tell anyone. ""You mean it happened to you AGAIN!?"" they would say.Then I started to make money.How did I start making money? I started sending ""10 Ideas to Make X Better"". Where X might be a person or a business. Then I would send to X.One out of 50 would respond. But that's ok. That's all it takes to make millions.D) Persistence is more valuable than moneyIn the above case I had to (and still do) send out 100s of emails. I had to do hours of research to come up with ideas. I had to go to meetings without any clue what the outcome would be.But persistence let me touch people. Persistence let me share my ideas. Persistence got people excited about those ideas. Persistence got me paid for those ideas.E) Physical HealthI can get in the car, drive two miles to the gym, and then walk on the treadmill for two miles while watching about Ebola on CNN in front of me.Or I can sleep well, eat well, and take a few healthy walks during the week.Sometimes Claudia, my wife, makes me do yoga with her. Ok, I can do that also. Sometimes I think I'm very good at it when I finally touch my toes.I don't care how long I live. If I die tomorrow I feel like I've lived a life worth living. But I do want quality of life until I die. My father spent the last two years of his life staring at a ceiling because he was paralyzed from a stroke.I keep healthy because if you spend two years of your life staring at a ceiling, money is worth zero.F) LaughingGuess what? Kids laugh on average 300 times a day. Adults laugh on average....5 times a day.What the hell happened?I can't pay people to laugh. Money doesn't make me laugh. Except when I'm bathing in it and pretending to be Dr. Evil.Laughter is linked to all sorts of things that make you healthier. Like it releases oxytocin throughout the body which gives feelings of happiness and calmness. I have to give a TEDx talk later. I need to laugh before then. Here's my go-to laugh items of the day: ",2014-11-10T14:35:02.000Z
Do You Have A Scheme Or A Theme?,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141107143014-5858595-do-you-have-a-scheme-or-a-theme?trk=mp-reader-card,13780,219,63,2014-11-07 00:00:00,10.0,"When I met with Bernie Madoff to see if he would put money into my hedge fund I had no idea he had a scheme.Everyone said later, ""We always knew"". But on the way to the meeting, those same people were calling me and saying, ""ask him if we could invest.""They would deny it now of course. Not because they lie or they are bad (who can judge another?) but maybe they now keep secrets from themselves or maybe they are afraid. We are all afraid sometimes.Like when we meet the girl and tell of our accomplishments but leave out the time our hand went through a window in an argument with a very similar girl.When I left Madoff's office I was depressed. ""How can I ever raise money with men like Madoff around?""I didn't have a theme then. I had my own scheme. To raise money. So I could feed my family. So I could live. So I could have significance among my friends. So they could beg to invest with me. So maybe other women would love me. So maybe I could live in a bigger place. Or have bigger friends.I didn't know what a theme was. I just felt fear all the time.Where is the food? Where is the affection? Every barter had fear hidden inside of it.Think of it. Yesterday, you were a spy. What secrets of the universe did you withhold from the people around you?You graduate from schemes to themes when you have a vision that helps people.""I have a new method that will help people make money.""""I have a new way to help my colleagues"".""I have a new way for people to share information with friends.""""I have a way to feed millions of people and build schools for them.""""I have a new method for helping people be healthy or loved.""""I have a new way to make people laugh.""""I have new ways to help people realize their own visions. To lead their own businesses. To turn ideas into money into charity.""""I have a new way for two, three, ten people to connect and share and help each other.""We were each handed out two eyes and then shot like a bullet into the world. Our only job: to report back what we see. Each eye is unique. Each vision is unique.A vision is giving because we only create value for ourselves when we create more value for others. Else it's a scheme.A vision is large. Else it falls back into the market, everyone selling the same commodities back and forth to each other just so they can live one more day.A vision excites others. Because they have their own visions and you can trigger a spark that lets them set their vision on fire with yours.A vision doesn't worry about money or love. Those are byproducts of vision. When you can feed the herd, trust that the herd will feed you back.I've had themes and I've had schemes. When you work with a scheme you are constantly worried they will figure you out.When I've worked on things I really believe in, visions that have the attributes above, there is no sense of worry, no sense that I have to get on and get out as quickly as possible.When I was working on my first successful business I felt like everyone needed to have their own websites. I wanted everyone in the world to have one. I would do websites for free for billion dollar companies because I wanted them to have one. That gave me up to 1000 employees until the theme turned into a scheme like many themes do.Themes need to change because what we see in the world around us changes. Every day we wake up and the sun is rising and there are either clouds or no clouds, good weather or bad. You have to dress for the weather based on what you see.A theme adds value to others. A scheme only adds value to ourselves. Schemes ultimately fail.Is this a rant or a story? I don't know.One time I was on a date. The girl got a call in the middle of the date. She took the call right in front of me, in the middle of dinner.""I'm on a date with that guy I told you about,"" she said. Then she listened. Then she said, ""I don't know. At first I thought he was ugly but now I don't think so anymore.""Then I moved to sit down side by side with her.That's a story. And it didn't end well.I believe everyone has a vision. The sky is always blue, even if the clouds seem perpetually in front of it, blocking you from that blue.Trust that when you you live by a theme, you choose yourself, you get super powers, and then you help others choose themselves.Then you can finally see the vast blue, stretched out into infinity that you can paint on. Turn your scheme into a theme.At first you were ugly. Then I thought you were beautiful.",2014-11-07T14:30:14.000Z
The Ultimate Cheat Sheet for Investing All of...,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141103140848-5858595-the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-investing-all-of-your-money?trk=mp-reader-card,44941,699,202,2014-11-03 00:00:00,11.0,"In the history of capitalism, this is the hardest time ever to invest. People are going broke, losing their jobs, and fear more than greed rules the news and tries to rule thoughts.In short: people are scared. And I do think the uncertainty is going to rise quickly so I wanted to put this note together.In 2001 and 2002 I lost all my money through bad investing. The same thing happened to me on a couple of occasions after that.So why should anyone listen to me about investing? You shouldnt. You shouldnt listen to anyone at all about investing. This is your hard-earned money. Dont blow it by listening to an idiot like me.The most important three words in investing is: I dont know. If someone doesnt say that to you then they are lying.I was preparing this morning for my podcast conversation I am having tomorrow with Stephen Dubner, co-author of Freakonomics and the upcoming Think Like a Freak. One of the statistics he points out is that CXO Advisory Group polled the predictions of 500 investment strategists and pundits. The experts had a 47% success rate. Good luck if you listen to any of them.Heres my experience (and perhaps Ive learned the hard way about what NOT to do and a little bit about what TO do.):Ive run a hedge fund that was successful. I ran a fund of hedge funds, which means Ive probably analyzed the track records and strategies of about 1000 different hedge funds.Ive learned ONE MAJOR THING, which I will repeat below: ALL OF WALL STREET IS A SCAM. There are zero exceptions.Ive been a venture capitalist and a successful angel investor (I was a HORRIBLE venture capitalist though  but I put that under the category of does not work well with others).I cant raise money anymore. Nor do I want to play that game. I dont BS about my losses and everyone else does.So Im not in that business anymore. Its too much work to run a fund anyway.In the past 15 years Ive tried every investing strategy out there. I honestly cant think of a strategy I havent experimented with.Ive also wrote software to trade the markets automatically and I did very well with that but that industry is now dominated by the high frequency guys.And Ive written several books on my experiences investing, with topics ranging from automatic investing to Warren Buffett, to hedge funds, to long-term investing (my worse-selling book, The Forever Portfolio, which has sold 399 copies since it came out in December 2008, including one copy for the entire last quarter).Incidentally, why publish a book called The Forever Portfolio during the worst financial crisis in history. I begged my publisher (Penguin) to postpone but they couldnt. Its in the schedule was their magic incantation. Publishers largely suck. The good news is: they will never make back the advance.That said, all of the picks in that book have done excellently since then (Claudia proved this in a review of the book on Amazon but then was shamed into admitting she was my wife, which she did not at first disclose) but the one thing I am proud of is that I made a crossword puzzle for the book. I dont know of any other investing book with a crossword puzzle in it.So, Ok! Lets get started. Dont follow any of my advice. This is advice that I do and follow and it works for me.A) Should I Daytrade?Only if you are also willing to take all of your money, rip it into tiny pieces, make cupcakes with one piece of money inside each cupcake and then eat all of the cupcakes.Then you will get sick, and eat all of your money, but it will taste thrilling along the way. Which is what daytrading is.B) I Don't Believe You. Many People Daytrade For A Living.No. I personally know of two. Maybe three. And they work 24 hours a day at it and have been doing it for a decade or more. So unless you want to put in that amount of time and be willing to lose a lot first then you shouldnt do it.One more thing: when you daytrade and lose money its not like a job.When you go into a job you NEVER lose money. If you show up for two weeks, you get paid. Even if you have been warned repeatedly about sexual harassment you still get paid. You might get fired but they wont take your money.The stock market TAKES your money on bad days.Sometimes it takes a lot of your money. Were not used to the brutality of that and it can destroy a person psychologically, which makes one (me) trade even worse.C) Well, Who Makes Money In The Market Then?Three types of people:",2014-11-03T14:08:48.000Z

Nobody knew about the ""World Wide Web"" but they would within the year.All the porn shops on 42nd street were shut down but they had yet to be destroyed. I had left my friends behind in another city and had yet to meet a single new friend.All I cared about was playing chess, writing, and meeting girls, in reverse order.I'd dress up in my one suit, take the bus for 1.5 hours into NYC, and stumble out of Grand Central to walk to the two blocks to HBO, a company where every day I was on the verge of getting fired my first six months there. 10,000 other people swarming in the same direction, in their same suits.To make friends I'd introduce myself to everyone who would make eye contact with me. I think I asked every girl I saw out on a date, including the girl behind the plate glass counter I had to pay when my phone bill was late. (She said, ""Yes"", we went on one date, and she stopped returning my calls).Like anyone in their 20s I wanted to change the world, create art, and get rich. Or maybe just one of those. I had no idea. Maybe even more important: I was just lonely and wanted someone to touch.The world seemed like a dream to me. Leaving the bus station I'd think to myself, ""I'm in the FAMOUS New York City."" It was a champagne bottle waiting to pop and I was the cork, ready to fly into space.I think Disney owned the porn shops on 42nd Street and big plans were being made. We were all at the beginning of BIG PLANS.But this was in that gray transition period. I can't think of a day in 1994 that wasn't gray. Half dark, half light.And it was during this time that each porn shop, for whatever reason, had a haiku on them.For a very brief time, the wisdom of a god was scrawled onto each porn front. Everyone who had to squeeze their way down 42nd Street into the vast wide opening of the ""real world"" had to read these messages from above.Here's one of those haikus and I still have it hanging by my desk.",2014-10-27T13:22:44.000Z

And I couldn't sleep at night until I gave back every dollar to the people who gave it to me.I was running the sort of fund where people gave me money and then I invested it in other funds. The only problem was, I couldn't figure out what funds were total scams and what funds were legit. In retrospect, I think about 9 or 10 of the 12 funds I was invested in were total scams.For instance, and this is all in the SEC filings, one fund manager stole $10 million from his fund that I was invested in. He then paid a $50,000 fine when he was caught. Now he's nowhere. I mean, he's somewhere but I can't find him. We're Facebook friends but the last update was him sitting on a beach and it was updated about five years ago.My investors were furious. They had been making money every month with me. They didn't want their money back. When I told them I was going to give them their money back, with profits, they were so upset many of them didn't want me to take a fee.In every business I had ever started, even ones that had totally failed, I had kept good relations with the investors. Except for this one. Not a single relationship survived even though I had made money for everyone.When you can't figure out how you are making money. It's time to change.In 1998 when kids in high school were learning how to make websites, I sold my website design business for $15 million. Two years later almost all website design businesses were out of business.And now in 2006, when no matter how hard I tried to figure it out it seemed like the world economy had gone crazy and I didn't understand how these funds were making money. I pulled out all the money.But I needed something to do or I would quickly go broke. I don't want to act here like I was totally altruistic. I was so miserable all the time. I felt like I had failed and I was also having problems in my marriage. The sort of problems where you'd get in an argument and get kicked out of a car in the middle of nowhere.I decided to do the only thing I knew how to do and the only thing that has ever made me money ever.I took one thing I loved and married it to another thing I loved. And, thus, created a new thing. I loved Internet businesses, having built and sold one. And I loved the financial business, despite the fact that it was almost all a scam.  I shut down my fund.Then, each step that follows was critical to success. If I missed one of these steps I would've failed. Each step was a small step. If you focus on big steps, you'll slip on the small steps.1) I spec-ed out a website I wanted to make: a financial site that had no news on it but was focused on building community by exchanging ideas. I wanted to give people a way to make good decisions on their own.When I say ""spec"", I wrote down what all the buttons on the front page would do and what other content would appear on the front page. I completely defined the next five layers of the site and what buttons and actions and content would occur on each page.2) Once I had the spec, I went to a firm in India and asked them to design five pages of the website. Just the design. No code. This cost me $500.3) I showed a potential distribution partner (thestreet.com) those pages and worked out a deal where they would help me get traffic AND they would place ads in exchange for 50% ownership. They had a billion pageviews a year so I said, ""YES!!"" (Actually, not quite true. I said, I was thinking 3% ownership for them and Tom said, ""No, 50%"" and then I said, ""YES!!"")4) I paid the Indian firm to finish the site. This cost $2000. Then I came up with more ideas for the site and more ideas and more ideas and although we did a soft launch at version 1.0, we did a hard launch at version 5.0 about five months later.5) I got my friends to use the site. First I created over 700 fake users and manually entered in probably over 10,000 pieces of data onto the site just to make it useful right away. Don't be afraid to do things manually to get things going on your site. Even with user-generated content it's ok if you are the first 1000 users if you expect a million users to benefit from it.Every successful business, even Google, Facebook, Twitter, started with a combination of manual improvements and friends of the founders using the site. I got my friends to write reviews of the site on their popular blogs. I wrote articles that would link back to the useful content on the site. I guest blogged on many different websites. This is how you get users back to your site.Everyone asks me, ""how do I get users to my site"". The above is the answer. It's the only answer.Don't forget: when you start a website, it's not yet a trusted site. So you have to bring people from a trusted site to your site to build up the trust in your site.This is true for any site: financial sites, bird-watching sites, weight loss sites, sports sites, whatever. I created three areas of community on the site: a way for people to message and have ""friends"". A user-generated forum system, and a Q&amp;A system. The Q&amp;A system in particular generated 40% of the traffic the day after it launched. I had ads on every page at this point. A million users a month. And no employees. So we were profitable. We were making about $100,000 a month with zero employees in just four months. Being too afraid to build this into a big business, I sold the site almost instantly.I could've used other examples. I could've used the debit card business I started. The delivery service I started. The mental health hospital I was involved in. The billion revenues business I'm on the board of directors of and the many other businesses I've advised and consulted with and invested in.But the lessons are all the same.LESSONS LEARNED GET DOWN ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES AND SCRUB. Even when something is scalable, don't be afraid to get down on your hands and knees and be the first part of that scaling. Don't expect anonymous users to do all your initial hard work. Don't expect computers to do all your initial hard work.YOU do all your initial hard work. FREE CONTENT ON THE FRONT PAGE. I had so much free content available it obscured the design. Everyone cares too much about design. Value is 10x more important than design. OUTSOURCE IN INCREMENTAL STAGES. First we designed pages, then after we knew we were going to get big distribution, we made the rest of the site. Then, based on user feedback and more ideas, we designed four more versions before an official launch. The site changed drastically from version 1.0 to version 5.0. DIVERSIFY YOUR DISTRIBUTION. Although there was one primary source of distribution (thestreet.com) where I was getting traffic from, I also worked out deals to get traffic from AOL. Yahoo, Forbes, Reuters, and basic advertising. HERE'S HOW TO NOT WORRY ABOUT COMPETITION. I had competition but they were doing the ""build it and they will come"" technique. 95% of businesses forget that it's important to be the first heavy users of your product.A restaurant is a great example of this. The initial success of a pizza restaurant doesn't depend just on how good the pizza is, but how many of your friends and their friends come in the door to buy it. Don't be afraid to call everyone in your rolodex to come on over and try the pizza.Actually, this is not quite true either. When I first realized I had competition, I cried. I actually called the developers in India and told them it was all over. They had to cheer me up. One thing I learned ultimately, was that the biggest asset the business had was the passion my partner and I had for it. That passion was much higher than the passion of our competitors so we ended up creating and implementing the best ideas. End of competition. I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE. I cold-called Yahoo, AOL, and Forbes to get on their radar.In fact, I had a ""negative network"". The first guy I called at Yahoo said he knew me. ""Oh yeah?"" I said because I had no idea who he was.He said, ""yeah, I invested in your wireless Internet business and lost my investment.""You would think that would have hurt my chances. Yahoo became one of my biggest sources of distribution after that call. That guy became my biggest advocate within Yahoo.The key is to anticipate what they might want, show them how it will cost them nothing but they will get huge benefit from it, and then just simply do it. Make it as easy as possible for the other side to say ""yes"" before you ask them.If you want someone to say ""yes"", show them exactly what ""yes"" looks like and show them that it is already made. COMBINE INTERESTS. I had been 20 years already in the technology business (since I was in college). And I had been in the financial industry for about seven years then. So I combined interests and made the best financial website. Nobody else was as well-placed in this intersection as I was. MAKE THE BUSINESS YOU WOULD USE. I wanted a site with no news, but tons of interesting ideas, perspectives, ideas, and community.Investing based on news is the fastest way to poverty but it is very common in the hedge fund business for professional investors to call each other and exchange ideas. Hedge fund managers are on the phone all day with each other.I made it very simple for everyone, and not just hedge fund managers, to do that online. ABD. Always be dealmaking. Even though I had a 50% distribution partner right from the beginning I was constantly meeting with companies and people to see what extra deals I could make.I would come up with ideas about the value I could deliver them and then I would offer up that value. Maybe they needed a white label version of my site. Maybe they needed content from my site. Maybe they needed their blog to be distributed on my site, maybe they wanted their newsletter sold on my site.I did any deal I could do. Until finally I sold the site. But that wasn't even the final deal. I stuck with it and the site continued to grow. NOTHING IS A STRAIGHT LINE. There were constant cases where the code was bad on the site and the site would crash if it had too many users at the same time. Every other week I thought I was going to have a heart attack because the site kept crashing.And some companies were very slow to do deals with me. Some companies outright rejected me (Google). You can't be bitter or burn bridges. There may come another day, another company, or all the people at Google might move to other places where you do business with. The key here is to always stay in touch and provide monthly updates showing how you are improving things. Always be willing to help people no matter what. HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN TO GIVE UP?Every step of the way I was willing to give up if I didn't see some form of traction. Sometimes that meant more users. Sometimes that meant more profits. Sometimes that meant more technology that I really liked and ideas implemented that people wrote great reviews about. BUILD COMMUNITY BY HAND. I traveled around the country holding meetups with the most active users so I could see with my own eyes how the site was helping people. It was exciting to me. As long as I had that excitement, I knew something was working.The people who showed up at those meetups became almost like ambassadors for the site. They were so active they used the site more than me. Nothing beats face to face meeting to build your ambassadors.Why did I go myself to most of these meetups?There's a saying in Argentina, ""When the CEO is looking, the cow grows fatter"". A business builds fastest when the CEO is looking at it. There's a thousand details that the CEO sees. There's 100 details that the COO sees. There's 10 details that the regular employee sees. And details slip through the cracks when there is nobody.At the same time I had also started a dating site (or four) and none of them got traction even though the sites were beautiful and I had smoked my own crack and thought the businesses were great. But no users equals no traction.Perseverance is like a fire that needs oxygen.Love is the oxygen for perseverance. You can love it. Users can love it. Partners can love it. Investors can love it. There are a lot of sources of love. Businesses and humans need love to live.Ultimately, you create value for people and that's how you build the love.Business is just the delivery mechanism of that love.Then love + perseverance = abundance.I sold that business for $10 million and then two years later I was dead broke because once again I forgot all about love. I squandered the love.So I had to start from scratch again. Which I did.",2014-09-12T13:26:00.000Z

Blech!Taxes and money are a very emotional issue for many people. Some people wrote me angry letters. In two cases I wrote back, Please reread the article and then they reread and apologized.How come they apologized? Because they didnt read it. They just projected their own anger onto my article and then onto me. Thats what most people do all of the time. They are sick but they puke on you.They wanted to provoke a response from me. They wanted to control me.I have two challenges: not letting people control me, and not trying to control anyone else. When I succeed at these two things, life is pretty good.The first time I ever made a lot of money, it did not make me free. It cost me my freedom. Before I had money I had a lot of friends, I did what I wanted on weekends and at nights, I had fun.After I had money I started thinking I needed to make more money. A LOT more money. I started buying things I couldnt really afford. I felt people wouldnt like me if I didnt have these things.I started lending money out to friends and family in the hopes of helping them. I thought people would like me if I saved them.NOBODY will ever remember how you helped them. And you cant save anyone. This was my first lesson.My second lesson is that I never really owned anything. When I owned a house I became slave to the bank, slave to the government, slave to upkeep of the house, slave to the other people living in the house (my family, who I became afraid would be homeless).Third, I let money control who I associated with. Eventually I ended up with no friends or family. The people I truly loved at the time, I lost. I still regret it.I was afraid of consequences. I was afraid to lose everything even though I had already lost it.I sold everything. I had to give up many of my friendships and even many of my family relationships. I disappointed probably everyone. But it was the only way I could get free and start from scratch.Once I started from scratch I was able to begin the long process of reinventing myself.I probably own nothing right now except some clothes and some books. And all my relationships, 100% of the people I talk with, are only with people I choose to talk to.If someone in my life tries to control me because of their own fears and angers, then they are out.I also try to not control anyone else. If someone does something I dont like, I cant control what they think or do.Its useless and its a waste of my time. I try to change my circumstances so I dont have to deal with those people.What if you are stuck in a job and have bills to pay because of past mistakes? You have to work for your freedom then. And its an ongoing process. Its every day.The key to freedom is Luck. But luck is not magic.Luck equals 1. Persistence plus 2. Diversification.",2014-09-03T13:26:59.000Z

I take naps during the day. Sometimes I start businesses that fail. I often go down paths that lead to dead ends. OFTEN.At the same time, I'm on the board of some very successful companies. I'm a successful investor. I write a lot. I have a top podcast (e.g. more than 15 people listen to it). I look at my calendar for next week and everything I'm doing is something I love doing. It took me a long time to build up to this level of productivity but that's because I wasn't doing so well the things I list below.I wish I had started doing these things earlier.Most important: I love my wife and I think she loves me. Sometimes I don't know if she loves me.Perhaps my most unproductive time is when I am wondering if she loves me.I always need to work better at wondering what people think of me. We are trained by evolution to wonder. Don't feel bad for yourself if you wonder too much. Blame evolution.But I like to do the opposite of evolution here and be fine regardless.I also get annoyed at my kids sometimes. This is very unproductive. Like, if one is late and I'm just sitting in the car. But I have a trick for making that time in my life productive as long as I'm not yelling at her or getting angry.Anger is never productive. Some people are foolish and think that anger drives them forward but it doesn't. Anger stabs at your heart and then your heart closes. You need your heart to be open.How come? Because neurons transmit messages from your gut to your heart to your head.Everything needs to be open so your neurochemicals transmit messages efficiently.So the first question is: what is productive?I like to be in love with people and my favorite hobbies. Then I like to be moving forward at those things. And all other times I like to be sleeping or thinking of nothing.This is not a goal but a theme. I live life by themes. If today I live by my themes then I have a good day.That is success for me.What are side effects of success? Kissing and sex and smiling. Some laughing. Talking to people who make me think. Reading about interesting things.Feeling that fire-like feeling in my chest when I'm doing something I'm proud of. And money is a side-effect.Note that money is not a goal.Having money as a goal makes it very hard to make money. Money is a side effect of the daily routine I am about to tell you.You can say, ""you need money to pay bills."" Yes, sometimes it's been very hard for me to pay bills. In my life I have been in pain often over how to live with no money. But I've NEVER made money without it being a side effect of a successful routine.And when I have bad routines, I lose all my money. Simple.These are all just side effects. And they are all happening in my life right now.MY ROUTINE:First off, I'm going to love you today. I picture you, the reader, and I'm in love with you. I'm grateful you are reading this. I do this with completely selfish reasons.This makes a flood of oxytocin trigger in my brain so I can keep writing this and I'm happy doing it.I woke up at 5:30am. I read books and had coffee. Oh, and I did about 30 pushups but then it got too hard for me so I'll do more later. It would be great if I could do 6000 pushups but I can't. I'll just do what I can.What books did I read?",2014-08-22T13:32:45.000Z

The hedge fund manager asked me how much money I had in the bank.I had ZERO but I said, a million dollars. This was in 2002.In the prior two years I had lost all the money I ever made and my home. Now I was broke.He said, how can you afford to live on that?Which strikes me as ludicrous now but I felt every blood cell in me turn upside down in shame then.I felt he would think it was courageous if I threw the question back at him.Well, how much money do you have?He said, one hundred million dollars. Who knows?One friend of mine told me something, you can never tell how much money someone has until they file for bankruptcy.I read a statistic that people lie (including white lies), on average, 10-200 times a day. I also read that people say, on average, 2500 words a day.So one technique to stop lying is to stop talking. I try not to talk. I try to say around 1000 words a day.The hedge fund manager and I then went out to dinner with his wife. He was cheating on his wife but I didnt know that yet.I had read all his favorite books so I was able to quote from them. What are your favorite books? he said. I quoted from those books (Ayn Rand). Then I quoted from a research paper he wrote in 1969 that I had found buried in some journal.He asked me, What are my interests outside of finance? I knew he liked baseball so I talked about various histories of baseball I had just read. Baseball is boring.The hedge fund manager gave me money to manage. It was my first job in the financial space. In a very short time I more than doubled the money he had given me.A year or so later I wrote a book about how I did it. He instantly fired me. He thought I had revealed too much. He wrote, our financial relationship is now over.I wrote, its not. You owe me money because I have made you so much. So he instantly sent a check.One day, I had to return my dads car to the dealership. My dad had a stroke and was in a coma and would never drive a car again. After I dropped it off the hedge fund manager called me and invited me to dinner.I went to the dinner and started drinking quite a bit. I was feeling depressed.To my right was the mistress. And in front of me was the hedge fund managers daughter.I was shy and had a crush on the daughter and so I blurted out the only question I could think of, so what do you think of [manager] and [mistress] being so out in the open?[Daughter] looked at [mistress] and said, I think she is a money hungry slut. And then she got up and walked out of the restaurant .I was horrified and embarrassed. [The wife] even wrote me the next day and was upset at me and [manager] was upset at me until finally I said to everyone, this is your family issue. I have my own family issues.Anyway, my book came out right after that and I was fired.All of this is to say, better to speak fewer words.Less lies, more time to listen and learn and think and daydream. Less embarrassing situations. Less masks to wear. My mental closet can only fit so many masks. The older I get, the less masks fit in that closet.More benefits of not opening your mouth: flies dont get in your mouth. Less food gets in your mouth so you eat better.You give less advice. Nobody listens to my advice anyway. People do what they want until they are injured like a kid putting his fingers on the stove.Telling the truth is easier. It means you just have to remember things.Telling a lie means you have to remember, AND THEN keep track of the lie. Too much stress! (Polygraph machines, in fact, work by measuring stress levels).Less mouth means you start to use your eyes and ears more. Like the way blind people can hear and touch better.Blind people seem to develop super powers with their other senses.People who talk less are like superheroes in the same way.If you become a superhero and see me lying homeless in the gutter, please save me.",2014-08-18T13:40:31.000Z

Its like weightlifting. When you lift slightly more than you can handle, you get stronger. In life, when the gun is to your head, you either figure it out, or you die.When you cut yourself open, you bleed ideas. If youre broke and close to death, you have to start coming up with ideas.If you destroy your life, you need to come up with ideas to rebuild it.The only time Ive been FORCED to have good ideas is when I was up against the wall.My life insurance policy was like a gun to my head: Come up with good ideas OR ELSE your kids get your life insurance!At an airport when I realized a business I had been working on for four years was worthless.Or when I was sitting in the dark at three in the morning in the living room of the house I was going bankrupt and losing my home, my brain figuring out how to die without anyone knowing it was planned.Or when I was getting a divorce and I was lonely and afraid I wouldnt make any money again or I wouldnt meet anyone again. Or my kids would hate me. Or my friends would be disgusted by me.The problem is this: youre NOT in a state of panic most of the time. States of panic are special and have to be revered. Think about the times in your life that you remember  its exactly those moments when you hit bottom and were forced to come up with ideas, to get stronger, to connect with some inner force inside you with the outer force.This is why its important NOW to strengthen that connection to that idea force inside of you. This post is about HOW.Nothing you ever thought of before amounted to anything  thats why you are exactly where you are at that moment of hitting bottom. Because all of your billions of thoughts have led you to right there. You cant trust the old style of thinking anymore. They came, they saw, they lost.You have to come up with a new way of thinking. A new way of having ideas. A new ways of interacting with the outside universe.Youre in crisis. Time to change. Time to become an IDEA MACHINE.People know what runners high is. Its when you are running for a long time, at the point of exhaustion, and then something kicks in and gives you a second wind.400,000 years ago people didnt jog for exercise. They didnt even have jogging shorts. Or sneakers.400,000 years ago people need to eat and live. And either youre running to catch a prey, or you are running from a lion. Youre the prey! And you need that second wind in both cases or you DIE.The same thing happens in the brain. When you are about to die, a second wind kicks in. Ideas, experiences, opportunity, and probably hidden forces and neurochemicals we dont understand.But you cant get runners high unless youre ALREADY in good shape. Unless you are already able to run long distances.This is why its important to exercise the idea muscle right now. If your idea muscle atrophies, then even at your lowest point you wont have any ideas.How long does it take this muscle to atrophy? The same as any other muscle in your body: just two weeks without having any ideas. Atrophied.If you lie down in a bed for two weeks and dont move your legs you will need physical therapy to walk again.Many people need idea therapy. Not so that they can come up with great ideas right this second (although maybe you will) but so that people can come up with ideas when they need them: when their car is stuck, when their house blows up, when they are fired from their job, when their spouse betrays them, when they go bankrupt or lose a big customer, or lose a client, or go out of business, or get sick.IDEAS ARE THE CURRENCY OF LIFE. Not money. Money gets depleted until you go broke. But good ideas buy you good experiences, buy you better ideas, buy you better experiences, buy you more time, save your life. Financial wealth is a side effect of the runners high of your idea muscle.Whoah! That was a big intro.",2014-08-08T13:31:55.000Z

How To Become A Master Of What You Love,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140714133303-5858595-how-to-become-a-master-of-what-you-love?trk=mp-reader-card,8482,312,39,2014-07-14 00:00:00,9.0,"On my podcast, ""The James Altucher Show"" (available at itunes or Stitcher) I had the chance to interview Robert Greene, author of ""Mastery"", ""The 48 Laws of Power"" and other books.   Before I interview anyone I read all of their books. By the time I was finished reading his books I thought I was the smartest guy in the world.   Robert's books are dense with great stories, information, and practical takeaways. They are unlike any other personal improvement /nonfiction books anywhere.   Only, I wasn't the smartest guy in the world. I was about to talk to him.   Here's a snippet of that interview. The rest is in the podcast. But this snippet is worth it.   I've spent my life trying to master whatever it was I was interested in. And most of the time I failed. But I don't think the failing is as important as the trying. When you are immersed in what you love, then you change the world.   If you move on to new loves or many loves, then that's fine also. You master the combination of everything you love. Then you are unique in the world.   Robert describes the process below:  JAMES ALTUCHER:  ... If you were going to give someone the five-minute summary of how to master a topic, what would be the most important factors to look at?  ROBERT GREENE:  The most important factor is chapter one in the book. You're never going to master something unless you understand this  The brain is designed to learn. We learn much better when we are emotionally engaged, when we want to learn, when we are motivated, when we feel the need to learn.   Let's say you have to learn French. If it's in the university, if it's something you have to study, you're not going to learn very much in one year.  But if you're in France and your girlfriend is French and you need to get a job and you need to speak French you're going to learn like 20 times faster because you're there and you're motivated. That's just how the brain works.  ALTUCHER:   So what's happening there though is first you find the girl, rather than first you say to yourself, ""I want to get good at French."" [Of course, I am missing the point entirely because there's mention of ""a girl"".]  GREENE:   Yes, that could be. But the point I'm making is that when you're motivated to learn something, you have to learn it.   You're going to learn much faster.   You're in France and you met this great girl. But she speaks no English, and you've got to be able to learn French in order to be able to communicate with and seduce her.  You're so highly motivated, you're going to learn 10 times, 20, 50 times faster than the university student back in New York or wherever you're studying.  So the thing is, a lot of people go wrong. They choose a career because it's about money. I have nothing against money. We all have to make a living.   But let's say you go into law because that's what your parents are pushing you into and other people. And it seems lucrative, but you aren't personally excited by it.  You're going to start tuning out. You aren't going to learn very fast. After 10 years, you're going to burn out.  You're never going to become a master, because it takes 10,000 hours. It's just a number, but let's say it is pretty real. It could be real.   It could be 9,000, 11,000. You're never going to have the patience. You're never going to be able to put in the 10 years or more of studying something unless you really are excited about it. Unless there is some kind of personal commitment to it.  So it's by far the most important thing. It's that choice of the career. It doesn't mean you have to know exactly what you want to be when you're 21 years old and then go pursue it.   It's going to be a process that might take you five or 10 years to figure out exactly what that is.  For me, it took 15 years for me to find out I should be writing books like the kind that I write. It's going to take time.   But if you don't make that first step  if you go into the wrong field  you're never going to become a master. You're never going to last long enough.  [Note: It could take many more years than 15. For me, it's taken a lifetime of changing and combining careers.]  ALTUCHER:  A big question that many people have is, how do I find the thing that I'm passionate about?   Now you mentioned five to six years, or 15 years in your case, in terms of wanting to be a writer. But what is that process by which someone finds what they are motivated enough to be a master of?  GREENE:   Well, everybody has a different process, a different journey.   Some people knew clearly what it was when they were young. I met a woman who interviewed me. She knew that she wanted to be a writer when she was a young girl and then she got into law and it was a dead end and she hated it. She finally figured it out that she had to go back at the age of 31 to what she really loved.   So there are going to be people like that. And there are others who come to me and say, ""I have no idea what my passion is. I have no idea what I really love.""  That's troubling because that means you're not listening to yourself. You're not aware of your own likes and dislikes. You have been paying too much attention to what other people are saying.   So you have to go through a process now of looking at yourself. I work as a consultant. I have dealt with people, many people, who say that to me.  They say, ""I am 35. I'm 40. I don't know what it is that I was meant to do. I really have no idea."" OK, let's go back and look at your childhood.   Let's look at the things that excited you. Let's look at maybe where you went wrong. Let's look at the things you hate. If you hate working for a large company, if you hate politicking, you're probably meant to be an entrepreneur, to be working for yourself in some level. Let's look at the subjects that really excite you when you open the newspaper or go online.  It could take a couple months, it could take a year. It depends on the person.   You're reconnecting to what I call a voice inside of you that you had when you were a kid, that drew you to certain activities that you have lost touch with.  I could go on for four hours about the process that I have dealt with in consulting. But it's basically not going to be overnight. You're not going to wake up and go, ""I should have been a doctor."" It isn't like that. It takes time, but it's so worth it.  ALTUCHER:  So after that first realization that ""OK, I'm motivated to be a writer"" or ""I'm motivated to discover more uses of electricity or to be an Internet entrepreneur,"" or whatever it is what would you say is the next step?  GREENE:   First of all, if you're 22 and about to enter the career world, it's usually a matter of ""I like this field, the sciences"" or ""I like sports"" or whatever. A general category of things that you're going to pursue.   For me, it was writing. So when I was 21, I decided I would go into journalism as a way to make a living and train myself as a writer.  You're going to make a choice of something to start with that is in some way related to that field that you love. And it can be kind of general. It can just be the tech world. Or it could be a business. It doesn't have to be specific. But you've got to make the right choice.  You want to think of your 20s as your apprenticeship. We don't use that word anymore, and it's a shame that we don't. We usually all go through the school system, the education system where we are all guided and there are teachers there to help us.   Now there is nobody there to do anything for you. Maybe your parents But really, nobody is there to guide you in this new part of your life, so you're CREATING YOUR OWN apprenticeship.  That apprenticeship means you're going to learn skills. It's NOT about making money.   If you're 22 and you're obsessed with making money, you're never going to really make a lot of money. It's a perverse law of human nature that I'm going to discuss.  The people who end up making the most amount of money are usually motivated by something else.   The classic example is Steve Jobs, somebody who from very early on was clearly not very interested in money. And look where he ended up. So you're choosing something that appeals to you and now you're open. I call it a journey.  You're going to discover you like what you're doing but there's something better for you. It's not exactly right. I knew that journalism, after three years, wasn't really right for me. So I went into a different kind of writing.   Well, you'll figure, ""Alright, I'll go into a different line of work, a different business. Still related."" And as you do this, you're going to be accumulating skills, experiences You're going to be observing people.  You're going to get political social skills. And by the time you're 31, you're going to own the world. You're going to have a lot of experience. And then you will be able to figure out how to combine everything you've learned into something great that really appeals to you.  I give examples in the book. I interviewed contemporary masters. One of those, Paul Graham, started a company called Y Combinator, which is an entrepreneur system for tech people in Silicon Valley. It's worth billions of dollars, and he is the same thing.   He didn't realize until he was 30 what it was that he was meant to do. But in his 20s, he had all of these amazing experiences that served as a foundation for what ended up being this great tech business that he created for Netscape back in the '90s.  So be prepared not to necessarily strike gold when you're 25 or 26. It's going to take some time. But if you think of it as your own education that you, yourself are in charge of you're going to be a lot better off than people who just wander around and just choose any career.  ALTUCHER:  Robert, this is a really important message now  even from an economics point of view  because what we're seeing is a disintegration of the middle class.   The middle class is formed by the conformity of the traditional school system the conformity of traditional corporatism where everybody feels that they are safe in their cubicle and they can rise up and get promotions and so on.  Whether it's become masters or close to masters People now have to take charge of their economic lives. That means they have to do something they are motivated by and interested in.   Even if they don't put in their 10,000 hours, they have to take control of their own lives. That's why this message has become critically important in today's society.  GREENE:   Yes. Take my father He worked at the same company for 40 years. They were loyal to him, and he was loyal to them.   It's not that long ago that a world existed where people would work at one place and things were sort of taken care of. But that's just been blown away, obliterated, probably by the Internet, by other things going on.  It might as well be the Year of the Dinosaur, and you cannot rely on the company you're working for now. It will downsize you the first chance it can. Or as soon as you reach a certain age, it'll replace you with somebody who is cheaper. That's just the nature of it.  I'm not saying it's good. I wish it wasn't that way. But my book is about being realistic, and that's just the nature of it. You've got to take control of your own life and craft and apprenticeship.  Now I want to clear up a misconception. It doesn't mean that you're playing chess for 10,000 hours and then you become a master of medicine or whatever. Those 10,000 hours can come from different things you have done in your life.   So for instance, this woman that I mentioned who spent her 20s in law and realized it was the wrong thing, she decided when it was finished, she would become a writer about legal issues, which was a brilliant move on her part.  All that legal experience added up to 3,000 or 4,000 hours already of writing about legal matters. And then she started getting into journalism, and now the hours are piling up.   You can take that time you think you wasted doing something else and apply it to something that really appeals to you. Suddenly, all that experience enters into practice.  I did a lot of really bad jobs myself because as a writer, I wanted a lot of experience. I did construction work, etc. And all those jobs taught me about people and about weird power situations. And about the games bosses play and all different kinds of careers.  So you can be 35, and you're not going to go, ""Oh, dammit, I can't do 10,000 hours, my life is screwed."" NO, you have already probably done 5,000 hours. Now you have to find a way to apply it in a way that's appropriate and personal.  ALTUCHER:  That's a great way to look at it. It's almost like your past Don't view it as you have messed up, but how you have built these prior hours as a safety net that you can then use to build either mastery or close to mastery so that you can make that leap from the job that you're not really excited about to something you're more excited about.  Not everyone is a Mozart. But everyone can use the hours they have built up to build some sort of safety net for themselves, if they apply your techniques.  What is the relationship between mastery and happiness? You used the example earlier of Steve Jobs, but let's throw in Mozart and Napoleon and Tesla. These people did not end up as happy people, by and large.  GREENE:   Well, I would really take issue with that. Steve Jobs was a tempestuous person who had a very obsessive personality. But I would say, judging on the biography, the last 12 years of his life must have been immensely satisfying. And it depends on your definition of happiness.  The book is called Mastery. It's not called Happiness. If I wanted to write a book on happiness, I'd go take drugs and hang out in Peru on a hilltop or something. That's not what my book is about. But I will say I make the point that everybody has creative potential.  And the worst feeling in life comes from the sense as you get older that you didn't somehow tap that potential. You're not expressing what you think you could have expressed and it makes a lot of people very, very unhappy.  Mozart had a great life when he finally left his father. He died young, but I would claim he was happy. I don't think a lot of these people who we see as driven are necessarily unhappy. They do spend a lot of time with their work, and they are maybe obsessive.  But that kind of attention to detail  to doing what you love  brings a sense of satisfaction that maybe isn't the same satisfaction that you might get from an immediate rush of going to a party.  It's a different kind of happiness. It's something a little more like fulfillment. And I believe that mastery is the path towards that.  I have a quote in there from da Vinci, which I love. It's basically just  ""A day when you have worked hard brings a blessed sleep. A life in which you fulfilled what you're doing brings a blessed death.""  I'm quoting it horribly, but the idea is if you feel like you realized your potential, you almost feel like you can die a happy person.",2014-07-14T13:33:03.000Z
How To Persuade Anyone Of Anything In Ten Seconds,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140711133208-5858595-how-to-persuade-anyone-of-anything-in-ten-seconds?trk=mp-reader-card,5613,137,26,2014-07-11 00:00:00,9.0,"You're on the most important elevator ride of your life. You have ten seconds to pitch- the classic ""elevator pitch"".Love or Hate. Money or Despair. And you may never get this chance again. As PM Dawn says, ""I feel for you. I really do.""There are books about this. But don't waste your time. They are all garbage.I've been on both sides of this equation. I've had people pitching me.But mostly, I've been scared and desperate and afraid to ask someone to give me, want me, love me, all in the space of an elevator ride or in the time it takes one to ride an elevator.Perhaps the hardest thing for me was when I was doing my ""3am"" web series for HBO.I had to walk up to random strangers at 3 in the morning on the streets of New York and convince them within 5 seconds to spill their most intimate secrets to me rather than kill me.Not quite an elevator pitch but the same basic idea. I had a lot of practice. I probably approached over 3000 people cold.In some cases people tried to kill me. In one case I was chased. In other cases people opened up their hearts and I am infinitely grateful to them.The below ideas have worked for me in the hundreds of times I've had to be persuasive. Either in writing, or in person. In business and in friendships and in love. I hope variations on it can work for you. You decide.A) WHO ARE YOU?People want to know they are talking to a good, honest, reliable person that they can trust and perhaps even like, or love.Yes, love.They won't love you by looking at your resume.You have to do method acting. Imagine what your body would feel like if they already said ""Yes"" even before you open your mouth.You would be standing up straight, smiling, palms open, ready to close the deal. You have to method act at the beginning of your pitch.If you are slouched and your head is sticking out then your brain is not as well-connected to your nervous system and you won't be in ""flow"".I can drag out the science here but this is a LinkedIn post and not a peer-reviewed scientific paper for the Justice League of America.The reality is: when you're slouched over, not only are you not using the full potential of your brain, but you look untrustworthy.B) RELAXThink about how you breathe when you are anxious and nervous.I will tell you how I breathe: short, shallow breaths in my upper chest.So do the reverse before a ten second pitch.Breathe deep and in your stomach. Even three deep breaths in the stomach (and when you exhale try to imagine your stomach almost hitting your back) has been shown to totally relax the mind and body.People sense this. Again, this builds trust and relaxes you.Now, even though you haven't said a single word, you've probably done the two most important things for persuading someone.C) UHHH. YEAH. UHHH. MMMM-HMMM. UH-HUHI have a hard time with this. It seems natural to say, ""yup"" or ""right"" or ""uh-huh"" or whatever.But here's the facts (and, again, there's been studies on this): people perceive you as stupid when you do this.Just keep quiet when someone is talking.Then, when someone is done speaking, wait for two seconds before responding. They might not be done yet. And it gives you time to think of a response. If you are thinking of a response while they are talking, then you aren't listening to them.People unconsciously know when you are not listening to them. Then they say No to you.D) THE FOUR U'sFINALLY, now we're getting to the heart of the matter. THE ACTUAL NUTS AND BOLTS OF PERSUASION.By the way, I've googled ""the 4 U's"" and each time I get a different set of 4. So I'm going to use the 4 that have worked for me the best.This is not BS. This is not a way to convince someone to do something they don't want to do. This is a way for you to consolidate your vision into a sentence or two and then express it in a clear manner.This is the way to bond and connect with another person's needs instead of just your own pathetic wants.You can use this in an elevator pitch, on a date, with your children, on your mother, whatever. But it works.Think about these things when talking:",2014-07-11T13:32:08.000Z

11 or 12 Things I Learned About Life While...,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140623123605-5858595-11-or-12-things-i-learned-about-life-while-daytrading-millions-of-dollars?trk=mp-reader-card,24656,394,123,2014-06-23 00:00:00,10.0,"I was a day trader for many years, and it almost killed me.I made money by making profits on my own money and also taking a percentage of the profits for the people I traded for. I traded up to $40 million or $50 million a day at my peak. I did this from 2001 to 2004.I learned about day trading but I also learned a lot about myself and what I was good at, what I was horrible at, and what I was psychotic at. Things that had nothing to do with day trading.Day trading is the best job in the world on the days you make money. You make a trade, then maybe 20 minutes later you are out of the trade with a profit, and for the rest of the day you think about how much money you made.Its the worst job in the world on a bad day. I would make a trade, it would go against me, and then I wanted my heart to stop so my blood would stop thumping so loudly.I did it for years, though, because I was unemployable in every other way.Heres what I learned. All of these lessons I will certainly use today, many years after I stopped day trading.A) You cant predict the future. Everyone thinks they can. But they cant.This applies not just to trading but everything. You could be married for 10 years and the next thing you know you are divorced and you would not have predicted that.You could be healthy all your life and drink your vegetables and exercise and reduce stress, and a year later you could be dead from cancer.Youd have much less stress if you let go of trying to predict the future.You can always seek to increase the odds in your favor. If I dont jump off bridges, for instance, its more likely Ill be alive a year from now. But certainly a path to unhappiness is thinking the future can be predicted and controlled.B) Hope is not a strategy.If you get to the point where you hope you dont get ruined, then you did something wrong beforehand.For instance, if you plan a wedding outside and you dont have a backup plan in case it rains, then you probably mis-planned your wedding, unless you are getting married in a desert.Hoping is not a bad thing. I hope that every day my life goes perfectly.But if hoping is the only thing Im relying on, then it means I didnt really look at all the possible outcomes of something that was important to me.C) Uncertainty is your best friend.A hundred percent of opportunities in life are created because people are uncertain about almost everything in their lives.We are constantly trying to close the enormous gap between the things we are certain about and the things we are uncertain about, and almost every invention, product, Internet service, book, whatever has been created to help us close that gap.Sometimes this is hard. If your husband betrays and leaves you, you often feel like crawling on the floor and burning all the self-help books. They all lied.Its hard to feel in the now or to positive think when life feels like its over. Ive tried. For me its too hard.But at the very least you can say help me. You can say it to your close friends. You can say it something inside of yourself.Help me is the most powerful, and most forgotten, prayer.D) Taking risks versus reducing risk. Some people take too many risks and they go bankrupt. This happened to me. And sometimes people are too cautious and dont take enough risks.When I first started day trading, I was so afraid of risk that if I had a small profit, Id end the trade. But then I would take big losses and that would wipe out all my profits.The key is that you can take larger and larger risks if you work on better and better ways to deal with those risks.For instance, I might be able to risk marrying someone if I know she is not a hard-core drug addict who regularly betrays the people she is close to.I can risk driving without a license if I always stay below the speed limit (I know this is a stupid risk, but still). Once you have a method of reducing risks, its easier to make trades or decisions about anything.E) Diversification.Often I get emails, I really want ONE job but they dont seem to want me and now Im miserable. How can I get that job?Well you cant.And youre going to be unhappy. You cant wish yourself a job.When I was raising money to day trade, I probably contacted over 1,000 people. When I was starting an Internet business I started over a dozen Internet businesses and watched all of them fail but one. When I was trying to sell my Internet business I contacted over a dozen companies (although Google broke my heart  damn you Google!).When I wanted to get married, I went on lots of dates. Claudias approach was even smarter  she wouldnt waste time with dinners. She would only go to tea with guys. Within the first 20 seconds you know if you are attracted. So keep it to a tea.F) Say no.In day trading, if something is not working out, even if your heart wants it to work out, you have to say No and cut your losses.If a business relationship is not working out, dont put more energy and time into it.There is a cognitive bias called committment bias. We think because weve already put time and energy (or money) into something that we have to stick with it. But this is just a mental bias. Say no to it.You have to decide every moment if this is the situation you want to be in.Just because you were in the situation a moment ago, or yesterday, or for 10 years, doesnt mean the situation is right for you anymore.G) Health.Day trading pulls everything out of you. It sucks the soul out of your body, blends it up, and then explodes. It doesnt turn into a nice smoothie. It explodes.So you have to take care of yourself. If you dont sleep enough, if you dont eat well, exercise, be around positive people, be grateful for what you have, blah blah blah, you will lose all of your money and go bankrupt.And obviously, this applies to everything else in life. Every day, what small thing can you do to become a slightly better you?The reason we get so attracted to safe cubicle jobs is that the pain is more subtle and sneaks up on us. Its not the blender-drama of day trading so the need for health on a daily basis doesnt seem as important. But it is.H) Laughter. The only way to survive is to laugh. Theres that saying: Man makes plans but God laughs. Well, you might as well be on the same side as God.I) This is crazy means youre crazy.Ive seen it a million times. Guy makes a trade. The market goes against him. He says this is crazy and puts more money into the trade. And then he loses all his money and goes crazy. Ive had to talk people off the ledge or tell them to put the gun down.The market is never crazy. The world is never crazy. And I will go so far as to say that your girlfriend who just lied to you about where she spent the night is not crazy.I only care about you. And youre effin crazy if you thought the world was going to line up any other way than the way it lined up.Tough on you.I know when I feel like, ugh, this situation is insane that the first place I need to look is at me.I am insane.J) It doesnt matter if a trade (or a day, or a life) is good or bad. Good and bad days happen. But life is about a billion little moments that add up to all the things around you. If you let one of those moments have too much control then you are bound to be mostly miserable.I was mostly miserable during the period I was day trading. I let that aspect of my life take control. So I stopped focusing on being a good husband, a good father, a good friend, a good anything.All of my other constituencies went to hell.I would have nightmares. I would lose sleep. I would wake up many mornings and go to the church across the street so I could be by myself and pray. What would I pray? Jesus, please make the markets go in my direction today.Im Jewish. Nobody answered my prayers.K) Its never about the money.Every day I get emails like, Can you show me how to day trade?NO!I know a thousand day traders and only two that wont go bankrupt. So what makes anyone think they will have an edge? How many people listen to me?Zero.How come?Because people are sick of their lives, their relationships, their jobs, and all the lies that have been told to them ever since they learned how to walk.They want freedom from the BS.I get it.Day trading is the dream. You can make enough money to not care. To do it from anywhere. To be happy.It wont work. But people dont want to believe it. Most people think they have that one special something that will make it work for them.And its true  they do have that one special something. But you cant get there by day trading first. You can skip right to the being happy part. You can skip right to being free.But we never learned that. We were taught we had to do something first to earn freedom.

10 Things To Do When They Don't Call Back,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140612133859-5858595-10-things-to-do-when-they-don-t-call-back?trk=mp-reader-card,76479,815,308,2014-06-12 00:00:00,11.0,"I pitched a TV show and they loved it. I was going to mike up tables in a restaurant and tape record dates. I would know the woman (she was beautiful, funny, etc) and the guy would not know he was being videotaped.We created a reel (two dates). One guy admitted in the middle of the date he was confused about whether or not he was gay. Another guy got a call from his wife in the middle of the date. Great stuff. Great TV as they say in the Biz.I pitched it to Dave Bartolis who worked at HBO Independent Productions. They loved it. He was going to call me back the next day. He didnt. Or the day after that. I would call his office. His secretary would say he was on the other line. I can hold. Oh, hell call you right back.He didnt.Finally I called his home number. Oh, uh, we LOVE the idea. Ill call you tomorrow.He didnt. Or the next day Repeat the whole process above.Another time someone wanted to buy a company I had started. They came around, they LOVED the company. It would fit right in with their company. Their company was named Google. I wont get into it. They didnt call back. Same as above. I didnt call anyone at home this time. I had gotten better. But I had wet dreams at night. And then I would cry as the sun rose.Why wouldnt they call me back?And then a girl. We were apart for a vacation. She was going out to dinner with her ex. Shell call me AS SOON AS she gets back. I fall asleep. At 3am I wake up and realized I never got a call. So I call. No answer. Why didnt she call me back? Where is she? Two months later she was pregnant. Who was the father?Sometimes I hate the phone, emails, Facebook, Twitter, the call back. Why am I sitting here. Waiting. Dont they realize Im waiting? Dont they want to talk to me: give me money, love, sex, fortune, fame, even just a little respect or generosity? You would give me those things. Wont you?A) Expand your alternative ideas. When you are waiting for ONE person on ONE idea, youre screwed. You are in a perpetual state of I need this or I die. So we need to prevent you from dying. Heres the surgery you must perform. Find at least one more idea you are excited about. There was one time I was raising a fund. People werent calling back. I decided, ok, time to focus on creating a business of skin care products. Eventually, I raised the fund.B) Expand your list of people to call.  Why did I just call HBO Independent Productions? Why didnt I call Showtime? Or Comedy Central. I knew all the people. EVERYONE wouldve said. I LOVE THIS at the same time. This is the key to getting people to call you back. Even if nobody individually plans on calling you back, if everyone is saying, I LOVE THIS, someone will call you back.C) Just DO it. I had two dates in the can. They were perfect. We did a third date. The guy wouldnt sign the release form unless the girl, my friend, would have sex with him. Another perfect date in the can. Why did I need HBO to pick me? PICK YOURSELF! I couldve just done fifteen of those dates and I wouldve had a perfect documentary. Or a complete pilot that I did myself without the help of any studio. I no longer pitch books to publishers who might sit on them for months. I PICK MYSELF. I no longer wait for buyers to come knocking on my doors for companies. I make the calls and SELL my company. And I DUMPED any girl who I was suspicious of.D) Repeat: infinite patience brings immediate results."" This is a saying from something. Claudia told me. So I dont want to plagiarize. Even though I am right now. But, truly, deep inside, I dont, because I wish it were my original quote.I cannot even begin to tell you how amazing this quote is. Every time I think I need ONE thing to happen to make me happy, I repeat the above quote and follow some of the ideas below to take my mind off of the ONE thing and its amazing the result. Something else happens and its usually better.Einstein discovered that time is relative. My guess is, he was waiting for a girl to call him back when he made this discovery. Because everyone does run on a different schedule. One guy might say, Ill call you back tomorrow or so and that might mean two weeks for him and it might mean fifteen minutes for you. And time expands exponentially the more ideas, the more choices, and the more you are capable of PICKING YOURSELF and doing also the below items. Infinite patience then does, surprisingly, produces IMMEDIATE results. I cant describe further. You have to try it. Its magic.E) Work out or have sex. When you have a great meeting or phone call or date and you are now waiting for a follow up, its really similar to your body being mugged. When you are mugged the adrenalin inside of you spikes up to unheard of levels. Its the Fight or Flight syndrome. You MUST fight or your MUST flee.Instead... you are sitting, immobile, by the phone. But the adrenalin is still there, building up, unsure why you are not fighting or fleeing. Then you die. That would suck pretty bad just because somebody didnt call you back.So you have to get your body moving. Working out, sweating, sex  release all the adrenalin, get the endorphins or domamine or whatever the latest hormone they are calling it, running through your body to fight the adrenalin.F) Clean. Yeah, take a shower. You stink. Youve been sitting by that phone for days. Scrub with one of those hard brushes that take the dead cells off your skin and really open up your pores. Then turn the shower on super hot so you start to sweat it all out. All the pain, all of the Why didnt she call back that has buried itself into the molecules in your arms, legs, face, head.And then clean your house. It looks like shit in here. This is a reflection of what your brain looks like. Clean it all up.Then throw stuff out. Why are you even keeping all these extra books around that you read ten years ago. Are you ever going to read The Hobbit ever again for the rest of your life? And yet, every time youve moved since high school, youve carried that book with you. But its a special edition with drawings! Throw it out!Then clean your expenses. Do you really need to buy that extra book, t-shirt, movie, taxicab, hot dog, glass of wine? Clean everything. Theres a saying that all the cells in your body change every seven years. This may or may not be true. I have no idea. Everyone says it. But its also true about mental cells, emotional cells, spiritual cells. In fact, those might change every few months. Make sure the new cells have a fresh clean home to come to. Youre disgusting, sitting there by the phone.Clean up.G) Dont Guess. Well, its the holiday season so they must be busy to call but they will call right afterwards. Or, this is good news. It probably means they are running it up to their board and getting final approvals. Or, she got home early but didnt want to wake me. She knows I like to go to sleep early. Dont try to guess what they are doing or why they are not calling back.I have this big problem. Im obsessive. Combined with being a chess player. I look down every angle. Over and over. I picture everything ten moves ahead as to why they are not calling back. And I usually find two variations: the one that works best for me and the one that works the worst for me. And I obsess on both.What a waste of time. Dont guess. 99 times out of 100 you are wrong. And the one time you are right out of the 100 its for the wrong reasons and, by the way, its your worst case scenario. Congrats on being right.H) Dont Judge. When I was going to start writing for thestreet.com, Jim Cramer was excited about my ideas and introduced me to Dave Morrow (R.I.P.) who was editor in chief. Jim said, use this guy! to Dave about me. I would call Dave and call him and call him and he would never call back or he would say, Ill call back tomorrow. What a godamn drag!Finally I said to a friend of mine, thats it! I dont even want to write for a company that treats people like this.And he said, you need to calm the fuck down. Once you start writing for them youll never even deal with this Dave character anymore. And then youll be writing for thestreet.com. It will be great for you.And eventually Dave did call back, I started writing, I sold Stockpickr to them, and I hardly ever dealt with Dave (R.I.P.) which leads to an important corollary but Ill make it a separate point:I) Life is Short. They didnt call back. They never will. Youll call them and argue with them and plead with them and beg with them. The baby will be aborted. The company wont get bought or sold. The deal will never be signed. The money wont be raised. The TV show wont get done.But in 60-80 years well all be dead. Tiny dots. On a tiny planet. Remember back to the days before the Big Bang happened. When we were all just happy being pre-nothing, before information even existed. Well, that will happen again. See you then, buddy.J) Dont be afraid. Youre sitting by the phone, sweating. Is she having sex with someone else? Are they never going to buy my company? Its Friday afternoon, am I really going to have to wait until Monday when they said they would call back by the end of the week with the decision?Dont be afraid my poor little child. Youre waiting by the phone because you had the brush with love, the first kiss, the smile, the intent, the ambition, the ideas, the ability to network and connect, the assets to sell, the clients to introduce, the companies to build.I want to hold you and hug you. You dont need the call back to be happy. You dont need to be scared. Everything that ever will happen to you starts from just a seed. Plant more seeds.Be fruitful and multiply.",2014-06-12T13:38:59.000Z
